Okay. Thanks, Mike. What we'll do is start on Page 4 of the deck. And I just want to take a moment and reflect on 2017 because by any measure,<br>
2017 was a remarkable year. It was remarkable for our country, for our industry where we operate and for AT&amp;T. And it's been a long time since<br>

JANUARY 31, 2018 / 9:30PM, T - Q4 2017 AT&amp;T Inc Earnings Call<br>
we've seen so many, what I would call, major public policy achievements compressed into a single year like we saw last year. And we're calling<br>
these achievements because the combined impact from these is going to be growth. It's going to be growth in U.S. investment, in jobs and in<br>
wages. And all of this began early in 2017 as regulations across all industries were being rationalized.<br>
In our industry specifically, the FCC returned us to a light-touch regulation of the Internet. And this was the approach that up until 2015 had allowed<br>
the Internet to flourish and the U.S. tech sector to lead the world in innovation. So we obviously believe this was a step in the right direction. But<br>
this regulatory pendulum is going to keep swinging back and forth unless Congress steps forward and writes new laws to govern all Internet<br>
companies and to protect the consumer.<br>
We believe that we need clarity. We need a long-term predictability on the rules of the Internet and on customer privacy. So we're calling for an<br>
Internet Bill of Rights. And you can expect us to take a leadership role on this as the discussion progresses.<br>
But unquestionably, the biggest development that came out of Washington last year was around tax reform. Our public policymakers pulled the<br>
greatest lever they had available to them to stimulate capital investment in job creation and wage growth. That lever was giving U.S. companies<br>
a competitive tax system, one that levels the playing field with the rest of the world. We're very early in the process, but you've seen it. Company<br>
after company is already announcing increased investment, hiring, wage increases and employee bonuses, and we were first out of the gate.<br>
We announced bonuses for more than 200,000 frontline employees and a voluntary medical plan contribution for a total of $1 billion. And we also<br>
increased our 2018 capital expenditures by another $1 billion.<br>
So while public policy stole a lot of the spotlight, we did make a lot of progress on several strategic initiatives last year. The most important is<br>
FirstNet, winning that FirstNet bid. And this was going to prove to be the foundation for taking wireless network performance to a completely new<br>
level. What we're doing is building a nationwide network with the latest technology. It's designed and it's hardened for America's first responders.<br>
And then that will be our foundation for broad 5G deployment.<br>
We're well underway with the build, including new sites in unserved or underserved rural parts of the country. We plan to deploy 40 megahertz of<br>
fallow spectrum that we've accumulated over the last few years along with the spectrum from FirstNet. And we'll also be deploying the millimeter<br>
wave spectrum from our FiberTower purchase, and this is going to give us a quantum leap in both capacity and performance.<br>
If we move to Mexico. I'm really pleased with how the team is executing. They're doing so well. We added 3 million customers in 2017. We also<br>
made great progress leading the industry in terms of software-defined networking: 55% of our network is now virtualized. And as a result, you're<br>
seeing our networking and our IT cost structure falling significantly.<br>
We also made progress moving our base of our high-value customers into multiproduct bundles, saving them money, driving down churn and<br>
earning more of their overall spend. And you can see the fruits of the strategy in our strong wireless performance this quarter and DIRECTV NOW's<br>
terrific first year in the market. Our fiber build continued to go strong. We now reach more than 7 million customer locations and expect to double<br>
that in the next 18 months.<br>
So that's a look at 2017. And what I want to do now is move forward to 2018 and talk about our priorities this year, and that's on Slide 5. And it's<br>
no surprise, our top priority for 2018 is closing our deal to acquire Time Warner. We were obviously surprised when the government decided to<br>
try and block the merger because it is a classic vertical merger between 2 companies that don't even compete with one another. And with 50 years<br>
of legal precedent, it's the type of business combination that the government has consistently approved with appropriate conditions.<br>
Now while we remain open to finding some reasonable solutions to address the government's concern, we do expect this case will ultimately be<br>
litigated in court. The trial date is set to begin March 19, and we remain very confident that we'll complete this merger.<br>
We're also going to be laser-focused in 2018 on building the world's premier gigabit network. And again, FirstNet, combined with our fiber and<br>
our 5G deployment, is giving us a powerful platform to accelerate our move into a gigabit world. And I got to tell you, I love our position here. We<br>
expect to be the first U.S. company to launch mobile 5G service by the end of this year, and our fixed 5G trials are also going very well.<br>

JANUARY 31, 2018 / 9:30PM, T - Q4 2017 AT&amp;T Inc Earnings Call<br>
We're learning a lot. We're gaining great insights into making this product a very strong commercial offering. And then last week, the FCC issued<br>
an order that cleared the way for us to move forward with our acquisition of FiberTower and the vast majority of its millimeter wave spectrum<br>
licenses is what's required for 5G. So we get from FiberTower an average of nearly 360 megahertz of nationwide spectrum. And again, millimeter<br>
wave, it's critical for our 5G strategy and we'll be putting this spectrum to work later this year.<br>
In video, we're going to launch our next-generation platform this spring. This platform will add cloud DVR capabilities. It will give us a third stream<br>
to DIRECTV NOW, and it'll have a lot of further enhancements to the user interface. Now I've been using this thing recently, and I got to tell you, I<br>
think our customers are really going to like this. The experience is very good.<br>
And so then before year-end, we plan to launch the next-gen product in a home-centric configuration with a very thin hardware client. And just<br>
think about it this way, it's a very small, inexpensive streaming device plugged into your TV and then you connect it to any broadband service. It<br>
will be a voice-controlled user interface with an integrated search feature. And it will allow you to search across any streaming video service that<br>
you subscribe to. So it can be DIRECTV NOW, Netflix, Amazon, Hulu or even YouTube. It also gives you a premium live video experience in your<br>
home with the flexibility and the ease-of-use, what you would expect out of an OTT service.<br>
We're also ramping up our advertising and analytics business. This is being led by Brian Lesser, who joined us last quarter. I think he's one of the<br>
best minds in ad tech. We're really excited about this opportunity because advertisers have made it really clear to us that they're looking for a<br>
trusted option in premium video advertising, looking for an alternative to the current digital ad duopoly that can bring advertisers scale and deliver<br>
results that are transparent and brand-safe.<br>
Once Time Warner closes, we'll be well positioned to be that alternative. We think the entire industry -- advertisers, publishers and consumers --<br>
are more than ready for this alternative. And with Time Warner, we believe we'll have the right data, the right content and the right talent to build<br>
an automated advertising platform that can transform premium video and TV advertising.<br>
2018, we're also going to be focused further on Mexico. Our business there is going to continue to scale. We continue to move towards profitability.<br>
We have great momentum in the market, nearly doubling our subscriber base in the last 2-plus years. And our LTE build in Mexico is almost complete.<br>
And then finally, our industry-leading cost structure is proving to be a significant competitive advantage. We obsess over delivering the lowest<br>
cost per megabyte in the world, and we still have a lot of room to go. So that's kind of a synopsis of what we'll be focused on in 2018.<br>
What I'm going to do now is hand it off to John to give you a report on the fourth quarter and our outlook for 2018. So John?<br>
John Joseph Stephens - AT&amp;T Inc. - Senior EVP &amp; CFO<br>
Thanks, Randall, and thanks for joining us on the call. Let me begin with our financial summary, which is on Slide 7.<br>
The positive impact of tax reform led to some significant changes in both our reported fourth quarter and annual results. This impacted our balance<br>
sheet and fourth quarter earnings. It also led to us making some important decisions that impacted our fourth quarter cash flows.<br>
We'll walk through these impacts as we discuss the results. Revenues were essentially flat year-over-year as a strong quarter in wireless equipment<br>
and in our international operations mostly offset declines in legacy wireless and video services. Adjusted consolidated operating margins in the<br>
quarter were down year-over-year due to healthy increases in wireless sales and expenses from our Entertainment Group, offsetting, though, solid<br>
growth in our international operations. But for the full year, operating margins were up 40 basis points.<br>
In the fourth quarter, our adjusted EPS was $0.78, including a $0.13 positive impact from tax reform. Essentially, our ability to fully expense capital<br>
spending in the fourth quarter generated most of this benefit. Remember, tax reform expensing provisions were effective retroactively to September<br>
27 of 2017.<br>

JANUARY 31, 2018 / 9:30PM, T - Q4 2017 AT&amp;T Inc Earnings Call<br>
We also made a number of other decisions with regard to tax -- with tax reform in mind, including the $200 million in bonus payments to our<br>
frontline employees, an $800 million funding of our employee and retiree medical trusts, nearly $100 million funding of our AT&amp;T Charitable<br>
Foundation and a number of other steps.<br>
Adjustments for the fourth quarter include these special items: a $20 billion gain from our preliminary estimate of net deferred tax liability reductions<br>
generated by the new tax law, asset write-offs in our copper plant as our consumer fiber footprint continues to expand and we continue to serve<br>
new customers with those fiber capabilities, and additional storm and natural disaster impacts. And in the fourth quarter, those are primarily from<br>
Puerto Rico. Other adjustments include our annual mark-to-market pension plan remeasurement and merger and integration costs, amortizations<br>
and some other adjustments.<br>
Free cash flow was up for the quarter and was $17.6 billion for the year, even with the $1 billion of benefit payments made in connection with tax<br>
reform. CapEx for the full year also came in on target at just under $22 billion. Let's now take a look at our operations, starting with mobility, where<br>
the team turned in outstanding customer growth. Those details are on Slide 8.<br>
AT&amp;T's domestic mobility operations, as you know, are divided between the Business Solutions and customer wireless segments. For comparison<br>
purposes, the company is providing supplemental information for its total U.S. wireless operations, and that's what I'll discuss today.<br>
First off, we added 329,000 postpaid phone customers in the quarter, a significant increase on both the year-over-year and sequential basis. Postpaid<br>
smartphone net additions were even more at 400,000. Altogether, we had more than 2.7 million new subscribers with gains in postpaid, prepaid<br>
and connected devices. And looking at the full year, we added more than 2 million of our most valuable branded smartphone subscribers to our<br>
base.<br>
One big reason for this success is reduced churn. Postpaid phone churn continues to run at record levels, dropping to 0.89% in the quarter. Revenues<br>
were up in the quarter thanks to strong smartphone sales. These sales also had an impact on margins. We had a year-over-year increase of 700,000<br>
smartphone gross adds and upgrades in the quarter as our customers kept coming back and getting new phones.<br>
Our BOGO offer was also successful and helped drive this volume increase. This growth impacted margins. But with record low postpaid phone<br>
churn, these customers will provide financial benefits years into the future. With these and many other efforts, we expect service revenues to<br>
improve throughout the coming year and turn positive for the year.<br>
We take a disciplined approach in building our customer base. We'll continue to be keenly focused on cost management, but also look for efficient<br>
opportunities to reinvest in our customers and continue growing. Now let's take a look at our Entertainment Group results.<br>
Total video customers, IP broadband connections and bundles all grew. DIRECTV NOW had a tremendous customer growth in its first year of<br>
operation. The 368,000 net adds in the fourth quarter gives us nearly 1.2 million customers in service, and we believe the best is yet to come.<br>
As Randall mentioned, we're close to launching our second-generation platform. We're excited about the improved customer experience the<br>
platform will bring and the new revenue opportunities that will come along with it. These will include the cloud-based DVR, an additional video<br>
stream to the 2 we offer today and a more robust video-on-demand experience.<br>
You're also seeing us turn the corner with our broadband business. IP broadband gains continue to be robust even as the conversion of DSL<br>
customers to IP slows as the consumer DSL customer base dropped below 1 million. We added nearly 600,000 IP broadband customers during<br>
2017.<br>
Broadband penetration rates in our fiber footprint, where we have marketed our fiber service more than 24 months, are nearing 50%. Last year<br>
alone, we doubled the number of IP broadband subscribers in our fiber footprint. A big part of our subscriber success can be attributed to the<br>
integrated offers that we have. We continue to increase the number of bundled customers.<br>

The number of households who take both video and wireless increased by 160,000 in the quarter or about 700,000 more wireless customers who<br>
bundle with video. That's significant because the churn rate of our DIRECTV customers who have our wireless service is nearly half that of stand-alone<br>
satellite subscribers. At the same time, we continue to work through the ongoing transition of the pay-TV industry. This transition pressures revenues<br>
and margins. We will manage this transition as we have managed other transitions over the year, but expect the pressure to continue throughout<br>
2018.<br>
Now let's look at Business Solutions results on Slide 9. Wireless drove growth in our Business Solutions segment, but we also saw a sequential<br>
improvement in our wireline revenue trends. Wireless revenues were up 6% on the strength of smartphone sales while service revenues were<br>
essentially flat. Wireline revenues were down 3.5% year-over-year, an improvement over previous quarters and up nearly 1% sequentially. We now<br>
have 1.8 million business customer locations connected with fiber. That means more sales opportunities for the team. We also expect increased<br>
business activity following the passage of tax reform.<br>
Margins felt the impact of increased smartphone sales, but wireline margins were up significantly to 37.8%, something like 270 basis point increase,<br>
as we continue to drive hard on cost-management initiatives. A big part of these cost savings come from our move to a virtualized network. More<br>
than 55% of our network functions were virtualized by the end of '17, and there is still more opportunity as we drive towards our goal of 75% of<br>
these functions virtualized by 2020.<br>
Our International business also turned in another strong quarter. Those results are on the bottom of Slide 9. We had growth across our operations.<br>
Revenues were up 16% as both DIRECTV Latin America and Mexico showed strong revenue and subscriber gains. EBITDA also was up significantly<br>
thanks to strength in Latin America and improvement in Mexico.<br>
Subscriber growth continues to be strong in Mexico. The 1.3 million net adds in the quarter pushed our full year growth to more than 3 million<br>
and our total subscriber base to more than 15 million. And our Latin American satellite operations added 139,000 customers thanks to the strength<br>
in their prepaid products. The business continues to be profitable and generate positive free cash flow. Our business units turned in a great fourth<br>
quarter, but we also have done an excellent job managing our balance sheet during the quarter. Those highlights are on Slide 10.<br>
We take pride in the disciplined management of our balance sheet. We see it as a competitive advantage and value generator for our shareholders.<br>
It's the foundation our company is built on and gives us the strength and flexibility we need to invest and to grow. That foundation became even<br>
stronger in 2017 thanks to tax reform and thoughtful measures we undertook.<br>
First, we derisked the existing debt portfolio by extending maturities, primarily beyond 10 years, as we prepare to close the Time Warner deal. And<br>
we did it cost effectively, without significantly increasing our interest rates. Our weighted average maturity is now 14.5 years at a weighted average<br>
interest rate of 4.4%. And we've diversified our portfolio with about 1/4 of the debt denominated in foreign currency. This gives us ample near-term<br>
liquidity to meet the demands of the business and provide solid, long-term returns to our shareholders.<br>
Second, our terrific cash flow generation enabled us to invest in growth, improve leverage ratios and improve dividend coverage, with a payout<br>
ratio of 68% in 2017. And with the passage of tax reform, we see a significant boost to our balance sheet, reducing $20 billion of liabilities and<br>
increasing shareholder equity by a like amount. This reform significantly improves our net debt to equity ratios as well as free cash flow and dividend<br>
coverage in future years.<br>
We also are in excellent shape with our pension plan. Our pension plan assets returned over 14% for the year, and we are nearly fully funded, with<br>
no significant cash contributions required for at least 5 years. This is the case even with a historically low discount rate. If you apply the average<br>
5-year discount rate to our plan, it is essentially fully funded. And at the average 10-year rate, it's actually overfunded.<br>
Coming from this strong position, we plan to increase our investment allocation to fixed income assets and lower our expected return on pension<br>
assets down to 7% from the current 7 3/4% assumption. All these measures have a profound impact on our financial position, and I would expect<br>
the rating agencies will take notice and begin updating their models. It certainly has changed our outlook on capital budgeting, improving the<br>
returns of a whole range of products.<br>

JANUARY 31, 2018 / 9:30PM, T - Q4 2017 AT&amp;T Inc Earnings Call<br>
As promised, we'll increase 2018 capital investments by $1 billion with tax reform. Even with that, we expect significant free cash flow growth in<br>
2018 and going forward, with our dividend payout ratio improving into the high 50% range this year. And we are committed to deleveraging after<br>
Time Warner closes with plans to return to historic levels by the end of [2020], if not before. Our management team has worked hard to build and<br>
maintain a strong balance sheet. We also know the job is never done. But 2018 brings tax reform, FirstNet and a new accounting standard that will<br>
affect our financial results.<br>
Let's talk about 2018 on Slide 11. First, let's look at immediate impacts of changes in the tax law. Tax reform provides immediate benefits. It is<br>
allowing the additional $1 billion in incremental investment in 2018, much of that targeted for fiber deployment. The lower tax rate is also expected<br>
to increase operating cash flow by about $3 billion this year compared to pre-tax reform expectations.<br>
We're also confident that as other businesses increase investments, there will be a potential uplift in demand for our services. We can't predict<br>
exactly when so we didn't assume a significant increase in GDP trends in our guidance, but we are optimistic that it'll come and we'll be watching<br>
this closely.<br>
We expect our 2018 effective tax rate will be in the 23% range. The full year's impact of tax reform is expected to be about $0.45 of EPS help. FirstNet<br>
will have an impact on our 2018 financials. We plan to move quickly with the build-out and the timing of FirstNet reimbursements could impact<br>
our 2018 free cash flow.<br>
For example, we may have FirstNet-related expenditures this year that aren't reimbursed until 2019. We plan to net FirstNet reimbursements against<br>
the capital and operating expenditures to which they relate so there'll be no revenue impact. We estimate that 80% of the reimbursements will<br>
offset capital expenditures with 20% offsetting operating expenses. We expect to expense sustainability payments as paid, net of any recoveries<br>
for FirstNet-approved projects.<br>
We will see a $0.05 per share expense impact from our sustainability payments and other operating expenses from our build-out in FirstNet<br>
operations. Additionally, we will see a $0.05 a share expense impact from increased interest expense in 2018. This comes from placing our AWS<br>
and WCS spectrum in service and no longer capitalizing the carrying costs related to owning inactive spectrum. And we'll see a $0.04 a share<br>
expense increase from the lower expected return on pension assets that we previously discussed. In 2018, we will see a $0.06 a share benefit from<br>
reduced depreciation expense that will be generated by the copper abandonment that we recorded in the fourth quarter of '17.<br>
And finally, the new revenue recognition accounting standard will have a positive impact on our near-term financials. Several items will be impacted,<br>
but the biggest of these are deferral of commission expenses, which will increase profits in 2018; recharacterization of some service to equipment<br>
revenues for equipment that was provided with multiyear service contracts. This is expected to have an impact on service revenues, but not a<br>
material impact on total revenues or on profitability. And a netting of universal service and other regulatory fees against the related expense. This<br>
is expected to significantly reduce both revenues and expense, but have little impact on profits.<br>
We still have work to do on revenue recognition, but our initial estimate is $0.10 to $0.15 per share of positive EPS impact in 2018. Our results will<br>
differ from others because of our extensive Next program as well as our adoption of deferred installment accounting contemporaneous with our<br>
2015 acquisition of DTV. Look more -- look for more detailed disclosures in the near future.<br>
The impacts of tax reform, FirstNet, copper plant abandonment and rev rec are reflected in our 2018 outlook, and the details on our outlook are<br>
on Slide 12. On a stand-alone basis, excluding Time Warner, we expect adjusted EPS in the $3.50 range, as I said, inclusive of the items previously<br>
discussed. We also expect organic growth in the low single digits, driven by continued profitability improvement in Mexico, wireless service revenues<br>
growing in the second half of the year, cost structure benefits from virtualization and automation, and those offset by continued transformation<br>
of our video business and legacy services.<br>
Free cash flow growth will be strong. We're expecting about $21 billion of free cash flow for the full year, which approximates our expected adjusted<br>
net income. And we expect capital spending to approach $25 billion or about $23 billion net of expected FirstNet reimbursements. That includes<br>

JANUARY 31, 2018 / 9:30PM, T - Q4 2017 AT&amp;T Inc Earnings Call<br>
That's it in a nutshell. We ended the year with an exclamation point thanks to customer growth, tax reform and FirstNet. And we're very excited<br>
about the year ahead.<br>
With that, Mike, I will turn it back to you for Q&amp;A.<br>
Michael J. Viola - AT&amp;T Inc. - SVP of IR<br>
Thanks, John. Tony, we are ready for the questions.<br>
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS<br>
Operator<br>
(Operator Instructions) We'll take our first question from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.<br>
Philip A. Cusick - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division - MD and Senior Analyst<br>
John, that was a big nutshell. So if I can, one for John and one for Randall. First, John, have you talked to the rating agencies about what the<br>
appropriate long-term leverage target looks like during -- given the lower tax rate? And then, Randall, sort of following up on things that John said,<br>
and I know it's early, but what have you seen from customers in terms of investing in their telecom services post tax reform? Probably more<br>
conversations so far than orders, but how can that impact AT&amp;T trends going forward?<br>
John Joseph Stephens - AT&amp;T Inc. - Senior EVP &amp; CFO<br>
So Phil, thanks for that. And one clarification, Mike's in here with me, I want to make sure I said this right. We expect to get to more traditional<br>
historic levels by 2022 or earlier. I apologize if I said 2020. The correct number is 2022, which is consistent with the advice we've been giving every<br>
time we talk about the deal.<br>
Philip A. Cusick - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division - MD and Senior Analyst<br>
Makes a little more sense.<br>
John Joseph Stephens - AT&amp;T Inc. - Senior EVP &amp; CFO<br>
Phil, we have been in discussions with the rating agencies, but we don't -- we haven't come to any conclusions. We are still in a give-and-take in<br>
that process and we'll continue that. I will -- so I expect that this will impact their models. I also understand that they are also waiting for us to close<br>
the Time Warner deal and to update their models with the new Time Warner information. So no answer yet, working on it, and we look forward to<br>
kind of continue those conversations with the rating agencies.<br>
Randall L. Stephenson - AT&amp;T Inc. - Chairman, President &amp; CEO<br>
Yes, Phil, on the capital spending and investment, and you said specifically in telecom, but we track with this gross fixed investment. If you look at<br>
business gross fixed investment anywhere in the world, our services tend to track with that. Fourth quarter was like a number we hadn't seen in<br>
quite some time. Gross fixed investment, I think it was over 6%. It was a very, very strong number. We -- around here, we do high-fives when we<br>
see those kind of numbers because that's usually an indication of general spending. Because when businesses spend more capital, they generally<br>

hire more people. When they hire more people, they spend more capital. And so specifically, you'll see businesses adding people, and those people<br>
have to have computers. They have to have machinery. They have to have broadband connections. They have to have mobile services. They have<br>
to have data connectivity. And so that is a metric we watch closely.<br>
The anecdotal evidence, and it's purely anecdotal, other than the gross fixed investment, is strong. People are talking about investing more. You've<br>
seen announcement after announcement of companies saying they're intending to invest more capital as a result of tax reform. And so that is our<br>
expectation. I think history is a very good indicator of this. And when you talk about -- when you see Apple talking about investing in more facilities<br>
and manufacturing in the United States, for a company like AT&amp;T and anybody in our sector, that's a good thing. So we have pretty good expectations<br>
that the B2B side of our house, our enterprise business side, could catch some tailwinds. We don't have that built into the guidance we've given<br>
you because it's just too early right now, but I'm very optimistic that we are going to overachieve most economic assessments of 2018. You're finally<br>
starting to see some economists get out there and very bravely just talk about 2.7% growth. I think that is very low. And if we don't have a 3 handle<br>
on economic growth this year, I'll be sorely disappointed and surprised.<br>
Operator<br>
Our next question will come from Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays.<br>
Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays PLC, Research Division - Director and Senior Research Analyst<br>
I wanted to touch base a bit on the video industry at this point. How do you think about the status of the linear video market? It does seem as<br>
though one of your competitors seems to be taking a more selective or focused approach in terms of their subscribers. How should we think about<br>
your go-to-market strategy for that business going forward? And then, John, you had mentioned there's some ongoing pressures through this<br>
transition. How do you think about the margin profile of that business going forward? Clearly, you folks are investing in some of these next-generation<br>
products. Given that those are still subscale, but growing, but in investment mode for now, how should we think about the progression of returns<br>
in that business going forward?<br>
Randall L. Stephenson - AT&amp;T Inc. - Chairman, President &amp; CEO<br>
Okay, Amir, I'll go first. I'll talk a bit about the video industry and how we think about it. But since the day we bought DIRECTV, we assumed that<br>
traditional linear video would be in a declining mode, just kind of the nature of it. OTT and the ability to consume video on mobile devices, we<br>
believe, would be the trend and the wave of where things went. We wanted to be in the leadership position in facilitating that kind of consumption<br>
of premium video on mobile devices. And we have been in the leadership position in that. We have made it an objective to ensure that we can<br>
transition. We run these transitions all the time, right? When you have technology transitions or business model transitions, whether it's fixed phone<br>
service to mobile, whether it's a private line kind of service for business to VPN, whether it's -- you can kind of go down the list of -- whether it's<br>
feature phones to smartphones, we run these transitions and we think we're pretty good at them.<br>
As it relates to video, we are standing up a video product that we are convinced will give us growth in the video platform for the next few years.<br>
And that's our DIRECTV NOW. So as traditional linear declines, DIRECTV NOW, we think, can offset that. And not only that, but our traditional linear<br>
video will be repurposed. You heard me talk about a next-gen platform that is home-centric, a very thin client into the home. That will actually<br>
drive cost structure of the traditional video product down so that you can preserve margins in the traditional linear video as you grow in the<br>
over-the-top applications and video services. So we're very bullish on video. As we look at the numbers, our consumers are consuming more video<br>
than they used to, not less. They're consuming it on different devices. They're not just consuming it in their home. They're consuming it on tablets<br>
and smartphones. And that's where we want to be. And so we're rather bullish on that, Amir.<br>

JANUARY 31, 2018 / 9:30PM, T - Q4 2017 AT&amp;T Inc Earnings Call<br>
John Joseph Stephens - AT&amp;T Inc. - Senior EVP &amp; CFO<br>
Amir, with regard to legacy or the linear TV product, think about it this way. First of all, key strategy is the bundle. When we are bundling with<br>
wireless or when we're bundling with broadband, we're seeing significant improvement. We mentioned that we've got another 170,000 homes<br>
this quarter that we got bundled with wireless and another 700,000 wireless customers that were bundled with our satellite TV product. That<br>
bundling allows us to have profitability from that combined account. It also -- it creates higher value, lifetime value, for each of those customers.<br>
When you see us bundling with fiber, what we are seeing is a churn ratio rate that's about half the stand-alone satellite or video product churn. So<br>
as we expand the fiber to 14 million over the next 2 years, you'll see us have tremendous opportunities to bundle with video. So that is great. In<br>
addition, we expect to pick up whatever video losses we have and more than that with DIRECTV NOW. And Randall spoke -- just spoke about the<br>
aspects of that and the opportunity is to improve the revenues, profitability and the reach of that.<br>
And the last thing I'll tell you is that with regard to our satellite product, we're going to continue to serve what you might consider nonurban or<br>
nonsuburban America, rural America. We're always going to have an ability to do that on a combined basis with our great wireless service and with<br>
our satellite TV process -- products such that we can continue to provide those who live outside the city limits, so to speak, great quality and great<br>
choice. That's how we're thinking about the business. But as we've shown over the last 2.5 years, that's all based on a relentless obsession with cost<br>
management and continuing to improve the cost structure. And while the advertising opportunities are there for DTV NOW, they're clearly also<br>
there for our traditional linear TV product. So those are all the things we're working on. Is it going to be easy? It'll be challenging. But as Randall<br>
said, we've been through this kind of transition many times before, and we feel up to the task of working through it.<br>
Operator<br>
Our next question in queue will come from John Hodulik with UBS.<br>
Batya Levi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Executive Director and Research Analyst<br>
This is Batya Levi for John. Two questions. One, just following up on the bundling strategy, can you talk about how bundling has started to improve<br>
sub trends both on the video and the voice -- phone side? And if we can expect that to continue into '18? And how will you balance that sub growth<br>
with profitability? Do you expect wireless margins, which were kind of flattish this year, can they start to improve? And the entertainment profitability<br>
has been coming down, can we see a stop of that decline?<br>
John Joseph Stephens - AT&amp;T Inc. - Senior EVP &amp; CFO<br>
Yes. So Batya, it's good to hear from you. With regard to the impacts on -- of bundling on wireless churn, can't give you a number of basis points,<br>
a precision amount of basis points in there. What I can point to is, if you look at specifically postpaid phone, which is where the majority of our<br>
really value-focused bundling is done, we're getting record levels of low churn. And we attribute at least part of that to the bundling aspect. So<br>
what we're seeing is working. That's the first thing.<br>
Secondly, we're also seeing what was a very high level, 700,000 increase year-over-year, in smartphone gross adds and upgrades and a continued<br>
significant level of BYOD devices. So what we're seeing is, is with this bundling opportunity, customers are continuing to come back to us that have<br>
been with us for a while and new customers are coming to us. That's what resulted not only in the great subscriber gains for the quarter, but in<br>
some of that, if you will, impact on cost and margins. But when you look at the total profitability, we're very pleased with that. And when you look<br>
at the churn impacts of that for years to come, you can understand why we'd make that lifetime value investment. So that's how we're seeing that.<br>
With regard to the video product, we're seeing a similar -- once again, I can't point directly as a measurement for basis points. But as I mentioned<br>
specifically with fiber, it's cut in half on the bundling. But on wireless, we're also seeing lower churn. So that's being, if you will, very helpful to the<br>
overall business. But then when you put those multiple products together, and it's not only the reduction in service costs with regard to billing<br>
and administration and so on and so forth, but it's also with that total customer and the ability to track all our services, we do see a long-term path<br>
to greater value creation. That's how we're thinking about that bundling strategy, not on a day-to-day basis, but when you look at the -- for example,<br>

JANUARY 31, 2018 / 9:30PM, T - Q4 2017 AT&amp;T Inc Earnings Call<br>
if you look at churn on that longer-term basis, churn at these levels is implying 100-month and more lives for these smartphones; tremendous,<br>
tremendous opportunities. So that's what we're looking towards.<br>
Lastly, we're going to be able to continue to cut costs. And as we continue to cut costs through virtualization and automization, we're going to be<br>
able to continue to maintain. We have been on a path for the last 4 quarters of setting records in wireless service margins. And we chose this quarter<br>
to reinvest in our customer base. When you got churn at those sub-90 basis point levels, it seems like the right thing to do. And with tax reform<br>
and the other things that are going on in our business, we feel very comfortable that it is the right thing to do.<br>
Randall L. Stephenson - AT&amp;T Inc. - Chairman, President &amp; CEO<br>
I would -- I'd add to that, Batya, that there's probably no more powerful driver of margins in our industry than low churn. And when you think about<br>
what drives low churn, there are 2 big drivers. Customer sat is the #1 driver of low churn, but the second is multiproduct bundles with our customers.<br>
The more relationships they have with us on different products, the more powerful the driver of churn is. And so that's why we relentlessly focus<br>
on both of these. But the multiproduct services are the second-biggest driver of churn improvement that we have.<br>
Operator<br>
And our next question will come from David Barden with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.<br>
David William Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD<br>
I guess I'm that guy this quarter again. So John, just doing the math on kind of that long series of EPS adjustments kind of taking out the hurts and<br>
putting back the helps, it kind of gets to kind of low single-digit EPS growth, $2.98 to $3.03, from the $2.92 this year. And we're looking at...<br>
John Joseph Stephens - AT&amp;T Inc. - Senior EVP &amp; CFO<br>
So David, let me go through this. So low single digits, look, if you want to pick 1%, 2% or 3%, I'll let you do that, and $0.08 of those items that I<br>
talked about. When you add them altogether, those items total about $0.08 of net pressure. $0.06 of that is from depreciation, the other 3 were<br>
$0.14 of pressure, a net $0.08 of pressure that we're absorbing. So just to be straightforward with that.<br>
David William Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD<br>
Okay. Good. And -- but on a net basis, it still seems to suggest like something is still moderating from 2017. I think we saw about $1 billion of EBITDA<br>
pressure in '17. And I was wondering if you can kind of talk about into '18 kind of how that EBITDA versus non-EBITDA, below the line stuff, is getting<br>
you to that EPS number. And then the second piece of it is just, I mean, last quarter, I asked this about the enterprise business flattening out. You<br>
said that there was some green shoots emerging in the pricing environment. You've actually had a pretty stable enterprise wireline business for<br>
the whole year now. And with the CenturyLink-Level 3 merger kind of consolidating the space, is stable the new outlook or are we kind of turning<br>
a corner here?<br>
John Joseph Stephens - AT&amp;T Inc. - Senior EVP &amp; CFO<br>
Yes. So let me -- a couple of things with the enterprise business. We did not, as I mentioned on our guidance, set our basis for our guidance. We<br>
didn't assume a dramatic shift in the GDP. We certainly expect continued investment, as Randall mentioned. We expect that to turn into orders.<br>
We just didn't know when. And so we haven't modeled that in. With regard to the most recent activity, we did see -- through some management<br>
actions team took, we saw some improvement in our trends on our legacy revenues and some continued positive growth on our strategic services.<br>
If that continues and we can continue to push that through the year, along with some tax reform-initiated demand, we can -- there's an opportunity<br>

for us to do better than what we've modeled, better than what we've given in guidance. So we are hopeful and we're watching, and we're going<br>
to be -- but we're going to be careful with that.<br>
With regard to the items, David, with regard to 2018 in the operational side, improvements in Mexico, continued strong performance in Latin<br>
America, we'll continue to see some pressure from legacy revenues like wireline voice and then some early challenges with wireless service as we<br>
lap the first year of unlimited and then a movement towards voice service revenue improvement and growth. Those are the things that are going<br>
on in the business. One thing I will point out. Remember, $0.05 -- about $0.05 of the pressure for next year is going to be in interest expense. That's<br>
a below-the-line item. That's from no longer capitalizing the interest expense with regard to the spectrum we're going to put into service with<br>
FirstNet. That was part of that $0.08 that I was talking about. So while we're not giving specific guidance on margins or on EBITDA levels, I want to<br>
make sure I gave you as much color as I could to your question.<br>
David William Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD<br>
And just kind of takeaway, is the EBITDA kind of trajectory still pretty much in the same ZIP Code or are we seeing that improve, and that's kind of<br>
helping that EPS story?<br>
John Joseph Stephens - AT&amp;T Inc. - Senior EVP &amp; CFO<br>
Yes, I will say -- I'll just say it this way, you have to have good, solid performance in the business to overcome those pressures and to still come in<br>
that mid-single digits -- or excuse me, to come in, in that low single digits EPS growth. You have to have strong performance in the business. And<br>
the biggest item that is [on] that EBITDA that we -- or 2 big items that we talked about is one, depreciation, which we've laid out; and then two is<br>
the interest expense. Those go in large margin to offset each other.<br>
Randall L. Stephenson - AT&amp;T Inc. - Chairman, President &amp; CEO<br>
David, I'm probably on the optimistic side of business spending, as you heard my answer to Phil's question. But as you just kind of look at fourth<br>
quarter, up and down the business segment, it just -- it wasn't just concentrated in one area. It was -- multinationals all the way down to small<br>
business were just showing signs of improvement. And so I find myself getting somewhat optimistic that business spending is really going to<br>
accelerate as we work through 2018.<br>
Operator<br>
Our next question, that will come from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.<br>
Simon William Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD<br>
Randall, you touched a little bit on 5G and you put out a couple of press releases here, was obviously in the news the last couple of days. Can you<br>
just talk about where you are and what you've learned from the trials so far and what should we be looking to you and AT&amp;T for 2018 in 5G? What<br>
are the use cases that get you most excited? And then, John, just coming back to the ASC 606, the $0.10 to $0.15, I think Verizon had said that by<br>
2020 that would sort of wind down to kind of a neutral impact. Is that the same math for you?<br>
John Joseph Stephens - AT&amp;T Inc. - Senior EVP &amp; CFO<br>
Randall, let me take the ASC 606 first. Yes, over a period of years, it will balance out as the contracts lap each other. So yes, that's the kind of thought.<br>
And as I mentioned, the other item is with us in comparison to others, we did adopt deferred installment accounting that's commonly used in the<br>

cable industry. We adopted that with the DIRECTV merger. So a lot of the items along with our Next accounting that we've already been using will,<br>
to some people, give an impression that our numbers are not as much as they otherwise might have expected. Randall?<br>
Randall L. Stephenson - AT&amp;T Inc. - Chairman, President &amp; CEO<br>
On 5G, Simon, the use case I get most excited about is the opportunity to have nearly a nationwide broadband footprint and it could be a fixed-line<br>
replacement. The capacity is there. The performance is there. There's going to be full gigabit throughput. And so I get very energized on the<br>
opportunity over the next few years to actually build out a nationwide capability for broadband for both business as well as consumer. And so that<br>
-- and those are the ones, by the way, that from -- the technology is probably the easiest to scale and so forth. But as you begin to think about<br>
mobile solutions, we will be deploying mobile solutions in 2018. And it's going to be in 12 markets is what we'll be doing. Think of this as a puck.<br>
Because really, the thing that's going to cause 5G to go slow more than anything else is just availability of handsets. We're getting the equipment<br>
manufacturing moving. We're getting the supply chains moving. We're doing the cell site acquisition. We're doing all the build-type work. But<br>
getting the handsets at scale penetrated into the market will slow things down. So that's why we're going to be deploying pucks in the first part<br>
of our deployments in these 12 markets. So it is a mobile solution, but it's not going to be a handset because there's not going to be that many<br>
handsets available. We'll be pushing the vendors to make that happen faster. But we know how long these things take and how long it takes them<br>
to penetrate the market.<br>
As you think about other applications, the easy ones that we all talked about is autonomous cars. And in fact, I just don't think those use cases work<br>
without 5G technology. It's all about low latency. People say 5G and you're thinking about speed. And speed and throughput is important, but the<br>
most important element is latency and having low latency. 5G is the first technological innovation that truly gets us to low latency. And as we think<br>
about a distributed cloud environment, we think we're in a unique place to begin distributing the cloud capability into our infrastructure. Think of<br>
all the nodes, all the access points that we have in our network distributing cloud. At that level, we can take latency to a lower level than we think<br>
virtually anybody else, but it will be a competition. It will be a race. We'll see who gets there first. But the latency is exciting. The latency is also<br>
critical for -- as you think about super IoT, connected devices and connecting everything. It's going to be important for virtual reality and augmented<br>
reality applications. So we're taking this, to your point, use case by use case. And that is what's determining our deployment and our build plans,<br>
our use cases. And it's centered around predominantly these areas that I just articulated to you.<br>
Operator<br>
Our next question will come from Amy Yong with Macquarie.<br>
Amy Yong - Macquarie Research - Analyst<br>
And following up on the Entertainment Group, you exited 4Q with really solid video trends, do you still think you can grow the video pie and maybe<br>
perhaps even outpace the traditional pay-TV environment? And I think, previously you've updated us on the mix of DIRECTV NOW subscribers. Can<br>
you give us the mix of cord-cutters and where they're coming from? That'd be helpful.<br>
John Joseph Stephens - AT&amp;T Inc. - Senior EVP &amp; CFO<br>
So a couple of things. We would expect to continue to grow video customers with our DIRECTV NOW outpacing our linear customer counts in the<br>
sense of net additions. So we do expect that. Secondly, I would suggest to you that the mix hasn't changed much. We're still getting around 50%<br>
of them from cord-nevers and around 50% of cord-cutters or cord-shavers. Secondly, we are getting a disproportionate amount of those customers<br>
being multiple dwelling units, millennials and others, well, specifically those 2 groups. And we're excited about that. So as we move through the<br>
process we'll continue. We still haven't seen a dramatic uptick in customers that are shifting from our full value product to the DTV NOW, but we<br>
continue to watch that carefully and continue to come up with different ways to make sure we can prove that out and track that. But in kind of a<br>
total video customer base, we do believe we have the opportunity to continue to grow just like we did in the fourth quarter.<br>

Randall L. Stephenson - AT&amp;T Inc. - Chairman, President &amp; CEO<br>
Exactly our plan, Amy. We'll grow our TV customer base is the expectation. And as we continue to mature the DIRECTV NOW platform, we think<br>
we can actually do better. The new DIRECTV NOW platform has a lot more functionality. So once you get cloud-based DVRs and you can put a third<br>
stream, now all of a sudden you're entering a new marketplace with those as well and getting new functionality. We think we get higher penetration.<br>
So we're actually very bullish on DIRECTV NOW. And we think that -- we're convinced the economics will continue to improve as we move over the<br>
next couple of years.<br>

One on capital allocation. I just -- with the significant cash savings you're laying out from tax reform, are there any areas of the business you're<br>
looking to potentially accelerate investment in beyond fiber? And on the fiber topic, does this change at all how you think about that 14 million<br>
fiber homes passed target beyond mid-2019?<br>
Randall L. Stephenson - AT&amp;T Inc. - Chairman, President &amp; CEO<br>
Yes. I got to -- look, tax reform changes everything as it relates to capital allocation, Matthew, and you probably understand that as well as anybody.<br>
But when you're suddenly looking at your after-tax returns improving by 20% roughly, it just changes how you think about your investment theses.<br>
It changes the profitability equation on fiber as well as 5G and how you think about rural and how you think about FirstNet. And so it gives us the<br>
ability to consider starting to push our fiber deployments faster and further. And it's early. It's hard to say what it will mean as you own a media<br>
and entertainment company. But how does it affect the decision-making as it relates to investment in premium content, as it relates to<br>
direct-to-consumer distribution and how fast you go in those regards. So it's -- we've been planning for this for quite some time. But now that it's<br>
here and it's real, we're going through and we're digging in and asking, what are these projects that we want to be investing in and these initiatives<br>
we want to be investing in that can continue to drive growth over the next 5 or 6 years and let's take advantage of it.<br>
John Joseph Stephens - AT&amp;T Inc. - Senior EVP &amp; CFO<br>
Matt, we are expecting to spend more money on fiber to accelerate the process and achieve our goals and then to look -- then we'll have the<br>
opportunity and look to expand. Secondly, we are, if you will, excited about and I think the team is working very, very hard to achieve the FirstNet<br>
goals and even exceed the goals set out by the FirstNet Authority. That's a really positive thing for us. And while we were interested in doing that<br>
for some time, tax reform and the cash generate -- the cash savings aspect of that provide us that opportunity -- provide the flexibility to go after<br>
that even more. So those are 2 areas where, I think, you'll really see us utilize the benefits of the new tax laws.<br>
Operator<br>
That will come from Scott Goldman with Jefferies.<br>
Scott Goldman - Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst<br>
Maybe, Randall, if you can just talk a little about the wireless competitive environment. Obviously, still very competitive, but it seems like we've<br>
been operating in a pretty -- in a more rational environment of late, and that's driven some better results in fourth quarter. Just wondering how<br>

JANUARY 31, 2018 / 9:30PM, T - Q4 2017 AT&amp;T Inc Earnings Call<br>
you think about, overall, what you're embedding in your outlook in terms of the competition in 2018. And maybe just a quick one, follow-up with<br>
John on that same question. How do you think about the puts and takes on ARPU based on the expectations for competition in 2018?<br>
Randall L. Stephenson - AT&amp;T Inc. - Chairman, President &amp; CEO<br>
You bet. My outlook for wireless competition is that it will continue to be intensely competitive. And we don't see that changing. How people are<br>
competing has changed somewhat. And how we're competing is changing quite a bit. I'm not going to go into a lot of details because we're -- we<br>
made some moves in the fourth quarter, and you're going to see those continue into the first, second and third quarter. We think they're going to<br>
be very effective and have been very effective in the marketplace. But I'll call it smarter competition, smarter way of approaching our customer<br>
base and in accessing new customers. We believe very strongly that combining video with our mobile product is a really important element. And<br>
you will see us continue to do that, but actually probably take it to new and different levels because it's proving so powerful in churn. We're also<br>
getting to a place and we've learned enough that it's becoming very powerful as it relates to customer acquisition. And so combining video with<br>
wireless is a really important driver. And you've seen some of the industry begin to make moves to mimic that, which is usually an indication that<br>
you're having success. And so you'll see more and more of that. But it will remain competitive. But we feel really good about how we're set up,<br>
what we're doing in the marketplace and that we'll continue to even take that a step further as we move through 2018.<br>
John Joseph Stephens - AT&amp;T Inc. - Senior EVP &amp; CFO<br>
Scott, on the ARPU side, let me first make sure we're clear. With regard to rev rec and the adoption of it, and it's an unusual accounting change in<br>
that it's a flash cut. So one of the -- a couple of the changes include regulatory fees, USF, which we count as service revenue today. And then also<br>
in the expense line, they'll be netted. So ARPU will come because we'll be pulling that out. And then secondly, there'll be some of the service revenue<br>
-- that's called service revenue today will get allocated to equipment revenues in the future for that small number of situations where we still<br>
subsidize equipment. Once you take that into account, you will have comparable ARPU. And I just want to make sure everybody knows that.<br>
With regard to the opportunities for ARPU, I think about it in a total profitability situation, not just in an ARPU situation. So we certainly are looking<br>
to do as strong as we can on ARPU and add as many services. But as Randall said at the beginning, we're relentless on this lowest cost per megabit<br>
provider. And as we get to that, we can be very successful with things like prepaid for other alternative levels of ARPU. My only point is, is that while<br>
we bundle with regard to video and broadband and wireless together and we get great ARPUs from those, there will be situations where we will<br>
look to accept lower ARPUs, like in prepaid. And because of a very low cost structure, because of no billing or general administrative cost, because<br>
of opportunities to maybe get data analytics value out of it, we'll be able to still be profitable or we'll be able to expand the base of customers and<br>
be able to make more total profit that way. So that's one of the reasons why we're not giving EBITDA margin guidance is because we want to focus<br>
on this total cash and total profitability position. So while ARPUs will continue to be measured relentlessly and we'll continue to analyze them in<br>
the same way, I want you to understand that we're really focused on that total service revenue growth, total revenue growth, total profitability as<br>
opposed to just any one aspect.<br>
Randall L. Stephenson - AT&amp;T Inc. - Chairman, President &amp; CEO<br>
Very good, thank you, Scott. And listen, I want to thank everybody for joining us today. 2017 was a truly unique year for American business, U.S.<br>
business. And I think 2018 is going to prove to be a really good year for the realization of the implications of what was done in 2017. And I think<br>
the consumer is going to be better off. I think wages are going to be higher as businesses invest more. And as a result, AT&amp;T being a very U.S.-centric<br>
company, we think we're going to have a good year ahead of us as well. So again, thank you for joining us and look forward to talking to you next<br>
time.<br>
Operator<br>
Thank you very much. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference call for today. We do thank you for your participation and for<br>
using AT&amp;T's Executive TeleConference. You may now disconnect.<br>
