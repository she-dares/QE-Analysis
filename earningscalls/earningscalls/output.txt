My name is Dennis, and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today, January 18<sup>th</sup>, 2017.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you. Mr. Holmes, you may begin your conference.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Dane Holmes</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. And welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm's belief regarding future events that, by their nature are uncertain and outside of the firm's control. The firm's actual results and financial condition may differ possibly materially from what is indicated in these forward-looking statements.

Harvey?</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thanks Dane and thanks to everyone for dialing in. As many of you are aware, Marty will be assuming my position in April. As you would expect, we\u2019re already working side by side to ensure a smooth transition in the coming months.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Over his career, Mary held positions of increasing responsibility in investment banking, institutional client services and then most recently as our Chief Information Officer. During that time, Marty established a track record of creating tremendous value for both our clients and our firm. Having worked closely with him for over a decade, I have full confidence that Marty will continue that track record as our Chief Financial Officer.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">With that Marty would like to make a few comments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Martin Chavez</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thanks Harvey. Just a few brief words from me. I have really enjoyed the opportunity to meet many of you in my prior role as CIO. I look forward to building upon existing relationships and building new ones in the months and years ahead. I have always found our conversations to be extremely insightful and valuable to effectively managing our firm. Goldman Sachs has a long tradition vigilantly focusing on risk management, operational excellence and maintaining a conservative financial profile. In my new role, I have every intention of continuing that focus and tradition.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">With that I will turn it back to Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Thanks Marty. Okay, now let\u2019s walk through the fourth quarter and full year results then Marty and I are happy to answer any questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Briefly on the fourth quarter; net revenues were $8.2 billion, net earnings were $2.3 billion, earnings per diluted share were $5.08 and annualized return on common equity was 11.4%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">With respect to our annual results, we had firm-wide net revenues of $30.6 billion, net earnings of $7.4 billion, earnings per diluted share of $16.29 and a return on common equity of 9.4%. We grew book value per share by 6.7% year-over-year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">When reviewing 2016, it\u2019s helpful to contrast the performance between the first half of the year and the second half. The year began with a number of challenges but ultimately ended with a lot of positive momentum.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">For example, the start of the year which has historically been a period of high activity, which instead impacted by significant concerns regarding the economic outlook, equity markets posted substantial declines and credit spreads wide and materially at the start of the year. This combination of factors translated into a difficult operating environment for our clients and by extension for our firm.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In the second quarter concerns regarding global economic growth moderated but other concerns including the potential implications of the Brexit vote surface. Ultimately, net revenues in the first half of the year declined by 28% year-over-year with a vast majority of that declining occurring in the first quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Switching to the back half of the year, the global economic outlook improved reflecting solid economic reports particularly in the U.S. The prospect of diverging monitory policy and more pro-growth policies in the United States drove both activity levels and asset prices higher.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">For example various fixed income market volumes in the second half of 2016 rose double digits year-over-year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">U.S. investment grade credit spreads tightened by nearly 40 basis points. U.S. high yield spreads tightened by over 150 basis points. And the MSCI World index climbs 6% during the period.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Ultimately this drove improved client sentiment and better environments. As a result, net revenues in the back half of the 2016 increased by nearly 16% year-over-year and included two consecutive quarter of 11 plus percent returns on equity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In short, we ended the year with positive momentum and a significantly improved operating environment. With that as a back ground, let\u2019s discuss the individual business using greater detail.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">As it relates to the quarter, investment banking produced net revenues $1.5 billion, 3% lower than the third quarter. A pick up in M&amp;A was more than offset by a decline in underwriting. For the full year investment banking net revenues were $6.3 billion, down a 11% from 2015 and a decrease in equity underwriting and financial advisory revenues, which was partially by record debt underwriting revenues of $2.5 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Our franchise remains very well positioned. We ended the year as a leader in global announced and completed M&amp;A and as a leading equity and debt underwriter globally.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Breaking down the components of investment banking in the fourth quarter, advisory revenues were $709 million. The 8% improvement relative to the third quarter reflects an increase in a number of completed M&amp;A transactions. We advise on a number of significant transactions that closed during the fourth quarter including Procter &amp; Gamble, $12.5 billion merger with beauty business into Coty. Fortis Inc\u2019s $11.8 billion acquisition of ITC Holdings Corp. And Rackspace Hosting\u2019s $4.3 billion sales were of Apollo.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We also advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the fourth quarter including Qualcomm\u2019s $47 billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors, B/E Aerospace\u2019s $8.3 billion sales for Rockwell Collins and Capsugel\u2019s $5.5 billion sales for Lonza Group.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Moving to underwriting, net revenues were $777 million in the fourth quarter down 12% sequentially as debt and equity issuance slowed. Equity underwriting net revenues up $212 million were down 7% compared to the third quarter as follow-on offerings decreased.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Debt underwriting net revenues decreased 13% to $565 million from robust issuance levels in the third quarter. During the fourth quarter, we actively supported our clients' financing needs, participating in energies \u20ac4.6 billion IPO to Soros $1.6 billion high yield bond offering and it seems [indiscernible] $1.2 billion IPO. Our investment banking backlog improved from the third quarter, it was lower compared with very strong level at the end of 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our FICC and equities businesses, net revenues were $3.6 billion in the fourth quarter down slightly compared to the third quarter. For the full year $14.5 billion of net revenues were down modestly compared to 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">FICC client execution net revenues were $2 billion in the fourth quarter, up slightly quarter-over-quarter as many businesses benefited from increased client activity. This more than offset typical year end seasonality.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Commodities increased significantly during the quarter as higher energy prices drove better market making conditions and more client activity. Currencies were higher compared to the third quarter increasing client activity. Rates were down slightly relative to the third quarter, client activity was solid driven by diverging monetary policies. Credit and mortgages decreased in an environment that included lesser issuance and generally tighter spreads.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">For the full year, FICC client execution net revenues were $7.6 billion. This translated into a 6% increase year-over-year excluding DVA gains from 2015 results, given the difficult market conditions in the first quarter of 2016, 6% growth particularly notable. In equities, which include equities client execution, commissions and fees and security services, net revenues for the fourth quarter were $1.6 billion down 11% sequentially. Equities client execution net revenues were $459 million, down significantly across both derivatives and cash products.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Commissions and fees were $736 million, up slightly relative to the third quarter as global client volumes increased modestly. Security services generated net revenues of $398 million, up modestly on a sequential basis</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">For the full year, equities produce net revenues of $6.9 billion down 12% year-over-year. In 2016, we were impacted by less favorable market conditions and lower client activity and equities client execution. This compared to a relatively robust performance in the first half of 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to risk, average daily VaR in the fourth quarter was $61 million up from $57 million in the third quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Moving on to our investing and lending activities, collectively these businesses produced net revenues of $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter. Equity security generated net revenues of $1 billion, reflecting corporate performance as well as sales and gains in public equity investments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $457 million which was largely driven by net interest income of roughly $300 million. For the full year, investing and lending generated net revenues of $4.1 billion driven by $2.6 billion in gains from equity securities and $1.5 billion of net revenues from debt securities and loans. Our net interest income within debt securities was more than $1 billion for the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In investment management, we reported fourth quarter net revenues of $1.6 billion. This is up 8% from the third quarter primarily as a result of $224 million in incentive fees largely from alternative investment products. For 2016, investment management net revenues were $5.8 billion, down 7% year-over-year largely due to lower incentive fees. For the fourth quarter assets under supervision finished at a record $1.38 trillion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">The $32 billion increase versus the third quarter was driven by $17 billion of long term net inflows, $31 billion of net inflows into liquidity products, partially offset by $16 billion of market depreciation. On a full year basis, we had $42 billion of long term net inflows primarily driven by fixed income and $52 billion of liquidity product inflows.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as benefits was down 8% for 2016 reflecting the decline in net revenues. This translated into compensation in net revenues ratio of 38.1%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Fourth quarter non-competition expenses were $2.3 billion. The quarter included a $114 million donation to Goldman Sachs gives our donor advised charitable fund. For the full year non-compensation expenses were down significantly due to a decrease in provisions for litigation and regulatory matters. Excluding litigation provisions, non-competition expenses would have been down slightly year-over-year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Now I'd like to take you through a few key statistics for the end of the year. Total staff was approximately 34,400, down slightly from the third quarter. Our effective tax rate for the year was 28.2%. Our global core liquid asset ended the fourth quarter at $226 billion and our balance sheet was $862 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.5% using the standardized approach. It was 13.1% under the Basel III Advanced approach. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 6.4%. Our prudent approach to capital management is demonstrated by the strength of our capital ratios and had supported our return of excess capital to shareholders. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 7.6 million shares of common stock for $1.5 billion. For the full year, we repurchased $6.1 billion at an average purchase price of roughly $166 per share.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As a result, we reduced our basic share count by approximately 27 million shares for the year reaching a new record low. In addition, we paid out approximately $1.1 billion dollars of common dividends over the course of the year. In total, we returned $7.2 billion of capital to shareholders in 2016.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Before taking questions, a few closing thoughts. As we've said many times before, we have a healthy respect for the dynamic nature of our industry and we have an established track record of being responsive to changes in operating environment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As we discussed, the first half of 2016 was challenging. In response, we undertook and completed a $700 million expense initiative in the first half of the year. We continued those efforts in the second half of the year and ultimately generated nearly $900 million of run rate savings. When undertaking any expense initiative all about finding the right balance, you want to protect near term results without impacting long term prospects.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We believe we found the right balance in 2016. This can be seen in our ability to effectively serve our clients as activity picked up in the second half of the year. It also reflected in our continued investment in technology and infrastructure including our launch of Marcus.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Most importantly our expense discipline and the strength of our client relationships leaves as well positioned to deliver significant operating leverage to our shareholders in a better operating environment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In summary, we entered 2017 from a position of strength. We have a robust financial profile ending the year with $226 billion in liquidity more than a quarter of our balance sheet. All of our risk based capital ratios are well in excess of regulatory requirements well our share count sits at a record low. Importantly, this means we have the flexibility to navigate shifts in the operating environment including the positive scenario where we experienced a significant increase in client activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Finally, our global franchise remains as strong as ever reflecting our commitment and investment to serve our clients. Meeting their core objectives, we\u2019ll continue to be the basis for our long term success.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Thank you again for dialing in. Marty and I are happy to answer your questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p5\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Hi thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Hey good morning, Glenn.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Good morning. So I have a fixed income related question. Back in the first quarter of 2015, the Swiss re-pegged and things went bonkers for a couple weeks and you guys made a ton more money but then things die down for like six quarters. This quarter, we obviously had the election and a couple other events and things went bonkers, but it feels very different to me and more permanent and client needs are changing and we have monetary policy diversion, so I'm leaving the witness here, but does it feel different to you guys and does that equate to this could be the first year in many that the fixed income fee pull could grow?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Yeah you know it's a great question. I mean the quarter you're reflecting on obviously the first quarter of 2015 very strong quarter for us, we had nearly a 15% ROE. That was the quarter as you point out, there were monetary policy announcements and I think there was a little bit of a relief activity there because that was viewed as increased monetary policy QE and that was a trend now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">As we all saw over a period of time that ultimately led more to concerns about lackluster growth and it led to concerns about deflation and then it led to concerns ultimately that actually QE policies at the limit may not be effective and may actually present risks. I would say you could look at our fourth quarter, but I think it\u2019d be better to look really at the second half of the year and what we saw from clients in the second half of the year was basically a build of confidence and expectation that we might see stronger fiscal policy, divergence of interest rates that we weren't heading into a deflationary cycle more confidence about economic growth, and so I would say there was increased optimism around the world.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Now those are the kind of things that always drive our business, our clients are very sensitive to that it changes sentiment. So I would say that that felt more like a trend across the past six months of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Okay, maybe some of yours ex-colleagues consensus more tweets and increased activity levels, kidding. Let last question on INL. I - we got - it's good to have that reprieve in terms of the INL funded divestments. I'm curious if it changes at all how you approach the way we asked you every quarter about what's left in equity, what do you need to divest, and that whole game plan I\u2019m curious on your thoughts there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">No, so I\u2019m happy to walk you through it. So I mean in order flow I walk you through every quarter, longer cover fund $106.7 billion you take out an amount that confirms that's $200 million that leaves you with $6.5 billion. Of the $6.5 billion, $1.8 billion of that is inner fund but those entities are already public, they're trading publicly on exchanges. So they are already liquid, they are just in a process of being sold down. So now with respect to Volcker as was more that's expected by the marketplace because you remember under the original construct of Volcker, it was never designed to force sales, it was obviously very encouraging of compliance. So there was an expectation everyone would do what they could save to comply. But again there was no there's no desire for fire sales and so the expectation here is that we've now submitted for the extensions, we'll go through the extension process, but we've been a good say that during if you read their communication, you expect extensions to be approved broadly across the industry.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">For us, it hasn't changed the approach of the business. It's always been about ensuring that we provide the best returns for our clients because as you know, we're invested alongside our clients in these funds. Apply more than you wanted, but I just try to cover the whole thing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">I appreciated, thank you. Go ahead we can go on to the next person. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">All right, thanks Glenn.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">The next question is from line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Good morning, Harvey. And then welcome on board Marty. So hate to nit-pick in a strong quarter, but performance in equities was noticeably weaker than peers. I\u2019m curious if there were any onetime items in the quarter or anything that you think drove underperformance, and then maybe more broadly if you could update us on how you're feeling about the competitive position in that business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So look I think you're right to point out it wasn't our strongest quarter. I mean in terms of the franchise, we feel great about the franchise at this stage and certainly we feel quite good about the competitive dynamic. No matter how you look at the business, whether you look at it as our global footprint, prime services, our ability to make capital our position underwriting, we feel incredibly good about it. Quarter-to-quarter there were always going to be one offs, there are a handful of things that we\u2019re less than probably this quarter, but I wouldn't read anything into it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay. And then as soon as your last one, I'll give you a pretty one accounting question here, but the accounting standards for the tax impact of shared based compensation, I believe this schedule to change this year. I'm giving share based comp is a meaningful part of the income statement curious if that has any impact on your kind of forward the way your incomes may looks going forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Yeah, so it's a very detailed question. It's great that you're asking it actually. So as everyone not might not be as aware as you are Christian but under a gap change, basically the change requires us to recognize the tax impact of the difference and the value of shares that we grant which a grant date versus delivery date and our tax expense line on the income statements. Now prior to the change that would happen and shows equity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So there is two observations here, so at best we can estimate it today, it could be in a range of $400 million, $500 million in terms of a reduction in the tax rates, but this is just a geographic realignment under gap, this has no impact to capital where the strength of our capital, but you will see a shift in the recognition. And obviously anyone can feel free to follow up more with Dane if you really want to get into the details of the gap stuff.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay, it's very helpful. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Mike, you there? Michael, you there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Michael, check your line to see if you\u2019re on mute. One moment. Michael, are you there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Yeah, can you hear me?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Yeah, we can hear you now Michael, but we couldn\u2019t hear you before, so the asked question we didn\u2019t get it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay, no problem. Thanks a lot. First one just on expenses, so you guys have been doing a very good job on controlling the expenses and we saw the operating leverage in the quarter. Just wanted to get a sense depending on what potential changes happened with policy and regulation, is there some way to give us some context on the amount that has been spent whether it's on regulation, compliance, technology it maybe since 2011, 2012 that could either shift around depending on the outlook, obviously there\u2019s a lot of core and that\u2019s going to stay in place, but just wanted to get a sense on what that increase has been despite you guys imaging the overall expense base well?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Yeah. Difficult to quantify that for you obviously it's been a huge investment in terms of risk, technology, compliance and we continue invest. I think the thing that we've been able to do is as we've invested and as we\u2019ve comply with the rules, we never be use technology and training across the teams to be as efficient as possible which is why this year you would have seen that non-compensation expense was the lowest expense since 2007 and we were able to also execute the $900 million run rate savings, but who knows where we\u2019ll end up in terms of the rule set, but obviously we\u2019ll always look to comply and comply in the most efficient way possible over time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay, and then just as a follow-up. It's been a while since we've been in an environment or people may more positive on like the growth outlook, and just wanted to get a sense and this is somewhat Glenn's question and you answer it, but maybe broader on trading and banking. What do you guys look at in terms of seeing that pick up in client engagement, I know you mentioned the IB pipeline is up quarter-over-quarter but even on trading in terms of balances, investment management maybe inflows, just wanted to get some sense on how we can kind of see the follow through or the impact of better economy in that translating into in a stronger revenues?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Yeah, that\u2019s a great question. Look the thing that informs us the most is the work that all of our people do whether they are in banking, asset management, whether they are in equities or fixed income all around the globe engage with their clients every day. So these are relationship that build up over decades, they are invested in over decades, you know our teams of sitting with CEOs, they are sitting in board rooms. And the best way for us to get a pause on that globally is the feedback we get from clients every day.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And as you know over the past several years there\u2019s been a general sense of concern with respect to global growth that was reinforced by a lot of the monitory policy around the world. And so I would say as we come into 2017, activity levels are quite high. You know we can\u2019t - we\u2019ve come out of a very low volume, low volatility environment for a number of years. We\u2019re happy to see how this year progresses. But with the shipping policies around the globe, it\u2019s an extraordinary catalyst for client dialog, for decision making and for content and that\u2019s really where as a firm that\u2019s where we really want to drive value and drive value with content.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay, thanks a lot.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Good morning. Just give us some of the increased optimism that you\u2019ve talked about on this call and the pipelines, just kind of big picture, how do you think differently about staffs, call it how much you lean forward versus trying to optimize, it\u2019s like a last several years you and the industry have been focused on optimizing to kind of lower pool of revenues got for regulatory environment. And just how do you think about you know it\u2019s not going to be a complete 180 going to maybe been aggressive, but how do you think maybe about leaning forward a little bit more, whereas the too loaded think that way?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Yeah. So look, this is all - this is all just about balance. So we are in a cyclical business within a pro-cyclical industry. And so as we make decisions about investing and controlling expenses, you know these things are mutually exclusive. So if you just look at the past year, obviously we responded very quickly to the tough first quarter. As I mentioned we finished with $900 million of run rate savings completed in the year. But at the same time, we never stop hiring. We launched Marcus. We acquired the digital lending platform. And so we stayed very front footed and we feel well positioned.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Now to the extent to which there were more demands on the firm by creating efficiencies to this part of the cycle, it gives us the flexibility to invest in an improved part of the cycle. That\u2019s the best thing about having capital ratios as strong as our capital ratios are right now are having liquidity levels where they are because to extent to which there is demand, we can respond to it. So you can be well positioned and you can be efficient at the same time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay, thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thanks Matt.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hi.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hey, good morning, Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">This is the first change since the announcement about Gary Cohn, so you know Harvey, how do you kind of approach your new position and then for Marty, how does your past experience you know help you or maybe present a challenge for you in the CFO role going from CIO to CFO is somewhat unique?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Right so - well obviously we\u2019re all going to miss Gary. It\u2019s fantastic that he is willing to contribute all of his experience to a country and it\u2019s a long tradition of senior leaders that Goldman Sachs doing that. So we\u2019re - again we\u2019re all going to miss Gary but we\u2019re all quite proud on what he is decided to do.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">In terms of the transition in my role, I\u2019ve obviously been CFO for a bit over four years. You David Solomon and I, we\u2019ve been on management for years. We found the same floor for years and you know which have affinities based on our experience. David spent more time in investment banking. I\u2019ve spent more time in institutional client services. But I think it lays out pretty easily actually in terms of how he and I will work across the firm. It\u2019s big place with lots of clients. So we\u2019re both pretty excited about it. And that transition is already underway.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">In terms of the transition with Marty, we\u2019ve already been working side by side. Marty has been shadowing me for a couple of weeks and then he is working on his transition. For those you met Marty, I don\u2019t know he about 150 pounds less than I am. So following my shadows sounds like a strange thing. But that\u2019s how we are approaching. And we got - and look we have a deep bench Mike, so we\u2019ve done these things across the firm for years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And can we hare - I mean Mary you are ready to talk?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Chavez</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Sure Mike. I\u2019ll just add, going to continue to firm\u2019s traditions and risk management and maintaining funding profile fortune to inherent such a talented team. And in keeping with the times and industry, applied maths and software to these problems or risk management but continue to do, we\u2019ve always done.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And just one last follow-up for you Marty, so coming from CIO, is that what it\u2019s about applying maths and software and how else can you apply your part experience to the new role?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Chavez</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Well, there is maths and software and everything that we do and so that\u2019s just a perspective - particular prospectively but really it\u2019s risk management. And that\u2019s what I\u2019ll keep doing as I\u2019ve always done, been let the firm for a long time, worked in many of our businesses always with an emphasis on risk.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Alright, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Chavez</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thanks Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hi, good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hey, good morning, Betsy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I wanted to ask a little bit about for productivity inset, we\u2019ve had conversations in the past where when we are in a world or at least what we\u2019ve discussed is in a rising rate with an established trend you know upside rate environment. In the past you\u2019ve had improving our productivity and I am wondering how you think about that, at this stage do you feel like you\u2019ve captured what you think you would capture overtime you know step function 4Q versus 3Q or is there more to go here?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Well I think it\u2019s difficult to me forecast. I would say the following I think if rates continue to rise and it\u2019s a reflection of optimism and concerns around deflation abate and concerns around economic decline debate and they are replaced with expectations of economic growth and activity and confidence and client sentiment continues to shift. I think there is meaningful upside in terms of the activity levels we could see in fixed income. So we\u2019ve been pretty optimistic now. We\u2019re positioned for a number of scenarios obviously given all the steps we\u2019ve taken over the years. And whether it\u2019s risk or capital, obviously we have a lot of capacity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And then secondly on INL, in the equity\u2019s line even I saw 2Q, 1Q obviously the market overall was up a little bit, certain factors up significantly and I had thought that your focus in many of the activities you have is a bit more of an industrial versus a services angle. So I am wondering if there is some - could you give us some color as to on the INL equity side how much of that was realized versus just a mark and what you still have left in the bag for realizations going forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yeah, so one thing I really want to point out because I know this question comes up about realizing and better you ask it but everybody asked it realize versus mark. The most important thing is the portfolio was always mark-to-market. So I think what you mean by realize is monetization activity. Obviously in the past year, monetization activity wouldn\u2019t have been as high necessarily as in prior years. We don\u2019t talk to it that way as much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">You know the INO balance sheet, you didn\u2019t ask it but the INO balance sheet is roughly $98 billion and nearly 80% of it is lending related activity. And so it\u2019s $21 billion what we call equity. But it\u2019s idiosyncratic and what you generally see over a period of time is a portfolio has outperformed markets because of the quality of the investment professionals and asset selections. But I wouldn\u2019t say necessarily that it\u2019s one category or another. I think you are right to say that obviously industrials are representative but it\u2019s very idiosyncratic and a year like this where equity issuance is down. You wouldn\u2019t expect to see lots of monetization.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. And then last on fees and asset management you know across the industry been some chatter on see pressure seeing some industry leaders cut season more of the passive oriented products but maybe you could just give us a senses to how you are thinking about that business and managing it for the several years?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So I think as a management for us among other things also a bright spot. As you saw assets under supervision finish at a record was up 10% for the year. I think we benefit from a number of things, I think we benefit from a fact we have a very unique well franchise. Obviously it was a mix of strong flows underneath that 10% rise. And this reflects a couple of things, obviously the performance we\u2019ve delivered to the clients but I do think it\u2019s the nature of the capabilities that have built over a number of years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So I think so far if you look at as in terms of asset flows, we\u2019re a bit of an outlier. We benefit from scale to your point of fees because we\u2019re certainly not immune to the general shipped in lower fees across the industry whether it\u2019s conventional pure competitor or competitive that\u2019s only dedicated to the asset management space, we are immune to that, but we benefit from having scale in our operation have been near $1.4 trillion on assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Great, now I am wondering on the fee rate side is here a bit of uniqueness you have in the high network client relationship versus institutional \u2026?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">No, I think we have strengthened both client segments but our fees are obviously competitive with the rest of the world.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay, I appreciate it. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Good morning, Harvey; Marty, welcome to the party.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Chavez</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So quick question, I know it\u2019s been touched on a couple of times, but it\u2019s one that\u2019s definitely I think front of investor\u2019s minds here, so hopefully you don\u2019t mind me touch it on it again. And you spoke a little bit of it Harvey with shifting policies globally, we need a better dialog which certainly is positive. But when we think about is especially in the U.S. seen down administration and the themes of the potential for reduced regulation and taxes seems like it could have both a first and second derivative impact on Goldman and so not only the direct impact of you but the clients and clients feeling better and improvement risk apatite. So how do you think about that opportunity assuming that plays out, is there a particular way in which investors should think about that opportunity and is there any historical context or other periods that you think are particularly relevant or helpful and trying to consider that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Well I guess I\u2019d say a few things. I think when you say indirect and direct you mean direct obviously we\u2019ve been relatively high tax payer and so tax rates come down. We\u2019re a beneficiary but obviously changes in tax policy can be a huge catalyst for how all of our clients think about deploying their capital strategic decisions and so that\u2019s board room dialog which obviously we\u2019re always front and center to. So I think that\u2019s what you meant by direct and indirect. So I would agree with that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I think it\u2019s very difficult to quantify just like it was difficult to quantify in 2012, 2013, 2014 how concerns around deflation and low economic growth will impact activity in a number of businesses. I think it\u2019s very difficult to quantify how increased optimism. You know we like to say in some respects, confidence is the best stimulus. And the extent to which we enter a period of increased confidence with respect to economic growth, physical policy, you mentioned tax policy, I think there could be a lot that happens. Now we\u2019ll have to see all these policies of ours. But who knows we could be at the beginning of a long term trend, we may not be. Again it was difficult to predict things in 2012 and how they will be in 2013, 2014 and 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yeah, now that\u2019s fair Harvey and yeah that was exactly what I was pointing on not only direct impact on you but the clients and the optimism. So okay, that\u2019s helpful. You\u2019ve touched also on the operating leverage, so maybe I want to hit on that a bit. It seems like up taking comp ratio in \u201816 was probably more of a revenue story, so want to confirm that\u2019s true and then when we think about maybe the other side of that blade or the other blade of that knife if we start to see revenue environment improve, how should we think about operating leverage at Goldman given all of the work that you\u2019ve done on the expense front which you\u2019ve talked about a couple of times?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Well, I appreciate you are recognizing the work. Obviously over the last several years, whether it\u2019s around expenses, de-risking the firm and growing the capital ratios, returning the capital all that work has really been about positioning the firm, while at the same time obviously maintaining all of our connectivity to clients with really, really significant operating leverage. Now this year revenue is down 9%, compensation expense down 8%, obviously that translate into a small uptick in a compensation ratio. But I would say at this stage, the center which we see hail wins in activity and increases in revenue will see that translating even more so now than we would have before to the bottom line in terms of operating leverage.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And so I can\u2019t quantify for you but if we see a big uptick in revenues, certainly you should see a decline in the compensation of ratio at which of course again as an output we\u2019re committed to delivery in this result.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Terrific, thanks a lot.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Chavez</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">First question is - yeah, good morning and Marty nice to meet you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Chavez</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Question on equities related to follow-up one of the earlier questions that was asked, you talked about maybe there were some things that weren\u2019t quite so perfect. I was wondering if you could characterize that a little bit further were there some episodic block losses that were significant in the quarter, anything that as we think about sort of what\u2019s achievable going forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">There were a handful of transactions that\u2019s it\u2019s always going to be the case in a marking making business when you are providing liquidity to clients that could have an impact that was the case this quarter. Some other things that are normal quarterly contributors and index rebalancing were more neutral and there were impact. Again I wouldn\u2019t read a lot into it from quarter to quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Remember we break out equity client execution from the whole business, so that\u2019s a different level of disclosure then you are going to get from anybody else. So you should expect given at that\u2019s the line where we are most interacting with clients and capital commitments, you should expect that to be more volatile. I just don\u2019t think any of our other competitors whenever break that, so you don\u2019t see it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">No, that\u2019s fair.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">But that\u2019s not - it wasn\u2019t the greatest quarter but there is nothing in there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. And I noticed that when you are doing a full year comparison there you talked about Asia for the full year but not for the fourth quarter, so it was - it was either more of a domestic issue in the fourth quarter or just more broadly global?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Remembering the first half of 2015, there was a huge uptick in activity in Asia and then basically there wasn\u2019t replicated. You know the client connectivity remained robust in Asia as ever but this year just not as active as it was last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Got it, and then a much broader question, I know you don\u2019t like to set ROE targets but I was wondering if in the context of what you might call for example unshackled interest rate sort of in a post QE environment and more broadly some other things that we talked about in terms of the new administrations goals and expectations thereof, can you speak to a realistic but aspiration ROE?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Well, again we don\u2019t say targets because that\u2019s not the way we run the business. We run the business through thoughtful and efficient deployment of capital managing expenses and making sure we have the best people and we\u2019re focused on our clients. I guess you saw some of this in the second half of the year right, we had two plus quarters back to back of 11% plus ROEs and that wasn\u2019t on a huge uptick in activity. And again it\u2019s one date point but it\u2019s one all point two you know in the first quarter 2015, we had a 14.7% ROE, again that feels like a long time ago. We\u2019re actually more efficient now with more operating leverage now than we had then. What we feel as front footed in terms of our franchises we ever have, so we feel well positioned which is that we see the activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And just final follow-up on that point about the activity levels and I know we\u2019ve had all of ten trading days as we get started here, so with all the necessary caveats, how are those activity levels starting the year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Way it\u2019s too early to count Guy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yeah, fair enough. Okay, thanks so much. Thanks for taking my questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Thank you, have a great day.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">You too.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Hey, good morning. Maybe just talk about the revenue side of regulatory change, I know it's not an easy question to answer, but I think there's been a lot of I guess hope and talk about sort of an easing of regulation what that could mean on the revenue side. So I don't know if there's a way to just sort of talk about it generally in terms of where do you see the most constraints right now and what would potentially benefit you the most whether it's easing of market making rules, whether it's some changes like we saw in the UK around exempting cash from the leverage ratio, if you could help that would be great?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yeah, I wouldn't point to any one rule. I think what we've seen and one of the things I think gets lost in the global dialog around regulation is that you know eight years past the crisis, the body of work that's been created by the regulators whether it's Basel capital ratios, the implementation of CCAR, stress testing broadly globally, the leverage ratios, the requirements around liquidity, all those things that were designed to address points to systemic risk, clearing, margin requirements, all of that data reporting, I think sometimes gets lost in the narrative and have to step back and look at the past eight years and realize that and it\u2019s a credible body of work that regulators, the industry participants and the clients have actually created.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I think long - I think the dialog around regulation and whether or not there should be some degree of pause and stepping back, I think that started really at the beginning of last year maybe a little bit before you saw some of that in the Basel Committee across the second half of the year, and obviously I think market participants regulators and also it seems like a very reasonable point in time to step back and assess we obviously have gotten some great benefits out of the regulation and the question is, is there a cost in economic growth. So this seems like a pretty normal part of the process in terms of taking a step back and evaluating it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Now specific rules I don\u2019t know we'll see what happens, it will change, we\u2019ll adapt however they change, I think we demonstrate our ability to do that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">But you can't, you don't feel there's one that's been more constraining than some others in terms of business?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">No, I mean if you actually look at our - if you actually look at our capital ratios they're strong across the board, liquidity is 25% of the balance sheet, and so there's not one thing that we would look at it. I think the bigger question for all of us is it's very difficult to measure the combined impact and the interaction of all these rules, and that's why it makes sense to take a step back.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Now that's all fair. And maybe just a quick one on banking, I think there's been chatter that while I think quote Animal Spirits are better and that's good for the outlook for banking I think there's some concern at least in the near to intermediate term with policy uncertainty that might hold things back a little bit in the shorter term. Are you seeing that it seems like M&amp;A activities continue to be pretty solid, but not sure what you're seeing in terms of activity levels around uncertainty short term policy uncertainty?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Dialog with - dialog in boardrooms remains quite high for us. I think it's fair to say that anytime you have a shift in administration which may present new policies that can have an impact on timing of transactions, because that could be a component. But it's really - it's a timing issue, dialog remains very high.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">But you do see timing being pushed out, what you're seeing or?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I think it could be a little bit, when you start having discussions around tax policy, tax policy obviously will have an implication for how people think about strategic transactions. But again it's an economic important to strategic transaction. It's not the strategy itself as discussed in the boardroom. And so but it could delay some transactions. Remember the transactions coming through from the pipeline before that will be closing. So again I think we're just talking about a timing issue, I actually think the environment is pretty robust in terms of dialog.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay that's great. Thanks a lot.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Chris Kotowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yeah, good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Hi Chris.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Chris Kotowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Hi, on these calls Harvey, you always talk about FICC trading activity in terms of volumes you know like commodities and currencies were up and credit mortgage down and so on. But whenever I speak with fixed income investors they always kind of be mown the lack of available liquidity in the markets, they complain that it's very hard to get anything done. And I'm wondering with between the kind of increased activity that you talked about and retrenchment of some of the competitors have bid ask spreads moved are they widening or is that not yet been part of the equation and do you ever expect that to be part of the equation?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yeah, that's a good question. I think, I think it's - I think you have to parse it a bit, to be just you mentioned commodities well pick up on commodities. If commodity prices are going to be quite stable or just take energy and they're stable at a level for a period of time that is not necessarily a catalyst for big client segments for us producers of commodities, consumers of commodities, in the institutional investors that invest in energy that's honestly catalyst for decision making.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Because they may have very determined levels at which for example a producer wants to hedge future oil production or project that they want to bring online. And so when you then see a big move in oil prices one way or another that's a catalyst for activity for our various client constituents. In terms of liquidity, I think it's fair to say that feedback from clients and it\u2019s not reason it's happened over the last several years across the industry. Is they feel like their ability to execute isn't what it was prior let's say to 2008 as a period it was perceived to have almost limitless liquidity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I think this activity picks up and volume begins volume you get improvements in liquidity, but every day we come in the door and we're offering our balance sheet, our clients in the best possible way that we can.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Chris Kotowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay and then I guess maybe as a follow up to that, I mean to the extent I guess I'd say consensus expectations build in two or three rate hikes a year, at what point does that become you know the kind of catalyst that you talked about in relation to commodities for activity?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I can't predict it for you, again in the fourth quarter alone obviously but if you just - if you just look at fourth quarter of a fourth quarter, and I won't talk about necessarily obviously activity was high and it translate into an up 78% year-over-year for us in fixed income, but the catalyst of activity are pretty obvious, right you have the oil policy, interest rate shifts, movement in currencies, all those things are catalysts for activity. I think again it goes back to the broad question what's the driver of that activity, if the expectation is more progress moving away from deflation not inflationary, but not deflationary more inflationary in a normalized period of interest rates. Those were all positive catalysts what they'll be like quarter-to-quarter very difficult, but again coming out of eight years of declining interest rates, I think would - none of us really wanted to get used to that. And so I think getting into a period of normalized economic growth would normalize policy of normalized interest rates, I think that be a good catalyst over the forward for a number of years. Quarter-to-quarter that who knows.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Chris Kotowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">All right. Thank you. That's it from me.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Hey Steven.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Good morning, hey Harvey, hey Marty. So I have follow up just to Jim's earlier question, specifically on tax policy and a comments Harvey that you made on M&amp;A, you said that you view the changes really as more of a timing issue, but one of the constraints that we've been hearing from a lot of folks, is that efforts to broaden the tax base might in fact include restrictions on interest expense deductibility and could increase financing costs and reduce appetite for future debt.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And what I'm wondering is if interest expense deductibility is in fact eliminated we do see reduced appetite from debt from corporates, as I inform your outlook not just from the M&amp;A side, but even for DCM and it might even touch on corporate private equity as well?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Well, but always puts and takes obviously that would be a very significant change in policies so would have implications for the way issuers would think, investors would think capacity, I think there's a lot of what's in the details around that. But I think it's too early to tell in terms of what the necessary predictions would be.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Understood and maybe just sticking to changes in the GOP regime and the implications I could have, but focusing more on the regulatory side there's been a lot of discussion on the prospects of possible repeal or less strict enforcement of Volcker, and Harvey I know you touched on some of the change in terms of just broader messaging, but it just remains to be seen how that might impact your business, I know it's a little bit early, but I just want to get a sense as to if we do see an explicit repeal of Volcker how that would change your strategy, not just on the trading side, but would it in fact how you deploy capital within INL as well?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yeah, so it\u2019s a good question. Look as we said before, we don't make any decisions before we see a rule or rule change there be no difference here. I think most of the discussion around will go over the last several years by regulators and industry participants and clients going back to the earlier question is what impact has it had on market making capabilities across the industry, which is obviously the most important part of our business we're providing liquidity to our clients.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I think in terms of the sort of the micro components of Volcker. We would take a look at it, if it changed in terms of our activities, proprietary trading we haven't been in that business in a long time, it was never a material driver and so we would look at it and whatever in the best interest of our clients and our shareholders that's how we evaluate it just like we devaluate any rule change.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question is from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Good morning, Harvey, good morning Marty. First a specific question then maybe a larger picture question. Harvey could you give us the updated common equity to one ratios for the fully phased in side of things, and just curious what the driver of the reduction in RWA this quarter was it was down about 5% quarter-over-quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So I'll just run through you, I\u2019ll just run through them both transitional and fully phase just the level side even though I went through them before. So under advanced 13/1 transitional 12/7 fully phased standardized again 14.5 I know I said that before fully phase 14. On the RWAs in advance 550 standardized 497 there were a number of drivers again we continue to focus on being efficient with our capital and sort of risk reduction across the number of items, operational risk in advanced was down from 126 to 115 and not just - that just reflects our continued focus on as best we can I mean zero operational risk events. Obviously that's our goal, and so we're starting to see an operational risk as you're starting to see the benefit of our focus flow through as older items roll off albeit as you know that that's a very slow process.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And then for my bigger picture question one of your competitors suggested that there was on a year-over-year basis, but a mid teens decline in European revenues, I guess I'm curious, first of all if you saw that in 2016 versus 2015 in terms of the regional breakout and it with the Prime Minister May\u2019s comments earlier this week any update to your outlook in terms of what Brexit might or might not do to quiet activity more broadly across your European client base?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yeah. So look I have no visibility into anyone else's franchise, the breakdown in terms of our geographic contribution revenues wasn't materially different year-over-year certainly difference in - no meaningful difference in our European franchise. In terms of Brexit as we go through Brexit we just continue evaluated the same way, it is obviously going to be a long process, so in all kind of contingency planners play a very nature so we'll run through different alternatives.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I thought some of the comments with respect to trying to ensure it's not disruptive, there's a long enough runway, all those things I thought some of those comments, but it is going to evolving situation. And so but I wanted to say the sensitivity to financials and understand a criticality of the industry across Europe. But of all those things we\u2019re pretty positive but again we're going to see how this evolves over the next couple years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay, fair enough. And then just finally if I can you booked your first loan in Marcus when we spoke last October, just wondering what the growth in that portfolio has been since them.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yeah we've booked more loans. I'm not counting and wanted time any more though that would have to be aware coincidence with the last call. It's going according to plan. Not in by that I mean our plan have been very deliberate growing it slowly our primary focus here is on the client experience we believe we've built I mean that differentiated for the consumer. And so we're being very attentive to that making sure we incorporate any feedback we get. And obviously risk management something we've done for a long time. So that's a big component of this, but as we've said many times to be a slow process.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Sure, thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">You're welcome. Take care now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question is from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Hey Eric.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Hi how are you? Just to follow up on a couple of questions that have been raised before, but may be taking a little more of a broader view of the balance sheet. I mean your RWAs are now it had fairly low levels now as far back maybe as my model might run. And in INL obviously the balance sheet there continues to decline although you're growing markets a bit. So overall kind of what is your - what should be our expectations about GAAP and RWA growth for 2017 and in particular is there anything that's occurring environmentally that causes you to sort of view that outlook differently than let's say three or six months ago?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">That's a great question. So you know I think I could be wrong on this by the way. So Dan will correct me, but I think it was - I think it was 2012 we were at investor conference and we did our first review of some of the capital tools we have built. And so I guess the best way I would sum it up in terms of how we thought about the risk reduction of the capital of that it goes all the way back to 2012 those tools of course took years to developing themselves. We were just displaying them in 2012 and it's really been about evolving the firm to understand that we need to ensure we use our capital in the most thoughtful way to deliver to our clients.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And as I mentioned before over that period of time we've been able to grow market shares, deliver, I think last for the industry ROEs over a multi-year period of time and at the same time we sit here today with record low share count. So the short answer after that big summary because there are so many people involved across the firm in the divisions with the clients and in the federation it's just been years of hard, hard work and a lot of elbow grease to get us where we are now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">The good thing about that is it gives us a lots of capacity, and it goes back to when we talk about operating leverage sure it's about expenses it's about capital, but it's positioning the firm in a way that we can respond to an uptick. And so I don't know if you asking the question could we grow risk weighted assets I\u2019ll tell you it would be - it's not the scenario I've experienced as CFO.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">But I would wish it for Marty over the years ahead that if he had the chance to deploy capital back to our clients not to return as much to shareholders grow risk weighted assets that actually with the firm has done for the vast majority of the firms history and those are the environments that you know we thrive in and so it was Marty and I'd pass the baton over the next couple of months, I'm hoping he gets to deploy the capital in that way with all of us across the firm. So that's my long winded answer.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Thanks that's very helpful. Thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin Ryan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Thanks, good morning, Harvey, Marty.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Good morning Devin.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Chavez</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin Ryan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Maybe timely with Marty in his new role year, but technology headcounts now about a third of the firm has been the fastest growing area in recent years and arguably the most amount of kind of the newer initiatives have come in this area. So I'm going to put the cart before the horse here, but if we are moving towards more of this business friendly backdrop where regulation softening a bit, can you see a scenario where that trend actually changes in investment high touch personnel is where the incremental growth comes from or is it just technology growth is the secular trend diverse is there being some maybe cyclical component there as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Well maybe I'll kick off and then I'll turn over to Marty and he can talk more specifically about technology, but I wouldn't say there's been a lack of investment in, I think the way you described it some of the other growth areas, right. So we've continue to invest and all parts of the firm, asset management, the new business as we've talked about launching, the acquisition of on line platform. So there's been a lack of investment in areas of the firm for years where we've seen more of a multiyear decline obviously they\u2019ve been super careful as they run those businesses. But I wouldn\u2019t describe it as we\u2019ve invested in technology, we haven\u2019t invested anywhere else. I know you weren\u2019t being that literal about it, but I just want to make sure we are clear for the call.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">But in terms of technology, specifically I\u2019ll turn it over to Marty.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Chavez</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Yeah, so as Harvey says, we invest in both in high touched and low touched and really agnostic where evolving in the direction that our clients that are taking us. So as for technology has clients have continued to transact more electronically we\u2019ve invested more heavily in those capabilities, so that we can better serve them. We have a history of that kind of adaptation. We work with the regulators to make sure that those automated capabilities are the best-in-class and to the extent that the markets continue to be more electronic, technology make our people more effective and it strengthens our clients\u2019 engagement.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin Ryan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay, great understood and appreciate all the color and absolutely you know understand the investments been across the firm, just curious on that incremental technology spend, but thank you. And then within DCM just coming back to some other questions you know had a really terrific year there obviously if the M&amp;A backdrop improves from here that it could be supportive, on the other hand you know higher interest rates you see like my constrain some issuance, I know there is a lot of puts and takes. I am just curious kind of after such a good year, how do you feel about the intermediate term kind of outlook they you think that we can grow from here or kind of as you think about all the moving parts that this is the tough bar?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I\u2019d say a couple of things first, obviously as you point out record year in the underwriting, the team done an amazing job, really working with clients and delivering for clients. So quite proud of that. You know the debt component of the backlog continues to growth, that\u2019s a necessarily forecast this year but the level of client engagement is quite high. I think there is always a temptation for all of us. I certainly do it to think of past cycles when interest rates went up in terms of the implications for markets and the market dynamic. This is such an extraordinary scenario that we\u2019re coming off of basically a zero rate policy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">So I think if you look at history, the rate levels is still pretty low even though the tenner might have moved up a 100 basis points of one point. So I think if you split your questions and say well could you end up with less refinancing, I think that\u2019s certainly a case, but we\u2019re still in a very low rate environment by historical standards and so the extent to which we see growth, company see top line growth. There are CapEx activities and they are feeling confident, they want to finance. I think you could see a pretty good period for debt underwriting over the foreseeable future. But if you saw big rate moves disproportionate charts for someone expected reason, obviously that could have an impact too. I don\u2019t think it more up in rates and in itself, it should necessarily be considered a negative in an absolute sense.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin Ryan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Great, very helpful, thanks guys.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">You next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yeah, thanks, good morning. Just two quick questions, one in the investment management, with regards to the flows in liquidity products, I mean you\u2019ve seen those kind of flows pickup in the fourth quarter of last two years, is this just where you saw this quarter again a seasonal effect with regards to liquidity products?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">No, I think that has been a trend has been in place, we had a very big commitment to this business. We\u2019re a scale provider in this business makes us very efficient in terms of an aggregator of those kind of flows. And so I don\u2019t know necessarily there is always some seasonality in these businesses but I wouldn\u2019t - this is a long term commitment of this business, I wouldn\u2019t say that is necessarily seasonality in of itself it\u2019s driving it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay. And then just one quick one to on the European equity franchise, have you seen any impacts yet from if it due and kind of what\u2019s your thoughts on long term impacts from if it due as it becomes adopted?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Lot of focus on it, too early to tell.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay, great, thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Your next question is from the line of Christopher Wheeler with Atlantic Equities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christopher Wheeler</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yes, good morning, gentlemen. Harvey, you\u2019ve been talking a lot about capital efficiency and obviously you\u2019ve been very effective in that area. Can I just ask you a question about the way forward here, because you\u2019ve been obviously very aggressive in buying back stock and keeping the capital sort of very sensible levels, but of course you\u2019ve enjoyed or you could say haven\u2019t enjoyed having stock which is trading at or below book value or tangible book value for the last few years, you\u2019ve not got a situation very happily where you offered about 1.4 times tangible book. I am just wondering I know that you want to keep the dividend at a manageable basis in terms of your payout ratio so that you don\u2019t see in swinging around volatile in a volatile fashion but have you started to think about special dividends which is being the subject that come up rather than buybacks which is start to become dilutive? Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Yeah, so look it\u2019s a good question. Just one think you said that I thought you said something like we enjoyed buying back a little book, just somewhat clear I never.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christopher Wheeler</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I know.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I never felt that enjoyable, I am always running for the share price and I am running our shareholders, so for all of our shareholders I am going to be bit confused. We route for a higher trading level.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Capital management is a long term process and so if you actually did a math in terms of the fourth quarter buying back book causes about $0.24 a share. If you actually did a corporate finance analytics around share repurchase versus dividends, share repurchase because you are reducing share and you are returning capital at the same time are always more accretive than a dividend. Now that\u2019s a map and that sort of stuff. I think the bigger issue is how we want to run the company. And we\u2019re not thinking about changing how we run the company because where the share price is. We try to run the company in the best way for our clients and our shareholders and ultimately that translates to a higher share price.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">But out policy respect to the mix being more heavily weighted to share repurchase, that has suited us quite well. It gives us exactly the kind of flexibility we\u2019ve talked about in the context of this operating leverage goal so that if we see a big pickup in demand, we can deploy that capital to our clients where ultimately that\u2019s our preferred way to deploy the capital. But you shouldn\u2019t expect any change in long term policy in terms of how we think about share repurchase relative to dividends.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christopher Wheeler</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Thank you, very clear.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">At this time there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Great, since there are no more questions, I\u2019d like to take a moment to thank all of you for joining this call. Hopefully Marty and I as well other members of senior management will see many of you in the coming months. Any additional question come up, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to Dane. Otherwise enjoy your rest of your day and we look forward to speaking with you on our first quarter earnings call on April. Thanks so much everybody, have a great day.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs fourth quarter 2016 earnings conference call.

This call is being recorded today, January 16, 2015. Thank you. Mr. Holmes, you may begin your conference.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Dane Holmes</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning.

I'll walk you through the fourth quarter and full-year results. Then I\u2019m obviously happy to answer any questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Briefly on the fourth quarter, net revenues were $7.7 billion. Net earnings were $2.2 billion and earnings per diluted share were $4.38. With respect to our annual results, we had firm-wide net revenues of $34.5 billion, net earnings of $8.5 billion, earnings per diluted share of $17.07 and a return on common equity of 11.2%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Revenues were roughly consistent with last year. We grew net earnings by 5%, book value per share by 7%, and earnings per diluted share by 10%. If we take a step back and assess 2014, there have been challenges to the global economy and therefore the operating environment for our clients.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We have seen a global economy that has been grinding itself towards growth. Different countries are naturally at different stages of the economic cycle and the interconnectedness of these different economies has made the transition to growth somewhat extended, choppy, and oftentimes unpredictable.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Having a global client footprint means that we\u2019re impacted by both global and regional fluctuations. Most importantly, it also means that we're a diversified enterprise. The consistency of our annual revenues is a testament to both the products and geographic diversity of our operations, and the stability they collectively provide.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Weakness in Asia or Europe can be offset by strength in the U.S. Headwinds in institutional client services can be offset by strength in investment banking or investment management. Ultimately, our shareholders own a combination of industry-leading global businesses that have collectively generated superior returns.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We've also achieved our results in the face of significant regulatory change. The financial services industry and our Firm specifically, have been responding to unprecedented levels of new regulation. The regulators and the industry have done a tremendous amount of work here and as a result have made the system stronger, and significantly safer.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Since 2012, we undertook several strategic initiatives to respond to new regulations and at the same time derisk the firm. This included a $55 billion balance sheet reduction over the past year. In addition, we sold our Americas reinsurance business, we sold our European insurance business and we liquidated our investment in ICBC. Along with those actions, we also sold our hedge fund administration business and our ready platform.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In 2012, the businesses and investments that I just listed produced $2.3 billion in revenue. As a result, since then we had to replace in excess of $2 billion of revenues in 2014 just to match 2012 levels.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">As I said, the last three years have required us to adapt and source new revenue opportunities at attractive returns. Between 2012 and 2014, investment banking and investment management generated $2.4 billion of incremental revenues. This achievement demonstrates the strength of our client franchise, the diversity of our operations, the commitment and quality of our people and our culture of adaptability.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Now I\u2019ll discuss each of our businesses starting with Investment Banking. Before digging into the details here, it\u2019s worth noting a few achievements from 2014. We were number one in M&amp;A, advising on more than $1 trillion in announced transactions. We also ranked first in global equity and equity-related and common stock offerings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">As it relates to the quarter, Investment Banking produced net revenues of $1.4 billion, slightly lower than the third quarter. A decline in underwriting activity offset a pick up in completed M&amp;A. For the full-year, Investment Banking net revenues were $6.5 billion, up 8% from 2013 on the back of a significant improvement in advisory revenues and modestly higher equity underwriting revenues. This was slightly offset by lower debt underwriting revenues following record results in 2013.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Breaking down the components of Investment Banking in the fourth quarter, advisory revenues were $692 million; the 16% increase relative of the third quarter reflects the increase in industry-wide completed M&amp;A. We advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the fourth quarter, including Walgreen\u2019s $15.3 billion acquisition of the remaining 55% interest in Alliance Boots, Royal KPN\u2019s 8.4 billion euro of E-plus to Telefonica, Deutschland and Athlon Energy\u2019s $7.1 billion sale to Encana.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We also advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the fourth quarter, including Allergan\u2019s $66 billion sale to Actavis, Baker Hughes $38 billion sale to Halliburton and Talisman Energy\u2019s $13 billion sale to Repsol.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Moving to underwriting, net revenues were $748 million in the fourth quarter, down 14% sequentially with both equity and debt issuance slowed. Equity underwriting revenues of $342 million, were down 20% compared to third quarter results largely due to a decrease in secondary offerings and private placements. Debt underwriting revenues decreased 9% to $406 million due to a significant decline in leverage finance activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">During the fourth quarter, we actively supported our clients' financing needs, participating in Becton Dickinson\u2019s $7.2 billion financing to support their purchase of CareFusion, ICBC\u2019s $5.6 billion debt offering and Fiat Chrysler\u2019s $4 billion common stock and convertible offering. Our Investment Banking backlog improved from third quarter levels and finished at its highest level since 2007.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our FICC and equities businesses. Net revenues were $3.1 billion in the fourth quarter, down 17% compared to the third quarter. For the full-year, $15.2 million of net revenues were down 3% relative to 2013. FICC Client Execution net revenues were $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter and include a $55 million of DVA gains. Excluding DVA, and last quarter\u2019s gain related to our trust preferred tender, revenues were down 41% sequentially as certain businesses were impacted by either lower client activity or more difficult market making conditions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Interest rates were lower sequentially as client activity declined amid a challenging environment. Credit decreased as the market was characterized by widening high-yield spreads and low levels of liquidity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Mortgages declined versus the third quarter, as volatility and client activity were generally low. While currencies was lower than a very robust third quarter, volatility remain high and client activity were still solid. Even higher volatility and energy markets, commodities improved sequentially and were supported by stronger client activity levels. For the full-year, FICC client execution net revenues were $0.5 billion, down 2% year-over-year. Excluding DVA, the gain related to our trust preferred tender, and the impact of the 2013 European Insurance sale, revenues were down 5% relative to 2013.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees and security services, net revenues for the fourth quarter were $1.9 billion, up 21% sequentially and included $27 million in DVA gains. Equities Client Execution revenues increased 75% sequentially to $751 million due to a more favorable backdrop with higher equity prices and increased client activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Commissions and Fees were $829 million, up 11% relative to the third quarter supported by an increase in client volumes. Security Services generated net revenues of $351 million, up 2% sequentially adjusting for last quarter\u2019s gain related to our trust preferred tender.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">For the full-year, equities produced net revenues of $6.7 billion, down 5% year-over-year. Excluding DVA, the gain related to our trust preferred tender and the 2013 sale of our reinsurance business, results were down 4% relative to 2013.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to risk. Average daily VaR in the fourth quarter was $63 million, down from $66 million in the third quarter with the largest decrease coming from interest rates.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Moving on to our Investing &amp; Lending activities. Collectively these businesses produced net revenues of $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of $982 million, primarily reflecting company specific events including initial public offerings and gains in public equity investments. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $358 million, which was relatively balanced between net interest income and net gains on certain investments. Other revenues of $192 million include the Firm\u2019s consolidated investments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In the fourth quarter, we sold our investment in Metro International. For the fourth quarter and full-year, Metro contributed $70 million and $325 million respectively to other revenues. For the full-year, Investing and Lending generated net revenues of $6.8 billion, driven by $3.8 billion in gains from equity securities, $2.2 billion of net revenues from debt securities and loans and $847 million of other revenues.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In Investment Management, we reported fourth quarter net revenues of $1.6 billion, up 7% from the third quarter primarily as a result of $200 million in incentive fees largely from alternative asset products. Management and other fees were up 1% sequentially to a record $1.23 billion. For the full-year, Investment Management net revenues were a record $6 billion, up 11% from 2013 on record management and other fees which benefited from growth in our assets under supervision. During the fourth quarter assets under supervision increased $28 billion to a record $1.18 trillion, due to net inflows into liquidity products.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On a full-year basis, we have long-term fixed income inflows of $58 billion and equity inflows of $15 billion. Alternative inflows were $1 billion and included $6 billion from fund of funds offset by net outflows from other private equity and credit funds.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Moving to our performance, across the globe, 83% of our client mutual fund assets ranked in the top two quartiles on a three-year basis. And 75% ranked in the top two quartiles on a five-year basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as benefits, remain roughly flat at $12.7 billion for 2014 and translated into a compensation-to-net revenues ratio of 36.8%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Fourth quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.5 billion, 11% higher than the third quarter, reflecting $137 million donation to Goldman Sachs Gives, our donor advised charitable fund. For the full-year, non-compensation expenses were down 4%, primarily due to lower provisions for litigation and regulatory expenses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Total staff at year-end was approximately 34,000, up 3% from year-end 2013. Our effective tax rate was 31.4% for 2014. Our global core excess liquidity end of the quarter at $183 billion. Our Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 12.2% using the advanced approach. It was 11.3% under the standardized approach.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Our supplementary leverage ratio finished the quarter at 5%. The Firm is now compliant with the 2018 minimum.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We repurchased 6.6 million shares of common stock for $1.25 billion during the quarter. For the full-year, we repurchased $5.5 billion helping to reduce our average fully delivered share count by 26 million shares year-over-year. In addition, we increased our quarterly dividend to $0.60 per share in the fourth quarter and paid out approximately $1 billion of common dividends during the year. In total, we return $6.5 billion of capital to shareholders while at the same time continuing to grow our regulatory capital ratios.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Now before I take your questions, let me offer some closing thoughts. Looking back on our performance in 2014, the Firm continued to execute on its operating strategy. We remain committed to our clients, providing superior service and execution which is central to building any long-term relationship. The strength of our client franchise is reflected in our returns and our leading market position. For example, we ended the year as the global leader M&amp;A with more than $1 trillion in announced transactions. This is nearly $250 billion greater than our next closest competitor.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We were ranked first in global equity, and equity related and common stock offerings for 2014. We helped deliver nearly $300 billion in equity capital from our investing clients to our corporate clients. We executed more than 2 billion transactions for our institutional investing clients across equities, fixed income, currencies, and commodities. And we\u2019re the trusted investment manager for in excess of $1 trillion in assets. Our track record of performing for our clients has translated into a leading market position within each of our businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Another area of focus has been on our efficiency, well operating efficiency and capital. We announced an expense initiative from a position of strength in 2011. We believe this was an important step, which positioned us to remain externally focused over the past three years. Continued discipline on compensation levels and focus on non-compensation expenses has contributed to 300 basis points of pre-tax margin expansion since 2012.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Our capital philosophy is also clear. Having a strong capital base, not only allows our firm to be front footed in helping our clients capturing opportunities, but also provides protection in more difficult operating environments. The existence of multiple capital regulations has materially increased the need for robust capital planning tools. To try better capital efficiency and comply with new regulatory requirements, we\u2019ve developed critical technology and operating infrastructure to inform our allocation decisions. While they can never replace good judgment, these tools certainly help to inform it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">In closing, Goldman Sachs is essentially made up of our clients, your capital, and our people. Our Firm stands ready to use its financial and intellectual capital to serve our clients through this evolving period in the global economy. We are committed to consistently delivering the Firm and its entirety to our clients and maximizing our impact. And we\u2019re equally committed to generating superior returns for our shareholders through the cycle.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Thank you again for dialing in. And now I'm happy to answer any questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p5\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Hi. Thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Hey, good morning, Glenn.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Good morning. First one on Investing and Lending. You had mentioned that there are a bunch of sales inside the equity piece. Would you mind just updating us on what\u2019s left in the book equity wise that eventually has to be liquidated for Goldman? And in conjunction with that, have you been replacing on balance sheet to backfill?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So we will just take a step back. You remember from the third quarter, the Investing and Lending balance sheet was roughly $76 billion, which broke down roughly 14 -- $4 billion of public equity, $18 billion of private equity and the balance really -- the vast majority of the balance sheet in that north of $50 billion. And so in terms of the -- in the equity line, I think what you\u2019re continuing to see is just really the idiosyncratic performance of the portfolio. We\u2019ve guided you over time that over long periods the portfolio will correlate with the MSEI [ph] or other public indices and -- but there will still be times where we will outperform that or under-perform that. And in this particular quarter, there were -- really the vast majority of the gains in the portfolio were driven by things that we refer to as event driven. So it was either the potential for very near-term IPO we took something public where there was a refinancing event. We don\u2019t look at this of course on a quarterly basis, but you will remember I highlighted to you in the last quarter that when we\u2019ve taken Mobileye public it had contributed $285 million in revenues and that would be an example of something that it was down during the course of the quarter, that was down a bit more than $70 million. In terms of reinvesting and the portfolio, our strategy here is unchanged in terms of our philosophy, in terms of how we think about the capital. Where we can deploy capital to our clients and where we can find attractive returns, then we will pursue them, but we\u2019re going to be very disciplined about the kind of returns that we can gain out of the marketplace. And so you will continue to see us do this one good thing in the quarter that you saw was that the regulators finalized the extension of the Volcker Rule and so there will be two one year extension there. So that was good to see as -- I think it was thoughtful by the regulators, because it will -- would have otherwise we might have seen fire sales across the marketplace.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">And equity left, Goldman\u2019s equity piece left? I think it went from 9 to 8 to 6, if my memory serves me correctly. Where are we at now?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So are you talking about sort of -- there is two things that sometimes I didn\u2019t get [indiscernible]. I think if you\u2019re firmly [indiscernible] where the -- our investment is in terms of the private equity portfolio that was -- we were discussing under Volcker before the extensions, that\u2019s roughly around $8 billion. There was some harvesting, but that was offset by some gains. Again, now that\u2019s an extended two years. If you're talking about the significant financial institution reduction which is a separate number that relates to our Basel III capital ratios, that\u2019s now roughly about $5 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay, perfect. That's what I was looking for.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Sorry, I wasn\u2019t sure exactly. I probably should have gotten there faster.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">No, I probably should have worded it better. So then a big picture question, a couple of quarters ago, we are all bumming out that every volatility chart points down. Now rates, volatility, oil volatility, FX volatility, credit volatility all thumbs up, and all the banks get beaten up on inventories that we thought were a lot less. So could we talk about good vol versus bad vol and what we are supposed to root for?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Yes, it\u2019s I don\u2019t know it\u2019s a little -- I guess it\u2019s -- what is it? Is it a Goldilocks? Its too cold, its too hot? We can\u2019t find the right temperature. I think when you look -- I find it very interesting to sort of juxtapose the third quarter and the fourth quarter, because I think it really highlights what you\u2019re saying. We came into the third quarter and as you said everybody bemoaning knew the fact that there was nothing happening in the world in July and then we got into the summer doldrums of August. And then we came back and foreign exchange was very active. There was a lot of momentum and you saw big uptick in client activity in certain parts of the business. Now we come into the fourth quarter and I don\u2019t know if you want to call it unhealthy volatility, but in October we had our -- whatever you want to refer to in markets, now referred to as the Treasury Flash Crash. And then, Greece, the continuation of Russia, a huge decline in the oil price, which of course it started in June, but nearly came into frame in the fourth quarter which weighed heavily on credit markets. And so, I don't think when you look back in the fourth quarter, any of this should be particularly surprising. When you see that much pressure on credit markets, in terms of the ability as a market maker on the course of the quarter, to manage liquidity, I don\u2019t think its particularly surprising, particularly the stress that came under high-yield as a result of the energy decline. Now for us, there were some real bright spots in the quarter in fixed income, which is why we think about it long-term, we will tell you that the energy price has been declining, our ability to be an active and valuable provider of hedging solutions that a market maker do are energy sensitive and commodity sensitive clients. Was it\u2019s a kind of thing you really see. But it's not always going to be case that in a given quarter, I need to pretty unique events we\u2019re talking about. But again, in the end it\u2019s all going to be driven by the client activity, client uncertain types of volatility will drive more client activity. And certain will make people want a recede and be a little more protective. I know we\u2019re all focused on it, but quarter over quarter when you think of the events; I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a surprising actually.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Then the follow-on on that is just, in credit specifically, which is probably the most liquidity-dependent. Do the desks themselves, or do your risk management practices, do you tend to exit positions during times of stress like that or should we be thinking about you are sitting on the same kind of book right now, just at lower prices?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So we\u2019re always managing the risk components of many of our books, regardless of the environment. And the kind of market that we\u2019re talking about, it\u2019s really very natural on what they\u2019re doing at the desk level. So they\u2019re obviously fulfilling their client responsibilities in terms of making market, but it can be particularly challenging from time to time. But again, this is a long-term commitment. I wouldn\u2019t say that there were any significant support, exposures, in terms of that we are really focused on. But obviously things that have been in frame for a while Russia, Greece, energy whatever the case might be. Obviously we pay a lot of attention to those things. Again, as we\u2019ve said in the past Glenn, it's a moving business not a storage business. And just sometimes moving is harder.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">I appreciate that. My times up, thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Hey, Glenn. Thanks so much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Thanks, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Good morning, Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Hi. Harvey, just upfront you mentioned a lot of the businesses that have been repositioned. I think you mentioned the $2.3 billion on the revenue side. I guess when we look at 2015, near now that most of the rules are finalized; I guess is the vast majority of the repositioning out of the way? I guess because when I look at the ratios, you're basically where you need to be. So should we see ongoing like revenue headwinds, or is the repositioning mostly through?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So look we will have to see as all the rules ultimately get finalized. There is still a number of rules out there, but so I\u2019d say things that we very deliberately did in terms of derisking the firm or responding to regulatory requirements like the sales of the insurance business, the other things I listed, there is nothing right now that we\u2019re looking at you should expect to see in the near-term. Having said that, these businesses have always been dynamic, they will remain dynamic and over the next many years things will continually evolve and we look to be very dynamic in all of those businesses, whether they\u2019re market structure changes, whether they\u2019re things like we\u2019ve seen in terms of regulatory driven. I mean it just -- I think this is what you need to do to manage the business as well. So we will continue to focus on capital and make sure we\u2019re using the capital as efficiently and effectively as possible, all these things are just part of daily life.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay, got it. And then just maybe on the same topic, or somewhat related to it, just in terms of your Tier 1 ratio going up to 12.2, if you can give us the components. It looks like RWA shrunk in the quarter, but just want to know what drove that, and then going forward is there anything else in the pipeline?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So in the third quarter [indiscernible] it went up to 12/2 as I referenced. So on the -- if you really want to break that down into the molecules, give or take roughly 10 basis points came from just growth in capital. Another 10 basis points came from various steps we\u2019re taking in terms of managing the capital better and then the balance -- really it was about risk reduction and it was much driven by the drop off in client activity towards the end of the quarter than anything else. So you could see this bounce back. In terms of staff again, we\u2019re going to continue to adjust all the capital rules, and as I said we\u2019ve invested heavily in getting the tools out and as we discussed at your conference, we now have a uniform framework that we\u2019re deploying across the Firm in terms of that how we think about best utilizing their capital ensuring that we position it most effectively for all of our clients and so, again that\u2019s going to be, I don\u2019t know if you want to call part of the new world, but that\u2019s part of the world that we live in now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Got it. And then, last one, just given the volatility that we\u2019re seeing both in the oil markets, more recently in the FX market. Just want to get, your guys perspective of obviously you mentioned on the commodity side that can present same opportunities in terms of more activity. On the flipside is lot of risk associated with that, depending on what happens, just want to see how you guys are managing that risk. In the quarter, was there anything significant particularly in the FICC, just because it was a little lighter than expected. That weight on any of the segments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So as I said in the quarter, it really was a tough quarter in the credit business, also when mortgages on a relative basis, but more pronounced in the credit business areas. In terms of the commodity businesses, I think it\u2019s almost worth taking a step back. If you think about over the last couple of years, we\u2019ve often been asked a question hey, it seems like everybody else is getting out of the commodity business. How come you\u2019re not getting out of the commodity business? And for sure commodities have been quite for a little while and we\u2019ve got -- you remember we got that question pretty frequently and the answer give us a pretty straightforward which is when we dealt with our clients we knew the business of hedging, managing their risks, investing in clients. We knew that was an important part of what they did and it ties very nicely into our investment banking franchise where we provided advice and capital to all those clients.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And so, I know it\u2019s a bit of a reminder when you see the fourth quarter where you see a pick up in performance that reinforces that you which really need to listen to your clients when you\u2019re thinking about your strategy in terms of the businesses that you invest in and those businesses you protect across the cycle. And so, part of the consistency that you\u2019ve seen from us is the investment in these various businesses across a long cycle. It might be commodities. A couple of years ago, people were talking about the fact that merger were never coming back. And so from a commodity perspective, in terms of risk, our risks are quite manageable to the sector. You would asked that also, so I just want to finish with that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. Sounds good. Thanks a lot.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question comes from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Good morning, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hey, good morning. Thanks for dialing in.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thank you. Just on the Outlook for 2015, in your press release earlier this morning, Lloyd struck an optimistic tone speaking to seeing evidence of a pick up in a global economy that will improve the opportunity set for 2015? Could you be a bit more specific and speak to how you see that improved opportunity set a evolving on a business by business basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So I will give you my perspective on that. When you talk to the economists inside Goldman Sachs, the general view whether you\u2019re talking about the U.S which clearly have a more optimistic view in terms of growth. Europe, Asian, is generally positive and as I said its more of a continue grinding forward. And so, if we see continued stability in terms of market, normalization of interest rates and really fundamentally steady growing GDP. Those are the things that are historically over cycles. Have translated well for us, because it contributes to global confidence and global confidence contributes to activity. And so, it kind of gets back to the theme I started with earlier which is -- in over the last couple of years, we\u2019re ourselves have made adjustment in an environment which has been choppy as I said and also a bit on event and what we needed to do is, we needed replace significant revenues and so you see what we\u2019re doing to the extent which we hopefully will have fewer revenues replaced in the future. Hopefully this will translate into growth. But, again it\u2019s all going to be driven by the environment. That\u2019s the one thing we can\u2019t control. We can just respond it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. On the equities business, I apologize if I missed this in your prepared remarks. But just curious as to what drove the strength in the equity kind of execution line?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So for a couple of quarters, I know you were focused on, it looks a little lower. In this particular quarter, there were some very solid opportunities to provide capital declines and volumes but again when you look across the equity business, when we see uptick in client activity and when you see trending prices, the strength of a franchise really comes to the front whether its in prime brokerage client execution or commissions and fees.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. Sounds like its a little more lumpy than you would normally expect for the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">There is some seasonality in there, there is some rebalances that we participated in some other things, but again these are one time event. They\u2019re just annual event. They haven\u2019t drilled the course of the year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. And then just lastly for me a quick clean up question. Under sale of Metro, you noted $325 million in revenues last year. What kind of costs came with those revenues?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">It\u2019s a very small contributor to pre-tax.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Perfect.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">You shouldn\u2019t think of it as meaningful at all in pretext terms.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Perfect. Thank you, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Operator </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with COSA. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Hi.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Good morning, Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Given the big movement, the Swiss franc there is some reports that banks lost some big money, specifically what happened this week. Can you comment and then more generally, how would this impact to your move towards electronic trading of FX?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So well, first of all, in terms of Goldman Sachs, immaterial from an economic perspective. So you\u2019re only worried about that, there is noting there. I will say what we all witnessed yesterday is pretty extraordinary. I haven't confirmed any stats , but just going to with some of the folks, the single largest move in a day of any developed country, I think it was something like a 20 plus standard deviation move. I think it was like after three plus years of 2% volatility. So you\u2019re right to call it extraordinary, but again no issues here. For us it really is an opportunity, really for very high-level engagement with clients who both need liquidity and then the longer term questions about working with local corporates who had an immediate shift in competitiveness and what does that mean? So there\u2019ll be obviously a long-term focus. In terms of each rating, there\u2019s only things you take away from these or I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll potentially be some lessons learned, but I don\u2019t necessarily have any major takeaways. It certainly doesn\u2019t change our investments largely in terms if you think about each rating.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And then one other question, you mentioned the 300 basis point pre tax margin improvement since 2012. I have to imagine it might get tougher if revenues don\u2019t grow more. What are some additional levers you have for pre tax margin? You\u2019ve got a lot on non-comp and you certainly have done a lot on comp. Is there any more to go?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So, well first of all Mike I appreciate acknowledging our effort on expansion because it has been really a multi-year effort in terms of being disciplined. Again it\u2019s going to be environment driven. Right now when we look at the global footprint, we feel really, really well positioned in terms of our geographic footprint and our product footprint. But we\u2019re committed to staying very focused on expenses. You\u2019re not going to see us take the foot off here, and so, we\u2019ll see. The big thing that we\u2019ve been trying to achieve in the last couple of years as we\u2019ve talked about a lot is putting an operating leverage. And while we\u2019ve replaced the two plus billion dollars in revenues over the last couple of years, it would be great we\u2019d all like to see the environment being one that provided another couple of billion dollars in revenues, and we think we have that operating leverage. So we feel well positioned.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">All right. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thanks Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Hi, Matt.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">If I can first follow up on the expense question, maybe just trying to get a little more detail in terms of the opportunity from here. I think you and a lot of other firms have a relocation strategy trying to bring down some of the especially back office and non-sales facing costs. Maybe if you could just kind of frame it the opportunity there; I think a lot of people also look at the state of raw and think those opportunities to become less top heavy and then obviously there\u2019s the new structural reduction in comp that does contribute it. So, maybe just pushing a little bit on where you can go from here on expenses?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So as part of the expense probably from the last couple of years, and it\u2019s a great question. As you know, we have been diversifying ourselves geographically in places like Salt Lake City, Bangalore and others and it represent about 25% of the firm\u2019s headcount at this stage give or take. I think there is continued opportunity. One thing I\u2019ll say which is, something at this stage which is hard to quantify, but we\u2019re looking to take a leadership role in which is, over the next several years as you really get all these rules in place around all the various training venues around the world. There certainly will be a need for scale consistency across the various market participants and the way things are processed, the way information is managed, the way transactions are confirmed and things are reported, and so the short note of that is, internally we\u2019re going to continue to lever technology anywhere we can and that\u2019s been a big part of what we\u2019ve done. But we\u2019re also going to try and do that as much as we can working with other folks in the industry and our clients to make sure all being is efficient as we possibly can as we all work in the same rule set. Now, you didn\u2019t specifically ask about it, but obviously we\u2019re going to stay relentlessly focused on the balance sheet and how we deploy our capital.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. Actually that kind of brings me to the next question. Earlier it was asked about looking at maybe businesses or areas to get out of a swap, but as we just think about your current business mix and the opportunity to adopt to the new capital rules, how much opportunity is there to refine the balance sheet and have those ratios increase more than you would think just based on say the net income less capital deployment?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Well, I think when you look at our ratios now, but we think they\u2019re in quite a good place. We\u2019ll see what happens with the, when the final rules are done. I guess, I would say, we start again with the client businesses and given the strength of all of our businesses at this stage, equities, fixed income, investment banking, asset management, our investing and lending business. We look at the strength of those business leads and our competitive position, it really feels at this stage it\u2019s very, very tactical and it\u2019s about fine point execution. Now of course that could all change and again we\u2019ll stay nimble, but that\u2019s where we would stand today.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. And I guess, just to push on that like, it was just a year and half ago that the supplemental leverage ratio was even proposed, so I would assume it\u2019s hard to be completely efficient in adopting that throughout the businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes, sorry. I think you\u2019ll continue to see improvement in things like that. That\u2019s not what I was saying. What I was saying is, its going to be tactical and we\u2019ll continue to work at it because you\u2019re right, we\u2019re new and we\u2019re just living with it. But I don\u2019t see it at this stage given the adjustments the business we\u2019ve sold, the things we\u2019ve done, the balance sheet. I don\u2019t see us making bigger decision in terms around our business commitment and our commitment to our clients. That\u2019s what I meant. So you\u2019re not going to see the sales and other reinsurance business soon.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. But just the, adopting these -- on the day sale question is, how much optimizing is there out there further due maintaining your current strategy and the strengths that you have?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We can always do more and you\u2019ll see us do more. But I\u2019m not in a position to quantify for you today.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. All right. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Hi, good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Good morning, Betsy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I just wanted to ask a couple of questions on VaR. I was intrigued by the straightforward which came down queue-on-queue and obviously we had the flash crash in October. So does this represent maybe a VaR that went up early in the quarter? And then as folks move to the sidelines that came back down or am I thinking about that wrong?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So, if you look at the in the VaR quarter-over-quarter it went from 66% down to 63% and you see the rate category move down current changes are but it sort of followed more the flows and levels of activity. In some businesses it was the result of position changes, but I don\u2019t think there is any major takeaways market volatility was a bigger driver and position changes was really a net reduction.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">[Indiscernible] volatility, you had essentially bad volatility in rates, so I suppose that\u2019s why it came down a bit, but should we expect that is, if you get some slightly higher volatility or I would expect it would move higher. Is that accurate or no?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes, so I think maybe the best way to answer this question is to think about it in terms of average volatility across the quarter, and so the way we look at it because as we\u2019ve discussed before from a risk perspective VaR is an important risk measure, but obviously it can be influenced by market volatilities. So, if you actually, if you look at the change in terms of how it moved the market volatility was an increase it was more or less offset by position reductions during the course of the quarter and that\u2019s what drove the change. In rate specifically volatility was up and our positions were down. And that probably gives you a really good roadmap in terms of how the risk moved during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes. Got it. Okay. And then separately just could you give us a sense as to how you\u2019re thinking about the asset management business and opportunities to expand that inorganically if there is any sense of \u2026?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So you\u2019ve seen us do small bolt-on acquisitions over time. We\u2019re constantly looking at things. Obviously asset management has been a very important driver of growth over the last several years and this is, we\u2019re really -- I think in the early stages of where you\u2019re seeing a strategic initiative to grow asset management, the team has done a great job and I highlighted the three and the five year returns. So, we\u2019re open to really looking at anything, and so it\u2019s really all -- we\u2019ll all be driven by whether or not we think we can improve our performance and deliver better results for our clients. So, I would say we\u2019re very open-minded. But again, these things have to be accretive and we look through them at a very careful lens.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And distribution, is that something that you could potentially add to?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">We feel quite good about the -- we really do feel like we have a significantly differentiated private wealth franchise and our institutional team is great and we get a lot of value out of our third party distributors and so, again Betsy, look we\u2019re the leading M&amp;A firm in the world. So I think it was good idea walking the door and one of our bankers had it, we\u2019d be the first firm to talk about it. It will be a little inconsistent with our whole philosophy not to talk about it, but it\u2019s not a priority right now for us. It\u2019s really about performance and delivering for the clients.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question is from the line of Jeff Harte with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Good morning, Jeff.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jeffery Harte</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Good morning, Harvey. A couple of things. One, we\u2019ve seen the volatility kind of spike on and off for a number of months now. Do you have a sense for how this is impacting kind of client risk appetites and their willingness to transact? And I\u2019m kind of thinking corporate investment and investing clients in investment banking as I suppose it is while in trading.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So, look I think, when you think about investment banking clients and CEOs and Boards and CFOs in terms of how they\u2019re making long-term strategic decisions, that\u2019s really -- that will be influenced by day-to-day volatility and obviously every informational fact is digested. But those long-term strategic decisions are really based more on long-term competitive drive and global growth and that kind of stability. And so, it\u2019s a factor, but as I said when we went to the call we comment with our backlog at the highest point it\u2019s been since 2007 and that should give you some indications of what we think the momentum is in the advisory business. It could always change but that\u2019s where the momentum stands today. In terms of the investing clients and those involved in the capital markets more directly, it\u2019s an interesting question. In periods where there is less friction and ease of volatility -- ease of liquidity, liquidity begets activity, and maybe the language we should we be using is less about volatility and more about volatility and liquidity. Volatility when absence of liquidity is maybe that on friendly version that people are looking to try and find language to describe, and when you have volatility but you have liquidity you can then react and you can execute on the new information you receive. So I\u2019m not sure I got to your questions, but I tried.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jeffery Harte</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. You talked kind of on the M&amp;A, so I mean is it similar for some of the underwriting businesses that it means you\u2019re not seeing the volatility kind of cause corporate clients to maybe pull back on plans there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So, I don\u2019t know if I necessarily say its pointing back on plans in terms of the -- its really more whether the market is more receptive or not. If you really just wanted to contrast underwriting activity in the fourth quarter of 2013 with the fourth quarter of 2014, you just saw capital markets that kind of thundered through the end of the year last year, and this year the capital market just had a lot more to digest. I would say that was more driven by the investing side, basically saying, hey look lets take a pause and lets reassess versus issuers desire to issue at low yield and obviously there was spread pressure on a high yield as people digested the low energy prices, but we\u2019ll see how the year goes. I mean I think at these rate levels and these equity market levels their activity levels could be robust during the course of the year, but again we\u2019ll have to see what the market delivers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jeffery Harte</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. And expenses have been here in a couple of times, but I think kind of maybe more directly my question would be, have we hit a point where we need to see revenue growth to see further profit margin expansion?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Well, it will depend on what happens in the environment. I mean, again we\u2019re going to stay very focused on both lines. And so again, I guess, I could add to that question, and the risk is sounding a little bit cute, and we would have actually grown it and revenues have been flat, and it haven\u2019t really been flat because we\u2019ve been growing other businesses. So, we\u2019ve displayed the ability to do it for the last couple of years. Look, we\u2019re going to be very, very thoughtful as we have been about the balance of investing in the businesses where we see long-term growth. But again that won't -- we\u2019re not going to stop our relentless focus on efficiency.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jeffery Harte</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. And finally we\u2019re starting to hear again some talk of some competitors at least exiting some of the trading businesses and do you see that as a kind of competitive opportunity, I mean does it help you to maybe expand wallet share, improved pricing or is it just some of the businesses aren\u2019t as profitable and we hope eye is going to shrink. Are you seeing some of that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So we\u2019re certainly seeing in various businesses we feel it at least. Again we don\u2019t have full transparency, but in our dialogue with our clients we felt that in commodities this year. We\u2019ve seen it in other parts of the business. I guess, what I would say is in an environment like this, in terms of the competitive dynamic, I think if you want to be in these businesses through the whole cycle, I think some of the takeaway\u2019s are you have to have scale. It\u2019s very hard just to be in cash equities or to be in a very small component of the foreign exchange market. And you have to be able to leverage that scale really across the full franchise. It\u2019s not really just about the equity business, the prime brokerage business or the commodity business. You need technology scale to really be effective through the whole cycle and then you need the diversity because as we\u2019ve seen some pistons will fire sometime and sometimes they won't at other points as we go through this. And so, I know that\u2019s why we feel good about our competitive position because we know our clients still want to trade bonds, and we know they still want to hedge FX and we know they still want to manage their commodity risk. As we work through this part of the cycle it\u2019s just about us being well positioned and having that scale, and we feel like we have it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jeffery Harte</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Hi, Guy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Good morning. Just to follow-up on the VaR question but to ask it in terms of the change for the full year. Can you give us a sense just as you walk through the different asset classes of how much of the change over the course of the year was position reduction versus volatility change?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So you\u2019re saying last year versus this year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yes. So for example, if we look at rates, over the course of the year it fell from 62% to 41%. And I\u2019m just curious how much of that change was reduction in positions versus change in volatility sort of what are the components?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Hey, I apologize. Dane can get it to you. I don\u2019t have the line-by-line in my head in terms of that. But I can tell you on the year-over-year in aggregate, but I\u2019d say what I mean line-by-line I don\u2019t have the specific categories in my head. But year-over-year the -- basically position changes were a reduction that was about three times the increase in terms of the volatility levels. So its real risk reduction.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Got it. Okay. That\u2019s exactly what I was trying to get to and maybe I\u2019ll follow up on the others, but that\u2019s real helpful. On the -- just a housekeeping question, on the core Tier 1, the 12.2% is advanced approach is transitional right. Can you update us on the fully phased?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Sure. So, it\u2019s 11.1% under the fully phased. You want me to give you the standardized that\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yes, exactly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay, fine. Okay, so 11.3% as I said under the transitional for standardized and then 10.2% under fully phased. Now just a reminder on this, fully phased for us is really a conservative expectation, all other factors being equal in other words, we just stood here today with exactly the same balance sheet and nothing changed except for the retirement of funds as we comply with Volcker doing other things. You should probably add back to call it 40 basis points, 50 basis points to those fully funded number -- those fully phased numbers. Okay?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. That\u2019s also really helpful. And the question has kind of been asked a couple of times, but maybe I\u2019ll take a slightly different crack at it. In terms of the volatility that we\u2019ve seen, since the first of the year not just in terms of what happened yesterday in the currency market but more broadly with rates, long rates. I know we\u2019re only couple of weeks into the year, but do you expect a significant rethink in terms of the amount of risk that you and peers will be putting on the desks between now and the end of the quarter, the middle of the year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So, it\u2019s a great question because it allows me just to underscore a very important point. We scale our risk deployment to our client demand not the other way, and so it will really depend on what happens in terms of clients and their perceptions in the marketplace. And again I think it goes back to -- if you compare the third quarter to the fourth quarter. If we see more Septembers, than I think you will see increasing amount of client activity and opportunities for us to provide liquidity to our clients and deploy capital. I think if you see more Octobers and more Decembers, I think you might see less. Again, that\u2019s why we run these businesses for the long-term. I think importantly, one of the takeaways around these businesses is that there are times when things do change structurally. One of the structural changes its been on a decade plus shift to electronics rating and the need for technology. The people still wake up every morning and they want to trade bonds and they want to hedge foreign exchange. Nothing about that is changed. Its just where we\u2019re in the cycle.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Got it. One final question and this isn\u2019t something that you frequently disclose, but there was a disclosure a number of years ago, that sort of in the period between 2006 and 2009, about half of your FICC revenues had been in some derivatives and now that we\u2019ve been through a significant period of regulatory change in terms of derivatives and cost of carry and everything. I was wondering if you could comment for 2014 roughly what percentage of thick revenues would have come from derivative transactions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yes, I don\u2019t have that data handy, but we can dig into it. And if its meaningful we can certainly share it with folks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I mean, I guess, the only follow up would be -- I get that, but is it meaningfully less than it used to be?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Well the one thing I would say that, and maybe these are good things, but host the crises, lots of things they build up in 2006 and 2007 like clients trading correlation and other things which during the crises proved to be less liquid than other things, that certainly looked like businesses that maybe gone forever. You always has been set up but it feels that way for now and maybe they should be. So, there\u2019s certainly elements in the derivative market that appears structurally changed since the crises. But we don\u2019t track that specifically from an auditor perspective, so I don\u2019t have that data.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. Well, thanks for the color though. I appreciate it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question is from the line of Fiona Swaffield with RBC. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Hi, Fiona.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Fiona Swaffield</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Hi.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Hi.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Fiona Swaffield</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Sorry, can you hear me?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yes, no worry.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Fiona Swaffield</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Sorry, some problems with the phone. Can you talk a bit about, I think you said this in the fourth quarter the de-risking helped the RWAs. But I mean, historically you\u2019ve talked about mitigation going forward. So can you talk about your plans kind of Basel III RWAs, and also I know its early days but there\u2019s some new proposals after Basel before Christmas. Do you have any kind of thoughts on those or how they would, could affect you the U.S. bank?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So, on the new proposals obviously we\u2019ll do what we\u2019ve done in the past. We want to be an active and constructive participant in the dialogue with the regulators, but its pretty early days on lots of those discussions. But again, we\u2019ll just participate in that dialogue and you\u2019ll see our comments and things like that. In terms of, I think there\u2019s an important thing to highlight here; there were no businesses here that we\u2019re looking to shutdown in terms of driving improving capital ratios. We feel quite good with the significant progress our teams have made over the last couple of years. Now having said that again this is something that I just think that there is standard operating procedure for any regulated financial institution in terms of having technology, tool, education and a process towards making sure you deploy your capital in a way that\u2019s most impactful for your clients and provide your shareholders with the best return. And so, I think that\u2019s just standard operating procedure for us. So you\u2019ll continue to see us mitigate, but at this stage we made a huge amount of progress, I mean, there\u2019s a whole lots of things I can highlight. I think the balance sheet reduction exercise in the second quarter was a real demonstration of response to nimbleness.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Fiona Swaffield</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Hi, good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Good morning, Jim.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Just quickly maybe if you can talk about some of the other, the more liquidity ratios. Do you have any kind of update on where you guys stand on the LCR and NSFR, have you kind of done any kind of backed envelop stuff with respect to those?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So, in relationship to the LCR which is, we\u2019re in excess of the requirement.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">In terms of the NSFR that\u2019s an interesting one because, obviously if you take a step back in NSFR, obviously any rule that\u2019s supportive of good proper industry wide asset liability management, we\u2019re supportive of, it will be very interesting to see how the rule evolves in discussions with the local regulators because as you know in the proposed rule they came out. There really are, there\u2019s some interesting things in there, one being obviously this notion of how transactions get linked. So we\u2019ll have to see what the final determination on that is when we get that from all the regulators, and also obviously the treatment of deposits where different geographies have different legal and regulatory regimes, and in the U.S. obviously we have a restrictive regime in terms of how deposits can be utilized. So, I\u2019d say on the NSFR it\u2019s a bit of a wait and see.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. I would imagine with you guys given your structure that the TLAC is probably not a problem. Is that a fair statement or?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yes, again where we stand today, again at preliminary rule. Right, so I caveat that with all the facts that we\u2019ll have to see where it goes, but that would be our takeaway and our early read.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. And then maybe just broadly on the pipeline record levels, it sounds like one area advisory is clearly strong. Can you comment on the other areas where you\u2019re seeing, is it -- is debt still holding in there given the financing needs for the M&amp;A environment or how is equities doing? How do we think about the pipeline in the different components?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So, as I said the advisory side of the line was really the biggest driver that\u2019s probably not a surprise for you given all the announced transaction to the marketplace. If you sort of look at it year-over-year, equity was down, debt was up a little bit. But it does feel like at least if the marketplace and asset prices can stay here, it feels like a reasonable environment to me for the coming year. But again these things can change on a dime.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Right. Okay. That\u2019s all I got. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thanks so much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Chris Kotowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yes, good morning. Every quarter we go through this and looking at the capital markets business and rates and credit Zigs [ph] and currencies and equity Zags [ph] and you talked about the environment on October versus November and so on. But when I look at the -- kind of the industry revenue totals on an annual basis, they\u2019re incredibly stable and my peer group is probably the same as yours, but its been somewhere between $110 billion and $120 billion of revenues on an annual basis ever since 2011 and we\u2019re probably like 7% or 8% below 11% now. And it just seems to me like the explanation must be that the buy side is becoming increasingly concentrated, larger entities, more resource, and just like you\u2019re able to measure client profitability, they\u2019re able to measure what they pay all the brokers and isn\u2019t the issue more that there is kind of a fixed wallet that the buy side has on an annual basis and that there is not going to be an environment in the future where they pay a whole lot more than they are now?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Well, I guess the -- we should probably have a long philosophical conversation; it probably requires having a glass of wine or beer or something. But I think that the -- I think that you have to really look at these businesses over very, very long periods of time. And so for example when there was growth, lets just say from the period of like 2002 to 2007, I don\u2019t think clients were looking to pay more, I think they were always very, very obsessed around transaction costs. As a matter of fact, the vast reduction in transaction cost for example the equity business actually occurred during that period of growth. And so, we assume that our clients as fiduciaries are always going to focus on transaction cost. I think that less the issue, I think its much more environment driven. We\u2019ve been in a period of near zero global interest rates for an extended period of time, post the financial crises, and so I think our clients are in some respects as a result struggling for their own after production in some cases which translates again into reduced activity, but our clients have always been focused on minimizing transaction cost as they should be [indiscernible] philosophical conversation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Chris Kotowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay. Fair enough. I mean, if I was right, would you manage your business differently than you are?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Its hard for me to imagine any of our businesses and say, look they\u2019re going to stay exactly the same for the next 10 years. So slightly that will be a nice way to live, but our businesses are just more dynamic than that. We think its part of the competitive advantage of Goldman Sachs just responding to the changes. So, I think its going to be dynamic.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Chris Kotowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">All right. Fair enough.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">It is very difficult sitting here today to predict, like it was a couple of years ago, no one would have predicted the way the M&amp;A that we\u2019re experiencing. But not of course it feels very natural, and now people feel like it will extend. I do think this is a case of all of us, this is a natural inclination to extend the most recent set of data that we have. Now, it was going to stay like this for the next 10 years, can you promise me that? Yes, there maybe, we would even push harder of efficiencies. But again we\u2019re positioning for operating leverage and growth.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Chris Kotowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay. All right. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Good morning, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Hi, Brennan.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So, first a quick one on Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo, lots of increase given what happened this quarter and your involvement in the initial deal. Did that have any impact on the results this quarter at all?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So, in terms of [indiscernible] my result this quarter its immaterial. For us, -- and I guess, I would add in terms of the -- on the fixed side of the business not the primary driver. But for us obviously as you have seen in our public commentary we\u2019re very surprised by the Bank of Portugal\u2019s unexpected and very surprising reversal of its prior written decision on this matter. And so, for us really this is really, it\u2019s the matter of our client, it is not about Goldman Sachs, and so we have clients that relied on those representations and so, we remain in active dialogue with the Bank of Portugal and obviously it\u2019s a very fluid situation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay. But is it fair to characterize it as maybe small but in your view immaterial impact?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I would say not a primary driver of FICC, but obviously in FICC.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">It is obviously part of the revenue decline.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Got it. And then thinking about your physical business on the commodity side, you guys are one of the few left. We\u2019re seeing given some of the dynamics there in that market but improving -- and improving bed for storage, how are you seeing that play out in your physical business as we move forward from here?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">So, we always think of the -- that our focus in commodities is really and we used to think about is divide into two things, investments that we make in terms of things like metro which we sold during the course of the quarter. When we purchased metro, it was always purchased with the notion that we would add value to the enterprise and then ultimately sell metro. That was always part of the strategic design. In terms of our commodity franchise, which we\u2019re as you know very committed to. The focus there is on the hedging of commodity price exposures and working with all those clients globally whether they be corporates or investors. And so that\u2019s really how we think about the strategy. Obviously ownership of physical commodities is getting -- we think is actually a good review by the Federal Reserve. We are very focused on safety and soundness. We think its perfectly understandable that they\u2019re doing the same. But that\u2019s our strategy in commodities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay. And then last one also just on sort of oil. Thinking about the drop here in oil and your M&amp;A franchise, energy has been a pretty meaningful part of the M&amp;A market last few years. What sort of near-term and then maybe a bit longer term impact you anticipate the drop in oil would have to M&amp;A activity from here?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Well I think big picture, the drop in oil which really started in June but obviously it started getting a lot of attention in the fourth quarter. I think at the highest level a lot has been written about the tradeoffs between near-term impact on markets, but obviously a big tailwind in terms of expense reduction and a benefit for the consumer. And so, we talk to our economist net-net, as you\u2019ve seen from us, we think the price decline if it stays here is a tailwind for global economic growth. As it relates specifically to the industry, if we go through a period of sustained declined prices around this level, then clearly its going to put certain parts of the industry under stress. There will be opportunities to help those clients, work through those stresses. There will be opportunities to deploy new hedging strategies, there will be potentially merger opportunities as the organization works through what is really a case of excess supply. So again, its very early days and these things tend to play out over months and years when you get these kind of price declines. But clearly clients will be looking for advice from Goldman Sachs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay, but no specific commentary as far as the M&amp;A outlook is concerned and the impact there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">No, I think it\u2019s a bit early. And I think it will be very specific to certain situations in terms of how we work through the cycle.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay. Thanks for the color, Harvey</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Hi, Harvey. Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Hi. How are you?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Doing well. Thanks. So, I just had one follow-up question on the capital discussion. Maybe looking at it from a different angle, the presentation you guys had given a couple of months ago is extraordinarily informative. Certainly help us think about all the different constraints that you\u2019re managing to. But from your perspective given that your business adjustments that you plan on making are merely going to be tactical at this juncture, and given our understanding of the constraints and the final rules and where they sit today, what do you believe your spot or required capital levels are at the moment to support your business?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">So, I don\u2019t think we should underemphasize the word tactical. I think tactical really means; there are no big strategic challenges over here in terms of businesses that we need to dispose of at this stage. Really we\u2019re quite pleased with the strength of our franchise businesses, and so I wouldn\u2019t underestimate, I wouldn\u2019t mistake tactical for a lack of focus or a lack of opportunity. As I said I think its really a prerequisite to running the businesses now in terms of having a very focused tactical strategy and I appreciate your comments about the presentation we gave. In terms of how we think about long <strong>gone [ph] 15<sup>th</sup> (0:18)</strong> capital levels, obviously the capital levels aren\u2019t finalized. So maybe we should just talk about today's context. In today's context and we\u2019ll see what happens with the finalization of the G-SIB buffers. But in today's context we would be at a minimum of 8.5% and we had a stated buffer of 9.5%. We have been spending time looking at the buffer. I think the 1% buffer probably seems on the high end to us. We\u2019re not going to spend a lot of time on it until we see the final rules. Did that get to your question?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">It does. But presumably given what we know today whether its about CCAR being binding or the Feds latest proposal recognizing that there could be additional changes going forward that 8.5% plus whatever buffer you didn\u2019t appropriate is probably not where your required capital or target is ultimately going to shake out. Presumably it will be higher than that, and not just for you but for industry peers as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Yes, I would agree with that. You didn\u2019t ask the question but again this is a very early read of the proposal that\u2019s out, and so subject to change. So caveat it accordingly. But our early read and interpretation of the documents out there that it would add 1% for us. And so what you said earlier I think is the more important thing which is in terms of a binding constraints, the binding constraint for us is CCAR. And so, we\u2019ll continue to focus very much on all aspects of the capital ratios. But for us the binding constraint has proven to be CCAR.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay. Maybe just one quick follow-up. Is it CCAR risk based or leverage based ratios. It felt as though in the last exam it was leveraged. I didn\u2019t know if you felt that, that would potentially evolve as CCAR changes over the next couple of years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Yes, so -- look I think the Federal Reserve has said CCAR was going to be dynamic and so we\u2019ll see how they made changes and their test has proven to be dynamic. We can only tell you it was constraining last year as you saw publicly because of the leverage test and then you saw subsequently take certain actions and that obviously influenced our activity around the balance sheet and how we had to think about re-pricing that capital.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">All right. Harvey that\u2019s really helpful. Thank you for taking my questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Good to hear from you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Good morning, Harvey. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple of quick administrative follow-ups. Just following up on the prior discussion, have you provided or given any thought just sort of the short-term wholesale funding buffer and how that might effect your future ratios and if there is any meaningful consideration being given within that calculation for the maturity even within the short-term bucket?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">So, as I said before just so we\u2019re clear to everybody, so our preliminary expectation and again I caveat that because this rule is very fluid and its in formation only would add an incremental 100 basis points to our G-SIB buffer.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">In terms of how we\u2019re going -- again I think its really most important for takeaway for everyone to understand the framework for how we think about managing the capital against multiple constraints. So, any time in a new regulatory regime any time we\u2019re deploying our balance sheets you have to be able to think through multiple lenses and view things through multiple lenses, that\u2019s why we created the framework that we discussed at the conference in November which basically ascribes a waiting system to that and that gives us a consistent lens to look at things like the use of balance sheet and the supplementary leverage ratio, stresses from CCAR, Basel III standardized, Basel III advanced. And you have to look at all those things individually at the same time. So, capital management, but the regulators have done an immense amount of work to increase capital levels and make the system safer and as a market participant we need to develop technologies and our philosophy and approach to basically work within that framework and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">That\u2019s helpful. And then a question in terms of operating or operational RWA, a number of your peers mentioned that they had increased operating or operational RWA this quarter. Was that true for Goldman as well?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">No, during the course of the quarter -- from the third quarter to the fourth quarter they were basically essentially flat down a little bit.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Okay. Thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin Ryan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Hi. Good morning, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin Ryan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Just a couple of quick follow-ups from me as well here, so just on the investment banking backlog comments I\u2019m glad to hear that the backlog is where it is. But debt underwriting specifically can you speak to maybe some of the puts and takes of the high bar in recent years and corporate issuance that, that maybe tough to match versus the opportunity that you\u2019re speaking about with M&amp;A related financings and how much of an offset that could represent?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">So of all the things that I\u2019ve been I think really that I\u2019m predicting over the last couple of years, its been the annual question about what we think debt underwriting is going to do in the next year. I think you could easily take a position over the last two years that maybe debt underwriting will be lower than the previous year. But the markets have remained robust. M&amp;A activity can be a significant driver of financing activity. I think if rates stay low and the markets are stable and spreads are tight, I think you could see a very reasonable environment. I think if you see the contrary then obviously it will have an impact on activity, and very difficult to predict from here. I mean rates are very low. So for many issuance its going to look quite attractive over the course of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin Ryan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Okay. Thanks for the color. And then just on comp, some of your peers are talking about changing their methodology around different comp, and I know you don\u2019t specifically disclose level of differed comp, but in a roughly flat year for reported comp, is it reasonable to assume that differed comp is also roughly flat or is there any additional qualitative detail you can provide around how you guys are thinking about the mix there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">So, I think the better way to think about that is, we\u2019ve been consistent in our compensation philosophy for a number of years in terms of really ensuring that our employees and it goes up as you go up through the seniority of the firm through to the partners that you hold a significant amount of equity and there\u2019s been no change of philosophy over the last several years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin Ryan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">That\u2019s fair enough. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Your next question is from the line of Douglas Sipkin with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Douglas Sipkin</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Yes, thank you. Good morning. Two questions, first on fake and I\u2019m just curious for your guys perspective and opinion Harvey. I mean, given the sort of change in liquidity that\u2019s come to these markets in the last, lets call it five or six years since the credit crises. I mean, is your guys position that credit is maybe a little bit more vulnerable to smaller shocks given the lack of liquidity, i.e. I guess energy feels like it was the catalyst really for credit to weaken, but its still only, I mean, its bigger but its only like 14%, 15% of high yield. So, is it more pronounced now credit events given the lack of liquidities at your guy\u2019s perspective or it was just kind of a tough quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">It will be very difficult to anticipate whether or not this is kind of a new credit regime in terms of liquidity trading or it is -- these are sort of one off factors. Its always hard to assess that when you\u2019ve had multiple years of timing credit spreads, very low default rates. I will say when you look to the data I don\u2019t have it on top of my head particularly in Europe where liquidity was little challenged in the third quarter and then it got worse in the fourth quarter. I think because if market moves in terms of price movements they were pretty significant. More significant than you would have thought in terms of the underlying credit itself. And so clearly liquidity played a role in terms of the degree of price movement. But I wouldn\u2019t say at this stage you could draw any firm conclusions from that in terms of any long-term structural changes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Douglas Sipkin</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Okay, great. And then shifting to asset management, obviously a great year for you guys. I was little surprised to see sort of the fixed income bucket on the flow side a little flattish for the fourth quarter and I was wondering, did you guys close some strategies or did something change just given how strong you guys have done obviously with performance and some of your competitors struggling throughout the year, and it still looked like fourth quarter industry wide that phenomena still played out. So I was just curious as to why you guys didn\u2019t sort of have the same flow dynamic you had throughout the first three quarters?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Yes, I even had a chance to dig through sort of competitor results and maybe get more transparency over time than we do, but when we look at it over the course of the year which is really how we think about it. We took in $74 billion of long-term flows of which you highlighted $58 billion came in at fixed income. This could just be the timing of how various mandates that are rewarded arrive. We feel quite good about our performance and our ability to continue to gather assets on the back of that performance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Douglas Sipkin</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Okay. Thanks. Yes, I just want to call out that you had mentioned that you had 754 million of litigation and regulatory expense in the period. Just want to make sure that, that\u2019s all related to investigations and not compliance costs in there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">So that\u2019s all -all-- those are litigation related reserves that we access every quarter and we take a quarterly based on information we have on individual and specific cases. That\u2019s not a compensation build or an expense related to additional compliance people or something. I\u2019m not sure, I understood the question. So I\u2019m just trying to clarify it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Yes, that\u2019s the question. So I mean if those investigations go away is that kind of with the expense savings or be it was kind of more of a normalized level of litigation [ph]?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">As we work through legacy costs, ultimately that is the case.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Okay. And will you be able to put most of the major investigation behind you in 2015?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">So in terms of litigation, you have seen us obviously make progress in the third quarter, we settled with the FHFA. I would encourage you to really dig through our disclosure where we give very vast disclosure around all facets of litigation and status.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Okay, thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Your next question comes from the line of your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Good morning. Please check your line to see if you\u2019re on mute.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Hey, Eric.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Hi, how are you? That\u2019s only like the fifth time I\u2019ve done that in this earning cycle. So you -- I just wanted to follow-up on the RWA discussion and see Harvey, if you could just help me kind of understand what the puts and takes of it might be over the course of this year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Are you saying on a going forward basis?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Yes, on a going forward basis, again I would say there is two things that underscore. The first is we\u2019re going to continue to be very focused on further rule compliance and being efficient about the capital. But a lot of it will be driven by client activity. Obviously, we are well positioned from a capital perspective. And so, we really want to stay front footed at as we to the extent to which clients demand are capital. And so we feel well positioned. Hard for me to tell you what those demands are going to be as we sit here in January, but we feel very well positioned,</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">And in terms of the very broad based reduction in assets that you undertook over the course of this year. Is that -- should we view that as being largely completed or is that something that is still under consideration for you over the course of this coming year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">So immediately\\ we have no media plans to reduce the balance sheet from here, but again that's going to be subject to review continuously. And so again, it will be dynamic. If we feel like we are not getting the proper returns, then we will look to reduce. Its really just about discipline, at the same time making sure that we invest strategically for the long run.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Correct. And then, if I guess get a transition for a moment and in terms of the M&amp;A pipeline, could you give us any sense of the complexion of it is that primarily in country as it more across board. Are we seeing any changes, I guess, the real question is are we singing any changes in terms of the complexion of M&amp;A activity, relative to what we\u2019ve seen over the -- this past year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">I mean, look in terms of year-over-year as you would expect the growth specifically in terms of the backlog, it really came work from Americas and Europe and it was really down in terms of Asia. That\u2019s how I describe a geographic measure, which is probably doesn\u2019t surprising.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">And I mean what is the -- I guess I'm trying to understand is the strategic rational changing at all among corporate Boards and terms of growth orientation versus cost savings orientation or any kind of that kind of strategic level discussion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">I think that its, when we talked to our M&amp;A team, what they will tell you is very industry specific. It can be geographic, but the moment level is quite high and so I guess when you look back at it, I said earlier there were a number of folks who would say look we never see M&amp;A again a couple of years ago and that was just where we want in a cycle, but I think that in a world which generally increasingly stable, low growth, but stable CEO\u2019s and boards will look to grow revenues and a strategic opportunity. The one thing that we\u2019ve seen as part of this past cycle, driven by strategics is large transactions tend to spin-off lots of activity in particular sectors. So I don\u2019t know when you talked to our M&amp;A team. I don\u2019t know they would say, look this is all cost driven or this is all top line driven. It\u2019s a mix of factors that will drive action. The momentum feels quite good.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Your next question is from the line of Richard Bove with Rafferty Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Richard Bove</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Good morning. This is kind of a broad question. So I apologize, after a very long call, but over the past couple of days having getting questions on both sides of Goldman Sachs, if you will. While in terms of structure, one is given everything hat you\u2019ve mentioned about capital and constraints on the business placed by the regulators. Should in fact Goldman Sachs be broken up? And if not, why should it be kept together? The other side being asked, given the high level of cyclicality in the two main businesses of the company, should Goldman Sachs make a major acquisition either an asset management company, or a wealth management company, which we give the company a recurring stream of revenue to eliminate some of the [indiscernible] volatility and its revenues and earnings. I don\u2019t know is it the same question basically which is what should the structure, Goldman Sachs be over the next 4 to 5 years?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Yes, so it\u2019s a good question and obviously there has been a lot of focus on there. So, I guess, we first have to say -- so, if anything what\u2019s changed today because I think prior to the crisis there was a belief that obviously it benefits to scale and you can get scale and you can have synergies. I think the change that people are focused on now is obviously there is a cost, a capital cost that the regulators are putting on side and so its very natural that the question that you're asking. Now, for GS, I would highlight a couple of things. First of all, we\u2019re just significantly smaller than many of the other firms and our balance sheet at $850 plus billion. Many of our competitors are more than twice our size and we\u2019ve 34,000 employees and they may have hundreds of thousands of employees, and so we are smaller and we are less complex. And as a result, we're somewhat simpler. So what I would say is when we look at the collection of businesses that we have, the way we answer the synergy question is first and foremost through the eyes of the clients. Do we think we provide more value to our clients by having a collection of businesses together or not? It doesn't matter to us when in any given quarter the stock markets may be not valuing one of our businesses as perfectly as we would like it to be. It's really a question of over the long run can we drive shareholder value by having that benefit to our clients. So let's take fixed income and equity as one example. In an environment where its technology driven and the clients increasingly get larger, you need to scale across those businesses. We started running those businesses as a collective shortly after 2000 I think. And so the ability to deliver one technology platform across those businesses have one risk management system, all those things provide us with scale and we think we\u2019re able to execute better. It then feeds into our ability to adapt and develop technology tools around capital, and hopefully we are able to perform well in terms of deploying the firms\u2019 capital. When you think about investment banking, you bundle in. Think about the merger business today. And what we\u2019re able to do for our clients by having the ability to commit the capital and actually deliver to the capital markets and connect investors with issuers. Well, all of these things are very synergistic. Our private wealth business, with our banking business, with our asset management business, these are all things that we think we have synergies in. Now, in terms of smaller or bigger, I think it's going to be environment driven for us. You saw us, you have seen us shrink the balance sheet pretty dramatically thinking you have known us for long time, we used to run at 1.1, 1.2 trillion. We\u2019ve been around 900 and now well below that for quite a while and so you\u2019re going to see us be dynamic about this. If we thought, we could drive more value for our clients and get more scale then we would consider things. I will say now it\u2019s harder obviously because there is the explicit pricing end, if you want to call it tax of incremental capital. You have to be very confident that you can get those synergies in that scale. That answer okay, given the breadth of your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Richard Bove</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Yes, I think it makes a great deal of sense. What about the other foot side of the question, which is where can you come up with a recurring revenue stream that would lower the volatility in your current business mix.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">It\u2019s funny. I can\u2019t help myself big. I know you say there a lot of volatility in our current revenue mix, but we have actually produced $34 billion in revenues for three years running. And we\u2019ve grown the ROE and we shrunk the balance sheet and we\u2019ve increased the pre-tax and we replaced $2.5 billion of revenues that didn\u2019t disappear because of volatility, it disappeared because we sold them. So I\u2019m not telling you its going to always be this stable, but touch wood it feels pretty stable last couple of years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Richard Bove</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Okay. Thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Your next question is from the line of Andrew Limb with Societe Generale. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Andrew Limb</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Hi. Good morning, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Hi. Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Andrew Limb</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">I\u2019ve just got a -- good morning. I\u2019ve got a question on the trading book review that mostly the Basel committee is undertaking and whether you could give anymore color on what kind of impacts it might have on the industry on an absolute basis, and also how you stack up relative to your peers?</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">So on the trading book review we think it\u2019s very important obviously and we\u2019re in active dialogue. There\u2019s been the QIS and -- so again its very early on that. So I don\u2019t have any specific comments on the trading book review. I think what I would say is that, and again I think you have to give credit and kudos to the regulators. They have been incredibly productive over the last several years. If we paused a list out for all the regulatory changes, its incredible in terms of the impact on capital, liquidity, trading, top execution facilities and so, one of the things I think we all need to consider is market participants, and when I say that I mean clients, folks like ourselves and regulators is we need to maybe at least think about pausing a bit and digesting the impact of these rules. There\u2019s no doubt that these rules make the system stronger and safer as I said before. I do think there\u2019s a benefit to absorbing how they interact over the long periods of time, because you can't get all those benefits without some cost. We can't necessarily always identify those costs immediately. And so that would be my very high level comment on that. But I don\u2019t have any specific comments on any proposed revisions for the rules.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Andrew Limb</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">And is it something that you\u2019re running internally just to see what the impact is at the moment or is that too early to do that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">So, we\u2019re very consistent on our philosophy and yes in terms of proposed rules. It follows a very normal course protocol for us. We work as constructively as we can with the regulators in terms of trying to provide them with data and dialogue on the impact of overrule. So we\u2019re always active participants and we dedicate a lot of time and people and system and math to the QIS as they come out whether with any rule and we always try and be an active participant in terms of giving good balanced feedback to the regulators in terms of the benefits and cause of any proposed rule, which is very early in this potential rewrite. It\u2019s just too early to comment on it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Andrew Limb</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Okay. And then just carrying on to another regulation the NSFR. I know you said that was early as well, but any thoughts about how that might impinge on your prime brokerage business and in terms of like incumberment to your balance sheet assets?</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Now again too early to tell. We\u2019ll see how it ultimately evolves when we get a local regulation. As I said, a big part of the discussion will be around the treatment of deposits. But look, I think what you\u2019re going to see the world do as they adjust is all firms, not just Goldman Sachs. All firms will look for what we\u2019ll call net stable funding ratio funding, whatever that ends up being defined as. And so, we\u2019ll see how the rule evolves. But look, we\u2019ll adapt. You\u2019ve seen us do it whether it\u2019s the Basel III ratio, the supplementary leverage ratio, all these things. We\u2019ll just -- we still need to see a rule.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Andrew Limb</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">Okay. And then just one final question. Is that target SLR that you\u2019re aiming for heading into the CCAR at all?</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">No. At this stage not. As you saw into the SLR right at this stage, as you saw we\u2019re at 5%. That\u2019s up about 80 basis points in the course of the year, so now we\u2019re complying with 2018. One of the things is we\u2019ll continue to review this. There are whole lots of factors that could improve that ratio from here, but again we\u2019ll be assessing all of our buffers as we get the final capital rules. Again we all interact, right? So, you really want to get to a point of stability of rule making and then you can really set the parameters and dial them in more tightly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Andrew Limb</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">Great. Thanks a lot.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">Thank you. I appreciate you dialing in.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">At this time there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">So, hey everyone. Since there are no more questions, I just want to take a moment to thank all you for joining the call. Hopefully myself and other members of senior management will see many of you in the coming months. If there is any additional questions arise, please don\u2019t hesitate to give Dane a call, otherwise enjoy the rest of your day and a long weekend and look forward to speaking with you our first quarter earnings call coming up in April. Take care everyone. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs fourth quarter 2014 earnings conference call.

My name is Dennis and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today, January 16, 2014. Thank you. Mr. Holmes, you may begin your conference.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Dane Holmes</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Today\u2019s call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm\u2019s belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain and outside of the firm\u2019s control. The firm\u2019s actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm\u2019s future results, please see the description of risk factors in our current annual report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended December 2012.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our investment banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk weighted assets and Global Core Excess. And you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that is posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com. This audio cast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced, or rebroadcast without our consent.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Our Chief Financial Officer, Harvey Schwartz, will now review the firm\u2019s results. Harvey?</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thanks, Dane and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I\u2019ll walk you through our full year and fourth quarter results then I am obviously happy to answer any questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Let\u2019s start with the annual results. We had firm wide net revenues of $34.2 billion, net earnings of $8 billion, earnings per diluted share of $15.46 and a return on common equity of 11%. This is a solid result and a modest improvement over last year\u2019s performance despite what at times was a difficult operating environment. With regard to the fourth quarter, net revenues were $8.8 billion, net earnings were $2.3 billion and earnings per diluted share were $4.60.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">In looking at the broader operating environment, many of the global themes had dominated 2012, for example, improving economic debt in the United States, central bank activity and political uncertainty continued into 2013. Starting with U.S. economic data, we saw relatively consistent improvement over the course of the year reported GDP consensus estimates in each of the last two quarters. U.S. unemployment rate declined by over 100 basis points to 6.7%, it\u2019s lowest level since October of 2008 and housing prices as reflected by the Case-Shiller Housing Price Index increased by 14% through October. 2013 represented a slow, steady improvement in the U.S. economy, which had roughly a quarter of global GDP naturally served at a stabilizing and positive improvements on global market sentiment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">2013 was also marked by significant Central Bank activity. In Japan the Central Bank announced unprecedented monetary risk [ph] and was to achieve stated inflation targets. Japanese credit spreads tightened and the yen weekend throughout the year. In addition the Nikkei enjoyed it's largest annual game since 1972.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In the U.S. initial commentary from the Federal Reserve about tapering at bond buying program ultimately translated into a December announcement of a $10 billion monthly reduction in the reprogram leading the marketplace to contemplate the world without quantitative easing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Finally political risk and uncertainty were constant during the year, starting with the Italian elections in the first quarter, continued unrest in the Middle East and the 16 day U.S. government shutdown. This created an environment that requires qualities to constantly reassess their outlook for the global economy. For example what are the implications of Central Bank activity on the global economy? Individual regional economies and specific industry sectors? What are the pushes and poles associated with monetary policy versus fiscal policy? Rising rates and tapering a head win for the U.S. economic recovery or return to a more traditional supply and demand driven economy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Not surprisingly our client\u2019s activity fluctuated over the course of the year as they were constantly digesting new information. When you boil it all down the 2013 environment it's just one where the world took two steps forward followed by one step back. A dynamic which you could see reflected in both price movements in the markets and client activity. To sum it up while we wouldn\u2019t characterize the last two years as a normal cyclical environment given all the items I previously listed it shouldn\u2019t be lost on us that the long term trend is slowly and steadily improving.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Now I will discuss each of our businesses, in invest banking we produced fourth quarter net revenues of $1.7 billion up 47% from the third quarter. Three factors drove the increase, a robust IPO calendar, higher completed M&amp;A volumes and debt financing activity that remained strong. For the full year investment banking net revenues was $6 billion up 22% from 2012 on the back of solid underwriting activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Breaking down the components in investment banking advisory revenues were 585 million in the fourth quarter. The 38% increase relative to the third quarter reflects the increase in industry wide completed M&amp;A. Goldman Sachs continue to be ranked first in worldwide announced and completed M&amp;A for 2013. We advise on a number of significant transactions that closed during the fourth quarter including Vivendi, $8.2 billion sale of it's controlling stake in Activision. Ingersoll-Rand\u2019s $5.3 billion Allegion and a $2.9 billion sale off Saks to Hudson\u2019s Bay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We also advise on a number of important transaction that were announced during the fourth quarter including Sysco\u2019s $8.2 billion acquisition of U.S. Foods, ViroPharma\u2019s $4.2 billion sale to Shire and Deutsche Telekom\u2019s 2 million euro sale of Scout 24 to Hellman &amp; Friedman.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Moving to underwriting net revenues were record $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter up 52% sequentially at equity issuance improved significantly. Equity underwriting revenues of 622 million were more than double our third quarter results largely due to an increase in IPOs and convertibles. Goldman Sachs continues to be ranked first in worldwide equity, equity related and common stock offerings for 2013. Debt underwriting revenues increased 9% to 511 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">During the fourth quarter we actively supported our clients financing needs participating in Darling International, $2.7 billion debt and equity offering. Twitter\u2019s $2.1 billion IPO and Moncler\u2019s $1.1 billion IPO. Our investment banking backlog further improved from third quarter levels which you will recall were already at our highest level in five years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Turning to institutional client services which comprises both our FICC and equity businesses. Net revenues were 3.4 billion in the fourth quarter up 19% compared to the more challenging environment in the third quarter. For the full year 15.7 billion of net revenues were down 13% relative to 2012. FIC client execution net revenues were 1.7 billion in the fourth quarter or 1.9 billion excluding DVA losses of a 163 million. Excluding DVA, revenues were up 46% sequentially. In particular, currency revenues increased significantly compared to a challenging third quarter. Credit was up on stronger client activity that was supported by tighter credit spreads and solid issuance trends. Commodities revenues were largely flat sequentially and remains a threat by lower volatility in client activity levels. Rates and mortgages declined as client activity levels remained low.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">For the full year, fixed client execution net revenues were $8.7 billion or $8.9 billion excluding $220 million in DVA losses. Excluding DVA, revenues were down 14% relative to 2012 at macro uncertainty particularly around central bank policies and lower volatility levels impacted client risk appetite and activity. The decline was more pronounced for rates and mortgages.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In equities, which includes, equities client execution, commissions and fees and security services, net revenues for the fourth quarter were $1.7 billion, up 4% sequentially and included $43 million in DVA losses. Equities client execution revenues increased 9% sequentially to $598 million. Commissions and fees were $747 million, up 3% relative to the third quarter supported by rising equity markets and strong issuance trends. Security services generated net revenues of $337 million largely consistent with the third quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">For the full year, equities produced net revenues of $7.1 billion, down 14% relative to 2012. This decline was due to the sale of our Americas reinsurance business in 2013 and the sale of our hedge fund administration business in 2012. In our equity business during 2013, stronger performance in cash products was offset by weaker derivative revenues. Turning to risk, average daily VAR in the fourth quarter was $81 million, down from $84 million in the third quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Moving on to our investing and lending activities, collectively these businesses produced net revenues of $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of $1.4 billion, primarily reflecting company specific events, including initial public offerings and gains in public equity investments. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $423 million and benefited from net gains and net interest income. Other revenues of $234 million include the firm\u2019s consolidated investments. For the full year, investing and lending generated net revenues of $7 billion driven by $3.9 billion in gains from equity securities, $1.9 billion of net revenues from debt securities and loans and $1.1 billion of other investments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In investment management, we reported fourth quarter net revenues of $1.6 billion, up 31% from the third quarter primarily as a result of $333 million in incentive fees generated largely from the firm\u2019s alternative asset products. Management and other fees were up 5% sequentially of $1.1 billion. For the full year, investment management net revenues were $5.5 billion, up 5% from 2012 on stronger management and other fees, which benefited from growth in assets under supervision.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">During the fourth quarter, assets under supervision increased $51 billion to a record $1.04 trillion. This growth was driven by long-term net inflows of $13 billion largely in fixed income assets. We also had market appreciation of $20 billion largely in equity assets. On a full year basis, $41 billion of long-term net inflows and $40 billion of market appreciation drove these record levels of assets under supervision. When it comes to investment management, we all know that performance is critical. We are intensely focused on delivering returns for our investment management clients and have seen improvement in our multi-year performance. The $41 billion of long-term net inflows in 2013 were the highest annually since the onset of the crisis. We will continue to focus on delivering performance for our clients and have confidence that the rest will follow in due course.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Now, let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as benefits, decreased 3% to $12.6 billion for 2013 and translated into a compensation to net revenues ratio of 36.9%. Fourth quarter non-compensation expenses were $3 billion, 40% higher than the third quarter and up slightly compared with the fourth quarter of 2012. Other expenses were significantly higher reflecting net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings of 561 million more than 400 million higher than the third quarter. Depreciation and amortization included a 196 million impairment charges primarily related to consolidated investments. Finally the fourth quarter also included a $155 million donation to Goldman Sachs Gives our donor-advised charitable fund.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">For the full year non-compensation expenses were down 2%. Total staff at year end was approximately 32,900 up 2% from year end 2012. Our effective tax rate was 31.5% for 2013. Before moving on to capital it's worth taking a step back to review our improvement operating efficiency over the past few years. In the first half of 2011 we announced a comprehensive expense initiative. If you look at our cost structure this year versus 2010 before we launched our expense initiative. Total expenses are lower by $3.8 billion. As a result our pretax margin in 2013 increased a 140 basis points to it's highest level in the last four years, this despite having $5 billion less in revenues.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Delivering more operating efficiency is never easy and requires a real focus on striking the right balance. By balance I mean making sure that our actions positions us to deliver for all of our constituents. Our clients, our regulators, our employees, the broader financial system and of course for our shareholders. We believe it's early and ongoing focus on our expense structure has not only benefited recent performance but more importantly also serves as a basis for better results in the future particularly as the opportunity set expands.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Now regarding capital, we repurchased 8.5 million shares of common stock for total cost of $1.4 billion during the fourth quarter. For the full year we repurchased 39.3 million shares for a total cost of $6.2 billion. With respect to our regulatory capital ratios our Basel III Tier I common ratio on a fully loaded basis was 9.8% using the advance approach. Under the standardized approach our ratio was 9.2% of course it's important to note that our transitional ratios are both more than a 100 basis points higher. Risk weighted assets are on the advance approach are approximately $595 billion, $350 billion in credit risk, $160 billion in market risk and about $85 billion in operational risk. Our estimate for the proposed supplementary leverage ratio under U.S. rules remains approximately 5% for the firm and approximately 6% for the bank. These were our best estimates subject to change depending on regulatory clarifications.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Of course last month we also gained regulatory clarity on the Volcker Rule. Most importantly the final Volcker Rule explicitly permitted market making, lending and investing on balance sheets. Regulators permitted these activities given the essential that they plan supporting healthy capital markets and economic growth. Although we only received a finalized Volcker Rule last month. We have obviously been preparing to comply with certain portions of the rule for nearly three years. In 2010 we began closing down our proprietary trading operations, specifically Goldman Sachs principal strategies and our Global Macro Proprietary Trading desk.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In addition we announced in 2012 our intention to redeem certain hedge fund investments. Since 2012 we have redeemed approximately $2.2 billion of hedge fund investments and we will continue to redeem our interests. Now that we have a final rule the first thing that we did was established a Volcker implementation team comprised of senior leaders with expertise across a wide variety of controlling business functions. They are focused on making sure that we\u2019re in the position to effectively and efficiently meet the numerous requirements outlined under this new and intense compliance regime.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In summary as I mentioned earlier while we\u2019re still not at what I would describe that normalized cyclical environment, the underlying macro trend is being improving. To maximize our opportunity set and drive shareholder value we need to continue to focus first and foremost on our clients. Their activity and our connectivity to their needs is our highest priority. We need to continue to recruit and retain a high caliber and dedicated global workforce. We need to leverage our technology expertise to adapt to new regulations and evolving market structures and we need to remain focused on improving our efficiency both from a cost and a capital perspective. Our goal is not only to enhance returns in the current environment, but more importantly over the long-term to position this firm for significant operating leverage as the opportunities that improves. We believe that we have the competitive position, the diversity of businesses, the caliber of people and the institutional will to capture and maximize these opportunities as they present themselves for the benefit of you, our shareholders.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Thank you again for dialing in. And now I am happy to answer any questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p5\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">(Operator Instructions) Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with ISI. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Good morning, Glenn.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Good morning. Just a quickie follow-up. I heard all your comments on Volker just making sure the hedging component, you mentioned about market-making lending investment, anything different on the verb it\u2019s related to hedging in your ability to just manage risk across the desks?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">No. We don\u2019t see anything in the rule that prevents us from continuing to hedge. I think the early concern before the final rule came out with its reference to portfolio hedging, but we hedge within the business as there is no hedging at the firm wide level, so hedges are hedges.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Good, good. Also the Fed recently just put out a quick whitepaper that had a testimony on commodities, I think a lot of that was expected, but I am curious to get your update as to what\u2019s on plans for the business, but there was a piece in that that threw me for a loop a little bit on the merchant banking and I wasn\u2019t sure if it relates to your entire merchant banking business or merchant banking within commodities businesses. So, if you could get quick thoughts on that, I know it just came out, that would be helpful?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">No, fine. It\u2019s an important question. So, as you know, the commodity business has been an important business for Goldman Sachs and quite important for our clients for an extended period of time. I think to simplify it I would break down the business growing into two parts. There is \u2013 our activity there relate to investing activities. And then there is our franchise business where we are working with clients in a market-making activity. Then in that function, we are essentially providing the same services as anyone would, working with a Treasurer or a CFO on any risk that they would be hedging. So, in terms of a corporate treasurer, if they need to manage their exposure to dollar yen, they will work with us in our currency business. And if they need to manage their exposure to a cost input in commodities, they will work with us on the same hedging profile. So that\u2019s a high level as the business breaks down. And on the investing side, we\u2019ve been an important provider of capital and working with our clients to a capital intensive industry. I think it relates to the whitepaper, I think it\u2019s a good step. It\u2019s another step in the regulatory process, where people reviewing the businesses. I think the questions make sense. These are things that we consider all the time in our businesses from the safety incentive [ph] perspective. So I think it\u2019s a healthy exercise and we will work the regulators, but certainly no change in strategy from Goldman Sachs as it relates to commodity. It\u2019s just too important business for our clients.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">I appreciate that. The merchant banking component within that paper, it seemed to be chucked in at the end, is that questioning whether we limit bank holding companies\u2019 ability to do merchant banking in totality or it\u2019s within the commodity space?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Don\u2019t know. Don\u2019t have any special insight in terms of that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">I know it\u2019s early.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So we will see as it moves along. I don\u2019t want to minimize it, but it\u2019s a question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Glenn Sure - ISI</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Okay. Moving on to FEA, you guys have been doing this for a while, some banks are catching up. I am just curious on if more of the competition is accounting for the credit spreads and pricing, does that make the business on more equal footing, does it \u2013 is it that do you envision an impact on the actual pricing of the business than the competitive landscape?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">No. Obviously, there has been a lot of attention to FEA over the last couple of days just so obviously you are aware of this, Glenn, but we incorporated FEA into our pricing methodologies back in 2010. And if you take the step back for a second, just from the general risk management perspective in the way that we think about risk parameters and inputs, if we identify our cost or parameter we try incorporate as quickly as possible and so we adopted this in 2010. In terms of it's implications I think there is probably two one is really more for you and folks on your side of the table which is obviously it has some degree of distorting effect when you look at things like revenue market share and it's one reason why we look at revenue market share but we don\u2019t emphasize it as much as you do necessarily because these pricing inconsistencies they can lead to anomalies in certain points in time. I think the more important issue really in terms of how we run the business is the one that you have mentioned which is regardless of the particular assay class is, if one firm I say Goldman Sachs in this particularly case ends being the one from that\u2019s actually pricing our parameter and all the other competitors aren\u2019t. It leads to challenging conversations with the clients because you look like an outlier and so you know to get to the gut of your question the extent to which the playing field is level and everyone is pricing on the same terms and managing the risk the same way, obviously we prefer that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">But in the end we\u2019re always going to prioritize the risk management over things like market share.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">The question I get asked most often when I talk to clients about you guys is how you can improve the ROE over time? And you know to be fair the 11% for the year is above that appears especially if you adjust for the business mix but as we think about you know obviously revenue is a driver but if revenue stays kind of in this type of environment what can you do to optimize the capital and there is still some expense opportunities even after all the progress you\u2019ve made today?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So if you go back again a couple of years ago you know we really were focused on building operating leverage into the enterprise and I think in the end of last year you saw that reflected in the response sort of our performance with a 10.7% ROE and this year you\u2019re seeing increasing operating leverage but obviously it's important to see the back to back consistency. Now we\u2019re always looking to be more efficient. We can certainly do things you know far from corporate [ph] we can certainly do things in terms of capital efficiency and expenses and we\u2019re constantly looking at how to leverage technology particularly as we get more visibility into finalized rules so we can adapt. I would say you know my comments before about finding balance. As we have been doing this the most important thing is we want to make sure we\u2019re well positioned for our clients when revenue opportunities do look better and I think you see it kind of across the board in terms of market share and investment banking, reachable [ph] presence, growth and asset management all across of our businesses you\u2019re seeing it we will try to find that balance and look we always get these things right but that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">And I guess as a follow-up, this is just a general question for you and the industry that when people look at the fixed income environment I think there is a lot of focus in all the structural changes occurring and concerned that there will be revenue pressures but I also get the sense that there hasn\u2019t been maybe an entire adjustment to that franchise or to the platform as people wait to see what all the new rules are and kind of when Fed that of buying bonds what happens to that market? So I\u2019m just wondering like is that an area where there might be some capacity adjustments because if you see for the industry as a whole?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">It's a really good question; I\u2019m going to break it down in two part. On the first part in terms of the impact of regulation I think it's early you know we haven't even really seen the launch of things like swap execution facilities and the real impact is in ultimately how market structures adjust. I do think though that the big impact from a regulation perspective is the fact that the entire industry is carrying more capital and I think implicating [ph] in your question but you should correct me if I\u2019m not appearing correctly, it would appear that perhaps there is excess capacity in the industry. Now we have been building a lot of operating leverage into our fixed income franchise over the last couple of years and at the same time we feel very comfortable with our relative position in all of our businesses and so to the extent to which capacity comes out we think we will benefit from that in terms of our competitors exiting businesses but we will have to see. We\u2019re just focused on doing what we can with our opportunity set.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Good morning, Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Good morning. Thanks a lot. Maybe first question just getting back to the ROE given that you have more clarity on some of these rules, whether its RWA leveraged Volcker, you just spent a few years trying to kind of reposition the business. I guess what inning do you feel like you are in terms of repositioning? And then at some point, you sold some of the U.S. reinsurance business, I think the Europeans there, I guess some point you need to be able to either redeploy more than your earnings in terms of capital or are you seeing enough opportunities globally as the economy and the macro environment improves that you can start reinvesting to generate high returns?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So it\u2019s a great question. So obviously we have taken a number of steps over the past several years to in terms of selling businesses that because of rule changes were quite frankly just better held than other people and when you provide the proper return, then as I said going to the hood, we have been building in as much operating flexibility into, for example, our fixed income franchise as we can during this fortune environment. So I guess I would say with respect to capital first and foremost, we just want to make sure that firm is positioned safely and defensively and at the same time we can be offensive when opportunities present themselves, but it\u2019s really going to be determined by client activity, economic growth, confidence that will be the opportunity set and will just adjust. It will always be incremental. So you will see us make incremental steps. You have seen us take some move selling things, but you will see us make incremental steps, but really now, it\u2019s about that balance, because we don\u2019t want to forgo the upside.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just on the banking side, you mentioned pipeline remains strong. It feels like we are coming off a very strong 2013 just given particularly on the equity side and even on the debt side, but when you look at the outlook and you look at the conversations, is it possible to have multiple years meaning \u201814/15 with an improving economy, where the investment banking revenues are continuing to grow off this base and maybe partially it\u2019s because we had five years of pretty anemic activity in some areas. I just want to get your outlook is this some view that \u201813 was a great year and some spot and so the growth rate from here might be tougher?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">It\u2019s a good question. So if you sort of just think about our investment banking franchise and you break it down between let\u2019s just say underwriting on one side and advisory services, the merger business on the other. The underwriting activities clearly there is a market component to that in terms of tightening credit spreads people looking to put capital to work and then obviously you saw it in the fourth quarter a big uptick in equity underwriting, the market was there. The advisory business for a CEO making a decision on a merger, it\u2019s a career defining decision and against the backdrop. Again, go back and look at 2013, against the backdrop in one quarter you are contemplating what is tapering mean and then two quarters later, you are contemplating a government shutdown at that difficult backdrop to make a career defining decision. And so it\u2019s going to lack that client and you are going to see pickup in M&amp;A activity in sectors where you see global confidence and so not surprising to us at all and we have been very protective about franchise obviously a leading franchise.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Now, as it relates to some of the other markets like for example take the debt market, one thing I have learned in the past year, because I think one of the most frequently asked questions I got at the end of the last year was what is the debt underwriting looking like in the environment in 2013? I couldn\u2019t have told you that there will be as much activity as there was. We just respond to when we look to deliver for our clients in it. Now, you could paint a picture of a declining debt environment, but also you could see debt transactions of significant swing to mergers. We have seen some of that Europe recovery and a long-term shift to the capital markets, growth markets shifting more towards capital markets due to very long-term trends that are in place. Simple, we will say.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. And then just last question on FICC, you just I guess given some of the near term trends that we could see. I just want to get an update on how you see some of this transition of the OTC markets under these swap execution facility platforms, maybe we will get it mid-February you know who knows if it will get a delay but it seems like clearing was fine last year. I just want to get your sense on talking to client, talking to customers, is it progressing? So we don\u2019t have many hitches, little bit more challenging.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Sure I actually think the regulators approach and all the industry participants, clients, exchanges and clears I thought that the process of clearing I don\u2019t know if you give it higher marks. It was done in stages, it was very orderly. I think the issue with swap execution facilities obviously there is a big technology build and change in behavior across all of our clients and so the only thing I would say about and we will have to see what happens in February is I think that measured approach the clearing was quite thoughtful and I know there is lots of discussion about the approach you know the burden is on all of us to make sure that you know as an industry we adopt these protocols. A lot of burden obviously on swap execution facilities because they are the center of all this connectivity but clients need to be ready. It's hard for me to gage their preparedness but I think if it was staged and I don\u2019t mean extended but I think if it was staged and it mirrored the approach to clearing I think at the margin it just I don\u2019t know maybe it's just more prudent.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question is from the line of Roger Freeman with Barclays. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Roger Freeman \u2013 Barclays</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Can you just remind us what you think the obviously the market condition is depend on, what that with the realization profile looks like in terms of (indiscernible) I mean is this kind of, so a couple of three years of you know mature investments that we will see coming out?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So obviously and we talked about this over the course of the year, it's an environment that has been favorable for harvesting and so you\u2019re seeing that as we go through. We are also seeing interesting opportunities around the globe for investing but you\u2019re seeing the performance as it comes through.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Roger Freeman \u2013 Barclays</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">How should we think about the comp ration? You know it's probably it's not maybe is it explicit there but how do you think about compensation on those and how it's beneficial throughout the sort of managing compensation on the firm?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So absolutely no change to how we\u2019re thinking about compensation. First you know we manage the compensation across the firm it's a collection of businesses and pay is based on firm performance then we go into the divisions and obviously down to the individual and so obviously it's our largest expense. We spend significant time on it; I think you\u2019re seeing the benefit of you know some of the tough cost cutting that we embedded into the business over the last couple of years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Roger Freeman \u2013 Barclays</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And I guess one more and I know it was Volcker out of the way and now do you think you\u2019ve got enough clarity around all the rules, the capital requirements et cetera to step up investing on balance sheet again as the opportunity sets in there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">The short answer is yes but I would breakdown regulatory clarity from the opportunity set. The opportunity set is going to be driven by what we see working with our clients and being very disciplined about returns as we have in the past. In terms of the rules that, you know the rules that gives a road map or the various alternatives under which you can undertake the activities you can you invest with your clients in 3% funds, you can work with other Volcker compliant structures and obviously we can invest off our balance sheet. So but that speaks to how the when and working with clients that will be opportunity driven.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Roger Freeman \u2013 Barclays</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And secondly, you mentioned that you thought were still not quite in a normal cyclical cycle so I guess how far off do you think we\u2019re not time wise but just how much of an impact are these other things having and at this time what would you say the top 2 or 3 sort of issues are that are keeping you from saying this is within the balance of the cyclical norms.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yeah so what I was really trying to underscore there is some of the things I mentioned earlier, which is focusing on a shift from quantitative easing to tapering or the entire financial symptoms are adjusting to multi-year processes in regulatory reforms or a government shutdown. Again, things are not normal characteristics of a cycle. And so referencing the script is sort of supply and demand driven see really what are the fundamentals of the economy, what are the fundamentals of performance of companies, and that\u2019s really what I was talking about it, it maybe not the best score, but it\u2019s more of a return to sort of the normal day to day challenges. And as you have seen in the past, when there was economic growth in activity in a degree of certainty, our clients are willing to make significant decisions, commit more capital and we get to work with them and the activity levels pickup.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Roger Freeman - Barclays</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Gently, but the trend is slowly improving, steadily.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Roger Freeman - Barclays</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Really obviously just had a couple of weeks there at the start of the year, but how would you characterize client engagement so far?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Client engagement, we are very, very focused on our clients in terms of the first couple of weeks, way too early to extrapolate anything.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Roger Freeman - Barclays</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yes, okay. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Good morning Guy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thank you. Good morning Harvey. So on the I&amp;L obviously you had significant gains whether they were to the extent that they were realized or not in a sense that maybe it doesn\u2019t even matter, because given the IPO environment and the apparently very much improving M&amp;A environment, a significant amount of this probably will be over the course of the next year or so it seems to me. And so then the question is what\u2019s your philosophy with respect to capital return of discrete amounts like that? And do you think it\u2019s possible to make a case to the Fed that for significant freeing up of capital of despite it\u2019s not necessarily the right approach to kind of compare to earnings?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So it\u2019s a good question. I think the core of your question where you are saying is basically if risk is down. So the consumption of capital is lower and the demand for capital isn\u2019t there, the question is can we return or not return it, okay. Now, the way we will look at that question is first and foremost running with periods of excess capital is not a problem if we feel like we are going to be able to deploy that capital. We are never going to force that deployment. So first and foremost is going to be risk judgment about how we utilize it. If we say opportunities, where capital cannot be deployed and I will say for the long-term, for example, in our insurance businesses where the rules have changed, then we will look to return it. And we\u2019ll work with the Fed over time in the construct to return that capital, I am certainly not speaking for the Fed here, but I don\u2019t think any industry benefits from holding excess capital in the system for an extended period of time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">That\u2019s there. On Volcker, you mentioned that you have a very high level committee that\u2019s looking at implementation and the things that you need to do in order to implement it fully. As analysts should we be focused more on potential revenue impacts of that implementation or the cost of that implementation?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I think, well, clearly the cost structure issue is one need to focus on, because as I mentioned the compliance burden is pretty intent. I think the revenue again, one of the things in the rule obviously and I have to get the exact language, but basically you said that market-making activities effectively essential, because it promotes healthy capital markets. And so I think that the Volcker Rule is covered, we will have to see ultimately in the implementation what happens, but at least in the intent of the final rule that seems clear that they want to support capital markets. And so those revenue opportunities again are going to be predominantly driven by the opportunity set. That\u2019s all I think about it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Now, in terms of our implementation team, this is just kind of typical how we approach it just making sure that we have identified the right people across entire firm to make sure that we do it as efficiently as possible and then there will be a build, but at this stage, it\u2019s way too early to sort of quantify any ongoing cost structure for you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay that\u2019s helpful to get the philosophy of how you\u2019re thinking about those things. The term to revenue ratio as was mentioned earlier did come in lower for the year and you know to the extent that there was a significant revenue shift certainly in the latter part of the year, it seems to have been in favor of I&amp;L<strong>. </strong>Is 37% sort of a benchmark that we should be thinking about now for next year or if for example in 2014 revenue were similar but the composition was more traditional markets and investment banking and less I&amp;L, would we expect that comp ratio to be higher?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So that\u2019s a great question. It's way too early to tell obviously in terms of how we will think about compensation in 2014. It will be driven as I said before by performance and the performance will be driven by obviously the collection of businesses that we run. I think that the mix issue, I understand why you\u2019re asking the question but there is no single business or segment that drives compensation expense for Goldman Sachs and so you know for example if you had asked a question slightly differently you said listen let\u2019s just say I&amp;L everything else being equal and I&amp;L was down I would expect that means the performance of the fund is down it's obviously compensation expense would be down but at that point in time we will be incorporating all factors, competitive positioning, and this is we\u2019re building because while it's pay for performance for the year it's also investing for the long term.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Just a couple of housekeeping questions. I don\u2019t know if you have talked about the impact of the (indiscernible) sale on FICC revenues in the quarter I didn\u2019t see it in the release if you could help us with that, that would be good.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yeah sure no problem. So on a DVA adjusted basis sequentially and obviously we had a challenging third quarter in FICC, and got a lot of attention but sequentially DVA adjusted revenues were up 46% if you adjust for the sale of the European insurance business it's more like 30% it's roughly about $200 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And then final housekeeping type of question. You talked about the SLR being pretty much in compliance on an NTR basis. Have you had a chance yet to think about what the impact would be of adoption of the final Basel add-ons?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">No we haven't, we\u2019re still digesting the rule. As you would imagine under that paradigm obviously just because of the nature of our business it impacts our ratio more as a result of things like netting and collateral but we\u2019re still digging through the rule.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question comes from the line of (indiscernible) with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Just a follow-up on leverage with the question earlier on. Just in light of your relatively stronger position in there. Just given the lengthy timeline for implementation. You know as leverage becomes the binding constraint for your competitors. I would be curious in your thoughts on Goldman\u2019s appetite to be more aggressive or more aggressively compete for market share in client centric but balance sheet heavy businesses like prime brokerage.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">It's an important question, if you just split into two parts for a second on the first part we\u2019re not going to change or approach to risk and by the way the FDA was a good example earlier. We\u2019re not going to change our approach to risk management and how deploy our resources to the extent to which our competitors change their strategy. The other half of the question I think is the way you\u2019re asking which is for example if whatever the constraint is it does not to be the leverage ratio but if a firm is constrained, if our competitors are constrained in a particular business and we have relative strength in that business we would assume that we could be a more valuable provider to our clients on relative basis and that relative strength would just improve. I think that paradigm applies for everybody.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Exactly what I was asking. Thank you. On the compensation policy just given the importance of lower earnings volatility to the regulators and investment community. I was just curious for kind of updated thoughts on how the firms approach to managing the quarterly compensation accrual, do you anticipate quarterly comp accrual will be more sensitive to the revenue environment or should we expect the practice of a 4Q true-up to continue? Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So the practice of the 4Q true-up is just that we said competition we have full visibility into the performance of the business is. So again, no change in compensation philosophy, we actually think it\u2019s quite important to maintain our philosophy around compensation and for all of our employees at Goldman Sachs to understand it, understand our obligation to the firm and the context for the compensation philosophy ultimately obviously as the largest helmet of our cost structure we incorporate everything you would think we would put into that including our obligation to our shareholders.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Hey, good morning Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So I just wanted to follow-up on the full quick question, I know you have got a lot of that already this call. But in thinking about the I&amp;L I know you called out Volcker pertaining to TE into the hedge fund investments you got, but do I take that to mean that the other components of I&amp;L you don\u2019t \u2013 you are not constrained by Volcker, so the real estate piece is the credit piece of the loan funds?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">You are into a pretty intricate territory. So they have got [ph] rules of 900 pages. Right, and so I wasn\u2019t \u2013 what I was basically saying is I was bringing it down to some there is going to be 3% funds.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Right.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And there are going to be other Volcker structures, so for example, historically, the way people may have defined CLOs, you may have included securities and depending on the very intricate definition of the rules, you may not be able to include some securities. And so however the investing activity and working with our clients\u2019 needs to be structured, we are going to comply. I think that the Volcker Rule what it does is it outlines a set of rules where market participants can do that. Again, 3% funds, other covered structures and of course you can invest in line with our balance sheet, which is a pretty straightforward activity, but that\u2019s really what I was trying to emphasize. You really have to go to the rules they have to determine whether you can do real estate in a particular way or not and look we will comply.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Right. No, I get that. It\u2019s just that as you know and you get some good detail about the balances in I&amp;L and how they are broken down in a couple of different ways. So I mean, I think the Street is just going to be looking at that to understand how the capital is getting freed up and then reinvest in that space, because clearly, if there is reinvest, that would be great and that\u2019s not you want to see it bought back. So I was just wondering how you are thinking about disclosing the balances in I&amp;L, I mean, I guess I am just wondering to the degree you can put it in and then a Volcker, non-Volcker kind of disclosure that would be I think helpful for the Street?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So I think we have been pretty good in terms of disclosure around, for example, what the firm\u2019s investment in funds are, it is roughly $15 billion in less than a quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Right.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I think the investing process is going to be one again which is going to be driven by the opportunity set and what our clients want us to do. And so the decision of reinvest or return, we are going to continue to make the decision in the same way. If the opportunity set is not there, we are definitely not going to be a firm that\u2019s going to force investing. We are just going to be disciplined and if we don\u2019t take the opportunities, then we are going to look to return the capital. Now, you are certainly seeing the impact of those businesses in our capital ratios. We talked about things like the financial institution production in the past. And so there are \u2013 there is a lot of aspects to all the rules, not just Volcker, but I am actually 100% sure and I understand your question, so if we need to we connect with them afterwards and we (indiscernible) a bit more.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes, sure. Okay, thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Hi.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">How are you?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. So you guys have VAR kicked up here this quarter, it\u2019s actually kind of at the level we haven\u2019t seen in quite some time, could you walk through and help us understand what drove that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So really all driven by basically an overall decline in market volatility and then an increase a bit in positional risk, but that really is virtually all concentrated in equities as you would expect very active equity quarter, lots of activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. Was there any kind of positional tailwind for your equities business or should we think about this as all sort of solid flow revenue?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Usually it was solid flow revenue, when you do block transactions and it was a particularly active block quarter and I got to give credit to our team I think they did a fantastic job in executing blocks because it was a competitive environment. Those block transactions can be large so they will drive LIBOR [ph]<strong>.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And on the equities business this quarter certainly was better quarter but when you look back at 2013, and you adjust for the sale of the insurance business the revenues really are not all that strong and then kind of stand out on the street as rather week. Are you thinking about, how you\u2019re thinking about loss of share in the equities business and what you want to maybe do to try to counter that till you come up with strategies, what\u2019s your view there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">We are always focused on any area of the business that we can grow and deliver more value to our clients. I would say given our starting position in terms of just our aggregate division in the marketplace, in terms of whether it's prime brokerage, underwriting, the derivative business, our cash business. You know one of the pretty significant position in terms of aggregate market shares. So you know we\u2019re trying to get back to these earlier issue of all revenues aren\u2019t created equally and so I completely understand you\u2019re focused on quarter to quarter changes in revenues. We\u2019re focused on delivering over the long term and it's not that we don\u2019t look at it but there is risk in these revenues and so you really have to look at the entire set of metrics and how it's our pretext margin looked versus other people\u2019s and how are we driving ROE. So we feel very good about our franchise position.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay and that\u2019s fair, well we have only blunt tools so we use the tools we got. And then last one for me, litigation expense we saw you know a pretty big uptick certainly when we include many of the money center bank competitors that\u2019s being a big theme the last few quarters. It definitely feels like this is something we should probably count on the near term, are you do you guys feel as though you\u2019re part of that scrum and how do you feel about your reserve for litigation? Have you had a chance to build it up? Do you feel like you might be a little bit behind the bond upfront, should we count on some build here for the medium term here? Can you give us some color on that? I know it's a hard one.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">This is a very, very important question because all firms in this particular case are not created equally. The way I think for us and the entire marketplace this is our best estimate, so every quarter really no different than mark to market accounting. Every quarter we do our what is basically the best estimate in that particular quarter and we add to the reserves. Now we also obviously disclose a reasonably possible loss which you saw most recently at the end of the third quarter but this is a quarter-to-quarter activity. It is not a budgeted forward looking activity. We incorporate all the information set that we have at this point in time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And do you have a view on where your year-end potential losses above you know reserve levels will shake out or how that will change versus your last reported number or is it too early to know on that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">No again this is not a budgeted, if I knew at the beginning of 2014 that my estimable and probable number was 962, sorry at the end of 2012 I would have taken 962 in the first quarter. So I would encourage you to go in the financial statements if you look at our reasonable possible loss that\u2019s a good disclosure item which was $4 million at the end of the third quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question is from the line of Michael Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Michael Mayo \u2013 CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I\u2019m still not sure on the answer to the Volcker Rule and I understand it's 900 pages, there is lot of work to be done but you know one of your competitor said it should not have a material impact and we can all come up with our own estimates what the impact of Volcker might be on you guys but can you just give us some range like it should impact our revenues you know from X to Y percent or expenses from Y to Z percent or size it to some degree?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I thought I was clear [ph] in terms of the revenues that at this stage it doesn\u2019t look like a revenue impacting items since the Pablo<strong> </strong>but of course we\u2019ve already (indiscernible) other businesses early on in the process and made changes. And so I don\u2019t think the primary issue at this point in Volcker is about revenue impact although we have to see how regulators ultimately digest all the data they are requesting etcetera. And with respect to the compliance costs that I mentioned, it\u2019s just too early to quantify, but there is a pretty extensive compliance regime.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Michael Mayo \u2013 CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. And as it relates to VAR, to what degree are you deliberately taking more risk, I think your predecessors used to say we want to live to fight another day as far as risk of mentality, it seems like maybe you are taking a little more risk in equities, but not necessarily elsewhere or what\u2019s your risk stance?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So I think my predecessor also would have said we will never deliberately take more risk. It\u2019s just not the way we are going to run the enterprise. It\u2019s all activity driven. So that\u2019s why I emphasize the equity number picking up during the fourth quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Michael Mayo \u2013 CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. And for the year revenues were flat even with much higher stock markets even with gains in investing and lending. So when you look out looking for revenue growth, where do you think that can come from?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So look I think the most important thing for us this year was how we found that balance in terms of achieving the 11% ROE and at the same time continuing to drive operating leverage. We feel very good about franchise position in an absolute sense, in a relative sense. So I am certainly not predicting the future, but as economic activity picks up, confidence picks up, capital markets around the world, particular regions. I think you could certainly paint an optimistic picture, but I want to be clear I am not doing that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Michael Mayo \u2013 CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. And what is the ROE target for Goldman?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yes. Thanks for asking the question that way, Mike. Yes, I understand this is an important issue for all of you and we are getting increasing clarity around the world sets, although the sale a fair bit too dull. When we put out an ROE target, I think first and foremost, we wanted to be credible and we wanted to be achievable. And so when you hear from us that\u2019s what it will be. Now, between now and then, no one should get off this call thinking that we are not exquisitely focused on how we are deploying our capital and how we are focused on returns and how we are thinking about returns to our shareholders. So that was the target point today, Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Michael Mayo \u2013 CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">No, I understand. But I mean when do you think you will have a target? When do you think you have enough clarity around the capital rules to highlight an ROE target?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t predict the ultimate visibility into the rules they had and what it means for markets, but when we have \u2013 but we know it\u2019s important to you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Michael Mayo \u2013 CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Alright, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Thanks Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yes. Hey, good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Hey, Jim.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Hey. First question on equity derivatives, you mentioned that it was significantly lower this year versus last year, I guess that volatility is down, but the market environment was pretty constructive and typically lower utility means little more risk taking. So was there anything unusual this year or I should say last year in terms of derivatives that was so much weaker than \u201812 how should we think about that going forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">No, there was nothing in there. I think you are just seeing the natural tos and fros of client activity and markets, but there is no single item I draw your attention to.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. And then maybe on the capital side, you guys highlighted about a 60 basis point difference between the standardized and advanced approach, do you envision that converging over the next few years and what would be the major drivers?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So, as you know the standardized approach really is in (indiscernible) not as risk centric and so that\u2019s not something that we had focused on as much. So things like collapsing derivative notional, which is a good thing to do for managing operational risk. So it\u2019s really something that we are starting to focus on now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Because you are going to \u2013 the Fed wants you to report the lower of the two, right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yes, well both.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Right.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Now, of course, under the transitional rules as I mentioned, we are north of a 100 basis points higher anyway. So we are going to get fully phased in numbers which we have a couple of years on.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Right.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Jim, from your perspective, I wouldn\u2019t consider it as a significant issue.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay, fair enough. And lastly on compression credits [ph], do you view that as a material benefit for you guys going forward? Do you think its early stages and still a lot of room there as it\u2019s sort of more in the margin?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So it\u2019s early, but certainly the rule set, but that\u2019s an example of where a rule set comes out and rule set gets behavior and in this case you are starting to see the behavior and I would think you continue to see a pickup momentum.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question is from the line of Fiona Swaffield from RBC. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Fiona Swaffield - RBC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Just a clarification on the moving parts on the Basel III look through the 9.8 which seems pretty static. Could you talk us through I think it's given the RWA number but in the last quarter the deductions moved quite significantly and I thought they might continue to do so. Doesn\u2019t look like much is happening there and also is there some operational risk inflation? I think it's marginal but I do remember a number being a bit lower than that six months ago. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Sorry can you just say the second half of the question Fiona?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Fiona Swaffield - RBC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I think you said a number of operational risk weighted assets of 85 billion I\u2019m not sure I got it, I think that\u2019s slightly higher. I\u2019m just trying to understand why the RWA is not going down a bit more with the natural roll-off?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay so with the type of ratio there is a lots of give and get under the hood and one of the biggest drivers as you know since the final rule came out has really being the financial institutions deduction, well significant and non-significant and so that was really the most significant change in the final rule which drove it but you know for example we picked up a benefit on the sale of the European insurance business of 20 basis points but that was then offset by other risk factors. So they said it's a fair bit happening under the hood.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Fiona Swaffield - RBC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And is it right that on operational risk weighted assets it's trending slightly up, is that an offset of the roll-off of\u2026</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yeah I know that\u2019s correct slightly higher and as you know operational risk, RWA they are slow moving and they are sticky.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question is from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Just a couple of housekeeping related items given that we have gone through most of the important questions at this point. In terms of the fixed income inflows that you highlighted in your prepared remarks I guess I\u2019m just curious if you can provide some further color on why those inflows were so much bigger than some of the other areas given you know most people\u2019s view that rates are going to be going higher and that presumably that means investors would be thinking about moving money into less rate sensitive areas.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yeah so I think it's a pretty straightforward answer, there is two parts. One is just about differentiated performance in fixed income and also there were funds that we have that are unconstrained fixed income products which you know are giving investors the flexibility I think and give us a more dynamic ability and managing the rate environment but really performance driven.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And I guess let me follow-up on prior question talking about your opportunities. How do you think about the revenue opportunities over the next couple of years across your geographic regions, I guess broadly speaking U.S., Europe and Asia? Is the greatest opportunity in the U.S. given some of the confidence we\u2019re getting relative to the economy or some of the trends you were talking about that we have been hearing about for a long time in terms of fixed income issuance, in Europe finally moving out of the banks and into capital market.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Yeah so quite frankly hard if not impossible to predict but with respect to our position and our commitment we feel quite good about how we have deployed the resources and how we have made adjustments of the resources during this portion of the cycle. You know for example we have maintained a very strong commitment to Japan. Well certain of our competitors have decreased their emphasis on Japan because you know as I referenced in my comment, the equity market haven't been in deep levels since 1972 and so we feel well positioned to capture the opportunity. Now importantly it's not about any individual region but it's the connectivity across our businesses and ability to connect for example our investment banking clients with resources in institutional client services, our securities division where we can deliver solutions globally. In Asia, people are looking to raise capital and it woo [ph] the U.S. investors that\u2019s really where you get the synergistic leverage across the enterprise.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And I realized question about the backlog has fraught with issues but presumably if you were at a five year high in the backlog three months ago it's grown a little bit since then as of year-end. You\u2019ve seen very strong improvement in IPOs, IPO issuance. M&amp;A looks like it's building, is the composition of the backlog now moving more towards M&amp;A and less from equities and fixed income?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">No there is not a huge shift in terms of mix although there were some adjustments certainly quarter, but what you are really seeing is and this might have been hard to predict at the end of the third quarter is replenishment, because it\u2019s pretty active fourth quarter. And so to the extent which it\u2019s a leading indicator it\u2019s obviously a positive one. And I do think it reflects as I said earlier sort of global sentiment if you will in confidence and our corporate client base, but look that could change.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay, thanks for taking my question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Steven Chubak - Nomura Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Hi, good morning Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Hey, Steven.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Steven Chubak - Nomura Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So I had a question regarding the investment considerations, particularly as it relates to Volcker on fund related investing versus direct balance sheet investing. So fund-related investing largely limited, direct balance sheet investing appears to be permissible, but I didn\u2019t know if it is apparently are the IRR or at least investment considerations meaningfully different between the two?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">No. So IRRs are IRRs, we don\u2019t adjust for the vehicle, if you will in terms of how we deploy that capital. So we would never allow, what do we call the term discipline to be corrupted by the particular vehicle in choice. I do think that the capital treatment can vary obviously as we talked about the financial institutions deduction and the money we have in front which obviously have to come out anyway. It\u2019s quite significant, but the risk gets captured in any number of metrics. It will be in the capital ratios, it\u2019s obviously stressed under CCAR. So it\u2019s not a vehicle choice.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Steven Chubak - Nomura Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay. Well, I actually had a follow-up to that. I didn\u2019t know if you could disclose the RWAs attached to the other $45 billion or so of I&amp;L investments that I suppose aren\u2019t \u2013 that are in fact Volcker compliant?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Yes. I don\u2019t have that number, but you are welcomed to follow-up with Dane after the call.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Steven Chubak - Nomura Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay. And do you happen to have the number of further financial institution deduction for which is roughly $8 billion last quarter, I didn\u2019t know if it was roughly around that same level?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yes, it\u2019s up a bit since the third quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Steven Chubak - Nomura Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay. And just last one for me on the leverage ratio, I didn\u2019t know if there is a specific target that we should be contemplating longer term. So assuming that the 5% ratio are mandated level is the binding constraint, is there some sort of buffer that we should be contemplating on a go-forward basis?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">We haven\u2019t given where we are in terms of the proposed rules obviously. And as you know, our philosophy on these things is given the regulators have provided an adequate glide path we will wait to see the final rule, before we will adjust any aspects of our business. And ultimately, you will see us run with a buffer, but we haven\u2019t invested any energy in that yet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Steven Chubak - Nomura Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yes, that\u2019s it for me. Thank you for taking my questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Thanks so much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And your next question is from the line of Christopher Wheeler with Mediobanca. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Christopher Wheeler - Mediobanca</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yes, thank you. Good morning. Couple of questions. The first one is on something that\u2019s philosophical this morning in the FT after your former partner\u2019s testimony yesterday to the social committee, where you mentioned that the European bonus cap was something that wasn\u2019t the most appropriate magnet of managing bonuses. Can you talk a little bit about how you are dealing with that issue, because obviously the FT is running with the view that New York is a much more attractive place for people to be (indiscernible) given this bonus cap? I am just wondering about what you think the impact might be in terms of increasing fixed compensation. I know I think you said it\u2019s not too many people impacted, but have you had to make or will you have to make too many changes in respect of this?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">No. Look it\u2019s more in the context of the firm. Obviously, Europe as a region is critically important to us strategically. So we are very committed to our clients there and our people there. And so no, we will work with the regulators and we will comply accordingly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Christopher Wheeler - Mediobanca</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay. And the second question really is really a follow up on I think what Guy and Betsy have been asking, but I am trying just to get really clear my mind about the capital allocation to I&amp;L and how you are thinking about that from the planning perspective? It seems to me that where this perhaps when would be a couple of years ago the thought was that you are going to be reducing capital, because obviously Volcker was going to force you out. It sounds to me like you have no clear view at the moment on reducing capital in that business. It\u2019s maybe the fact that you will naturally spin off some capital and you will leave it very much depending on the state of the markets to whether you actually lead it in I&amp;L or whether you actually move it elsewhere in the business where you can get high returns, is that a fair way of describing things?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">So with respect of capital coming out of the business obviously the Volcker Rule is very definitive on what we need to achieve. So early on as soon as we identify that as a likely finalized rule item we announced the reduction in our hedge funds. In terms of some funds will just low off depending on the opportunity set but obviously we\u2019re committed to complying with the rule and that\u2019s not optional.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Christopher Wheeler - Mediobanca</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yes but what I\u2019m asking is, it sounds like where capitalist is thrown off, you\u2019re perfectly happy to absolutely (indiscernible) rather than deploy it elsewhere in the business if you see the opportunity. It's not sort of fixed and concrete but you really want to reduce the amounts of capital in your principal business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay I\u2019m sorry I understand the heart of your question now. We don\u2019t think about capital allocation in other words we\u2019re going to deploy an explicit amount of capital to I&amp;L because it's all return opportunity set client driven, so we will be happy to redeploy that capital if it's best use for in another part of our business and if necessary we will look through return on capital.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Your next question is comes from the line of Douglas Sipkin with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Douglas Sipkin \u2013 Susquehanna</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Just two questions one maybe just on the outlook for headcount growth. I guess year-over-year about a flattish year I think net adds about 200. Any feel for what you guys are going to be looking to grow that or sort of keep it steady state right now based on the environment that you\u2019re seeing in front of you right now?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">So no plans for any significant changes, if you dig under the hood a little bit the headline numbers sort of match some of the efficiencies we build. Obviously we talk about that in terms of the build out of for example our Salt Lake City office et cetera and how we\u2019re leveraging technology and people and kind of what I will call the pyramid if you will around the organization but there are no significant plans one way or another but it will be dynamic. If you see growth opportunities then you should expect to see us add if we need to and then if the environment is less favorable we will make other adjustments but it will be dynamic.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Got you and with respect to the asset management segment obviously you guys have had some positive progress there. I know you guys have done couple of small sort of it feels like opportunistic acquisitions, you know given how the capital model of the firm is changing you know would you guys consider something doing something bigger in asset management on acquisitive side? Is it presented itself given sort of the favorable capital/returns that business provides in the new world?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I think that, the business itself has been a huge strategic priority for us and you know what you\u2019re seeing is not the, it's not the result of a quarter\u2019s performance. You\u2019re seeing a multiyear commitment to the business which is you know now starting to show some differentiated yield. In terms of opportunity set look if there are opportunities that are accretive with Goldman Sachs or business and our clients you should expect us to consider anything.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Devin Ryan - JMP Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">So I just have a question on the FICC business. I asked a similar question last quarter but we have now seen outflows out of bound, mutual funds in 29 out of the past 31 week. So I know the number is pretty small in the absolute but just given that your FICC business is more institutional in nature, is that something that maybe you\u2019re paying closer attention to now that the trend has picked up some more steam and are you actually seeing any change in client behavior as a result of that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">So no change in behavior that then I would come in touch with. You know the behavioral changes have been more response to the news dynamic during the course of the year. The issues that I talked about you know what does tapering mean versus QE? What are the government shutdown mean? Those were the kind of things that were little paralyzing at times for clients I think as they contemplated the implications. Obviously over very long periods of time fund flows have an impact potentially in the short one they can when there are dramatic controls [ph] whether it's in the matter with those bond funds or equity flows but I don\u2019t think yet we\u2019re seeing any major change in behavior.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Devin Ryan - JMP Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">And then just a question on comp, can you give any color on the mix of cash versus restricted shares and whether there is any meaningful change from last year in terms of how you thought about that and then just more broadly what the competitive environment, feels like today they recruit and retain talent maybe relative to a year ago?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">No. So we don\u2019t disclose details on the competition there, but you should rest assure that for all \u2013 for everyone that they are \u2013 that is participating, that is receiving equity that maybe there are long-term restrictions on that. And we believe that just basically aligns the broad employee base interest with our shareholders and that\u2019s been historically the case. Now, we thought about it for a long time. With respect to talent, we have seen some tailwinds in the ability and this isn\u2019t recent, but certainly the last year and a half we have seen the ability to acquire talent when needed. And so now having said that, our people are always highly pursued also, but that\u2019s not a new phenomenon.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Devin Ryan - JMP Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Great, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">And this concludes the Q&amp;A session. Please continue with any closing remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">So just want to thank everyone on behalf of the team here for dialing in. We look forward to seeing you during the course of the year and if we don\u2019t see you in the next couple of weeks, we will certainly catch up with you on next quarter\u2019s call. Thanks again everybody.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs fourth quarter 2013 earnings conference call.

My name is Dennis and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today, October 16, 2014. Thank you. Mr. Holmes, you may begin your conference.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Dane Holmes</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. Today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm's belief regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain and outside of the firm's control. The firm's actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our current annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 2013. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets and Global Core Excess. And you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that is posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">This audiocast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Our Chief Financial Officer, Harvey Schwartz, will now review the firm's results. Harvey?</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thanks, Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I'll walk you through our third quarter results, then I'm obviously happy to answer any questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Third quarter net revenues were $8.4 billion; net earnings, $2.2 billion; earnings per diluted share, $4.57. Core to our strategy over the past few years has been a consistent focus on strengthening our relative position within the industry. Our success begins with a fundamental approach of engaging our clients, understanding their challenges and then addressing their needs. That is the foundation for expanding the breadth and depth of our existing relationships and the basis for building new ones.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">For the first nine months in 2014, revenues are 1.4 billion higher than this time last year. The increase reflects the combination of greater client activity in certain businesses and a strong market position. For example, as client activity picked up in global M&amp;A, you saw an increase in our market share. Our global market share in announced M&amp;A for the year-to-date of 29% is up 300 basis points compared to 2013. Our volume advantage to our next closest peer is more than $100 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We have also been focused on making sure that we are well positioned to deliver operating leverage as client activity increases. In 2011, we announced an operating efficiency initiative. This initiative was subsequently increased twice and ultimately reached nearly $2 billion. We continue to expand upon that prior initiative to grow margins and increase returns. The benefits of those efforts are demonstrated in our year-to-date results. We had 1.4 billion of incremental revenues and nearly $1 billion of incremental pre-tax earnings. Ultimately, the embedded operating leverage contributed to an improvement in our year-to-date annualized return on common equity to 11.2%. We have also achieved this result by being a prudent allocator of our global resources. Getting this right not only drives positive results for our clients, but also for our shareholders.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Now let me take you through the quarterly results for each of our businesses. In Investment Banking, we produced third quarter net revenues of $1.5 billion, down 18% compared to a strong second quarter. Importantly, our investment banking backlog increased again during the quarter, reaching its highest level since 2007. Third quarter advisory revenues were 594 million, up 17% from the second quarter on an increase in completed activity. Year-to-date Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced and completed M&amp;A. We advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the third quarter, including Hillshire Brands' $8.6 billion sales to Tyson Foods, InterMune\u2019s $8.3 billion sale to Roche Holdings and Gates Corporation\u2019s $5.4 billion sale to Blackstone. We're also an advisor on a number of significant announced transactions. For example, we\u2019re advising on TRW Automotive's $13.5 billion sale to ZF Friedrichshafen, Siemens' $7.6 billion acquisition of Dresser-Rand and Corio's \u20ac7.2 billion sale to Kl\u00e9pierre.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Moving to underwriting. Net revenues were 870 million in the third quarter, down 32% compared to record second quarter results. Equity underwriting revenues, up 426 million, were 22% lower sequentially as industry wide activity decline in the third quarter across secondary offerings. Year-to-date, Goldman Sachs ranked first in global equity and equity related and common stock offerings. Debt underwriting revenues decreased 39% from a record second quarter to 444 million due to reduced activity particularly within leverage finance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">During the third quarter, we remained committed to meeting our clients' diverse finance needs, whether it was Alibaba\u2019s $25 billion IPO, Sysco\u2019s $5 billion financing in support of its acquisition of US Foods or ADP's $1.6 billion high-yield offering.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Turning to Institutional Client Services. Net revenues were $3.8 billion in the third quarter with FICC Client Execution of 2.2 billion and Equities of $1.6 billion. ICS includes a one-time $270 million gain related to the tender of a portion of our trust preferred security. Excluding the fixed portion of the one-time gain in DVA, FICC Client Execution net revenues were $2 billion in the third quarter, down 11% sequentially. Mortgages declined quarter-over-quarter as clients were less active amid a relatively stable backdrop of prices. Credit declined significantly as increased volatility, wider credit spreads and lower issuance provided a more difficult backdrop. Currencies, interest rates and commodities were all higher sequentially as volatility and volumes generally increased from relatively low levels.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">When you exclude equities portion of the one-time gain in DVA, the results within this segment were as follows. Total Equities net revenues were $1.5 billion, down 10% sequentially; Equities Client Execution net revenues of $372 million were down 26% quarter-over-quarter reflecting lower net revenues in cash products; commissions and fees were 745 million, relatively flat with the second quarter; securities services generated net revenues of 343 million, down 8% sequentially from the seasonally stronger second quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Turning to risk. Average daily VaR in the third quarter was 66 million, down 14% relative to the second quarter, mostly driven by interest rates.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Moving on to our Investing &amp; Lending activities. Collectively they produced net revenues of $1.7 billion in the third quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of 876 million, primarily reflecting company specific events including IPOs and net gains in public equities. For example, one of our investments, Mobileye went public and our investment generated 285 million in net gains during the third quarter. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were 606 million and benefited from net gains on certain investments due to asset sales and net interest income. Other revenues of 210 million include revenues from the Firm\u2019s consolidated investments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In Investment Management, we reported third quarter net revenues of $1.5 billion. Management and other fees reached a record 1.21 billion. During the quarter total assets under supervision increased $8 billion to a record $1.15 trillion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Let me quickly walk you through the long-term flows. Long-term assets under supervision had net inflows of $13 billion with 7 billion in equity assets and $6 billion in fixed income assets. This was largely offset by foreign currency translation which drove net market depreciation of $12 billion. As we have discussed before, the key to long-term success is delivering strong and consistent performance for our Investment Management clients. Across the global platform, 81% of our client mutual funds' assets ranked in the top two quartiles on a three-year basis and 76% ranked in the top two quartiles on a five-year basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as benefits, was accrued at a compensation-to-net revenues ratio of 40%. This is 300 basis points lower than the Firm's accrual in the first half of the year. The lower compensation accrual reflects stronger year-to-date revenues, greater clarity on full year compensation levels and our continued efforts to improve operating efficiency across the firm. Third quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.3 billion, down 4% sequentially.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Now let me quickly run you through some key stats. Total staff at the end of the third quarter was approximately 33,500. This is up 3% from the second quarter due to summer hiring. Our effective tax rate was 31% year-to-date. Our global core excess liquidity ended the quarter at $180 million. Our Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio was 11.8% using the advanced approach. It was 11.1% under the standardized approach. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished the quarter at 4.9% based on the final rules. We repurchased 7.1 million shares of common stock for $1.25 billion during the quarter. And finally, we announced an increase in our quarterly common stock dividend from $0.55 to $0.60 per share.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Before we turn to Q&amp;A, let me leave you with some concluding thoughts. A constant in our history as a public company is an unrelenting desire to provide world class service to our clients and superior returns to our shareholders. Given the dynamic nature of our industry, meeting that objective requires adaptability. Since we went public in 1999, there are several examples that are readily available. We went from 250 billion assets in 1999 to 1.2 trillion in 2008 and then back to approximately $870 billion today. And along the way we made Goldman Sachs a stronger firm. We increased our common equity from $10 million to over $70 billion and substantially increased our liquidity pool which now fits at $180 billion. We have expanded our global footprint and increased the diversity of our franchise. Our number of offices is up by more than a third to over 50 with one quarter of our staff located in Bangalore, Salt Lake City, Singapore and Texas.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Back in 1999, we had approximately 3,000 people in our technology division. Now we have nearly 8,000. They represent close to a quarter of the firm. We also built an Asset Management business, largely organically, from a few hundred million assets under supervision to 1.15 trillion today. By adapting, we\u2019ve fundamentally improved the strength of our Firm, our opportunity set and as a result our ability to deliver for our clients and our shareholders. Going forward, we will make any necessary changes to continue our history of providing superior client service and generating industry leading returns. It\u2019s what our clients, our shareholders and our culture demands.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Now just before I take your questions, I\u2019d like to make one additional closing comment about the market environment we\u2019ve seen over the past week and particularly yesterday and this morning. It\u2019s clearly an environment that reminds all of us about the power of investor sentiment and how fragile it can be at times. Yesterday in particular, it was clearly a market in the morning where investors were, quite frankly, shooting first and asking questions later. We've seen this market reaction in the past. And while painful, it\u2019s somewhat a normal part of how markets function. Clearly investors are now debating whether we\u2019ll see lower rates for longer and more importantly whether the global economy is slowing or continuing to grow. These are questions that the market has certainly debated before. We\u2019ve always believed that over the long term markets follow fundamentals.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In speaking with our economists only yesterday, they would argue that nothing has fundamentally changed in the past few weeks or certainly the last 24 hours regarding the long-term outlook for the global economy. That doesn\u2019t mean it will continue to grow, but it certainly doesn\u2019t mean it will stall. For us, in any environment, it\u2019s always about staying close to our clients. Yesterday was a difficult day for many of them. Our focus is being there for them. We have the intellectual capital and the financial capital to help address their needs and we remain committed to doing it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">With that, I\u2019m happy to take any of your questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p4\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Operator </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">(Operator Instructions) Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with ISI. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI Group Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Hi, thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Good morning, Glenn.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI Group Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Good morning. So Investment &amp; Lending continues to do great and the future being what it is with this quarter. But I\u2019m just curious, you mentioned the good IPO market obviously, but if you could break down maybe on the equity side what was realized gains versus marks and then if we\u2019ve seen any changes in the composition of the overall asset base between equity debt and lending assets?</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">There hasn\u2019t been a major shift from the -- if you look at the Investing &amp; Lending balance sheet, you won't see a major shift in terms of the quarter. As you know, the investing and the lending business, it\u2019s a long term business and so you will see changes overtime. Obviously, as I highlighted, we continue to harvest. Part of that is obviously driven by the strength in the market but also part of that is driven by the idiosyncratic strength of the portfolio. And so it continues to perform quite well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI Group Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">But no breakdown on realized or unrealized on the equity side?</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">So it's not a question of realized or unrealized. I mean that's why I am struggling with that point. In terms of when you are talking about things of, for example public versus event driven events, but we've always mark to marketed the portfolio as we work through. And so a good portion of the events over the past quarter were all events and IPOs as I highlighted.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI Group Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Okay, good. That's all I was really calling calling towards.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Sorry, I got confused by your wording.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI Group Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">No worries. I confuse myself too. I appreciate the comment on some of the balance sheet data that everyone is looking for. Maybe just one more thing on total losses absorbing capital, you are at the highs, you have tons and you turned out a lot of your long-term debt. You also have among the highs short-term wholesale funding at last look which the Fed has focused on. And so last quarter you did a bunch of repositioning ahead of CCAR and reducing balance sheet and the repo book. I am assuming that no call-out means no big changes this quarter. But if you could just comment on repo book size, short-term wholesale funding and if any more adjustments are needed?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So at this stage we don't feel there is any adjustment needed. As we highlighted and we focused on in the last quarter, the balance sheet did come down pretty significantly. I will say with respect to the balance sheet, as you know, it\u2019s always going to be dynamic. And we'll always take our cues from the clients in the marketplace. But as you saw in the quarter, it basically went up $9 billion. And when you compare the quarter end to quarter end second quarter to third quarter liquidity pool, basically all of that's in the liquidity pool. So that was any growth in the balance sheet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">In terms of the balance sheet, we are going to continuing to remain very disciplined in terms of returns. And as you said, there was no response in terms of the CCAR process last year which drove us to reassess our ROE hurdles that we required and we did that in conjunction with our clients. But we will continue to focus on it. But as you said, the Firm's capital levels and liquidity levels remain quite high. I mean at this stage, 20% of the balance sheet is our liquidity pool.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI Group Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">All right. Last one is -- I appreciate the comments on the market. In the past, when there were big spikes in volatility, if that happened in a short period of time, that was typically bad for the broker dealer community. But inventories are down like, I don't know, 80%, 90%. I am just curious if big spikes and volatility are less painful this go around given all the changes in broker dealer balance sheets?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So I think the comment with respect to the short-term reaction function as it relates to market volatility. As I mentioned, yesterday, today, particularly difficult days for our clients. And if it's difficult for our clients in the short run, markets can be challenging. And so we always root for good things for our clients and for good markets. We will have to see how this period of volatility translates. If you take a step back and you look at the third quarter, when we came into the third quarter, everybody was focused on the fact that there was absolutely no volatility. And as we here see here today people feel like there is too much. So it's a little bit of too hot, too cold. In September, I think a takeaway from September is that in the right market environments you can really see a huge pickup in client activity and then you can see the operating leverage for us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">In terms of the de-risking in terms of the balance sheet that you are seeing across the industry, I don't think that's a 'broker dealer' issue. I think if you look across large global financial institutions and you look at the reduction in risk-weighted assets over the course of the past several years, I think that's a question that we will see overtime as to whether or not that decline in risk carrying capacity along with other adjustments and other regulatory rules, what impact that has ultimately on liquidity for the marketplace. So we will see.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI Group Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">I hear you. Okay, thanks very much. I appreciate it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Thanks, Glenn.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Operator </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Hey thanks, Harvey. Harvey, just one thing on the numbers, just in terms of the -- I think you gave the advanced and the standardized and it looks like that might have been the transitional for the general comment. Just wondered if you had the fully phased in?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Yeah. So the fully phased advanced is 10.6%, fully phased standardized is 10%. And I will remind you again that I think maybe it's a midpoint between fully phased and advanced if you were to think about -- sorry, fully phased advanced. And if you think about how our capital ratios migrate as we take investments out of funds, more or less think of it as a midpoint in terms of the long-term projection. That of course if you assume that between now and 2018, the balance sheet was totally static. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay, that's helpful.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Which of course it won't be.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Yeah. And then just on composition in the comp ratio, I think the color that you gave is helpful and obviously it's a moving target. When I think about this year, last year, the true-up that you do in the third quarter and then you\u2019re trying to gauge what can happen in the fourth quarter, is there anything that's changing or is this just same process, you\u2019ll see other revenue environment factors in and then you'll readjust the fourth quarter? I just want to make sure the process isn't changing versus what you\u2019ve done in the past.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Well, absolutely no change in the process. I won\u2019t drag you through the underpinning to the process. We've talked about it a lot. But at its core, it\u2019s just paper performance. That\u2019s the philosophy and that\u2019s how we do it. In every quarter we make our best estimate as to the compensation accrual. And I think the extent to which you\u2019re seeing a change, there is no change in process. But you\u2019ve seen a change over the last two years just in our operating leverage and the cost reduction efforts that are coming in. And so this year's accrual reflects the fact that last year\u2019s third quarter looked 25% better year-over-year third quarter-third quarter and we\u2019re running $1.4 billion ahead in revenues. And so that just gives us greater clarity in terms of the compensation levels. But it reflects I think more predominantly the operating leverage that's in the business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay. And then finally just on -- I guess you went through some of the ratios on all the regulatory changes that we know and then you\u2019re coming up, whether it\u2019s an SVaR, a few factors, things that are ahead, but it also sounds like the industry is doing some things to maybe get in front of that and whether it\u2019s the agreement on derivatives, there was some chat around the repo markets going to CCPs. So I guess on any of these initiatives that are in the works, is there anything that you would point to that might take care of or deal with some of the concerns that the future regulatory items you\u2019re focused on? I know it\u2019s early, so I know typically you don\u2019t want to comment too much until the rules are out there, but just wanted to get your take, because it does seem a little bit different on the industry just trying to get and find out some of these things.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">I think it\u2019s a really, really important question. I think that when you look at any one of the rules that in an industry we work with regulators on and regulators have put in place new capital requirements, new liquidity requirements under the LCR, leverage tests, in any one of these rules you could have a very active and heated debate with respect to the molecules in the rule and whether this was calibrated too intentionally. But I don\u2019t think you can debate really the concept of the rule. And so I think in concept most of the rules that we\u2019ve seen make sense and that goes back to the initiatives around clearing swap execution facilities. And I think you have to give the regulators a lot of credit quite frankly for creating an immense amount of regulation and proper regulatory response in giving folks a long time line to adjust to it, very important for our clients and for the capital markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">I think the big open question is, and it's a very, very hard thing for any market participant and regulator to weigh if kind of what\u2019s the collective weight of all of this. And I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ll really be able to assess that until a lot of time passes. I think when it comes to things like the discussions around having repo clearing, I think those are good, healthy market reactions. Generally speaking those are a combination of discussions with clients, because they raise concern, regulators observe, for example increased sales in treasury markets and I think it\u2019s incumbent upon all of us as market participants to be thoughtful and creative about how we make sure that we protect our capital markets. But I do think it\u2019s pretty early days in being able to assess these things. But I think the industry is being very active in trying to make sure that we have the most robust capital markets in the world.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. Thanks a lot.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Sure.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Your next question is from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Good morning, Christian.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Good morning. Just wanted to follow up on the question on Investment &amp; Lending. Debt revenues in particular were robust this quarter and stands out given the backdrop of credit were choppy in the quarter. You mentioned assets sales. I would appreciate any color on how much asset sales drove this quarter\u2019s revenues and more broadly any color on the long-term drivers of the debt line?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So in terms of the long-term that was the debt line, again this is just going to be our approach to how we think about allocating capital and when we see opportunities. So, during the period it\u2019s not so much that a specific asset responding to a particular change in credit spreads in the marketplace, but it will be driven by harvesting over a long period of time. So as companies refinance their capital structures, we may be a beneficiary in that, for example if we\u2019re providing mezzanine level debt to a particular entity. And so that\u2019s why we said that it was driven by many things on investment. And of course there is net interest income in there also which is roughly about $200 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Just on the investment banking backlogs, you mentioned that remained strong and increased again this quarter. Just curious, do you have any sense of how much of your backlogs that are tied to so called tax inversion deals?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So with respect to the backlog, the backlog again was the highest it's been since 2007. And actually when we look at it, we look at it across the three categories of advisory, equity underwriting and debt underwriting obviously and all categories were up. So that was good to see. It\u2019s not a question of I think inversions in the backlog. When you actually -- when you talk to our M&amp;A team and you actually look at the data either this year over a long period of time, inversion transactions have not been a significant driver of global M&amp;A activity. And really when you get into conversations with the team, what they'll tell you is it's never just about an inversion or a tax benefit, it\u2019s really about the strategic benefits if the two organizations can come together.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Just a quick clean up question here. In the earnings release you have referenced high impairment charges in non-comp expenses. Just would be helpful if you could kind of size that on what the nature of those charges relate to? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of kind of --.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">I didn't hear -- I heard that you referenced non-comp. I didn\u2019t hear the first part of what do you said there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">You said higher impairment charges within the non-comp line per your earnings release?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">It\u2019s not a material number. We just called it out. But as you know, every quarter we mark-to-market the balance sheet and so assets sitting on the balance sheet. But this quarter it wasn\u2019t material, so roughly about $50 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">50 million? Okay, thank you. And then just lastly for me. You spoke about strengthening your relative position across all your businesses. I guess the equities business is probably the one place where there has been some market share slip based on reported numbers anyway and I appreciate those numbers. I know it\u2019s really apples-to-apples. But was just curious to -- maybe help us frame Goldman\u2019s competitive position in that business and kind of a longer-term outlook.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So, with respect to longer term outlook and our sense of position in the marketplace, we couldn\u2019t be more pleased with it. We measure the business by our engagement with clients and our ability to deliver and that\u2019s in the prime brokerage business, in our global footprint, our ability to provide electronic solutions in terms of trading, commit capital and obviously our connectivity with our banking team in terms of driving capital markets transaction. And so from a franchise perspective, we couldn\u2019t feel better about it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Quarter-to-quarter in terms of top line revenue, I know that\u2019s the data that you have available in terms of market share, not really the way we look at market share. We\u2019re much more focused, as I said, on delivering to clients and driving returns to the bottom line at the same time. And so, I think in terms of the long run, we feel quite good. But quarter-to-quarter you may see revenue move back and forth between us and our competitors, but it\u2019s not a big issue for us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thanks, Christian.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Good morning, Matt.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">You had a pretty big increase in the SLR, I think about 50 basis points versus last quarter and just trying to reconcile what drove that. I think some of it was the assets you actually brought down last quarter that helped the ratio, obviously had positive net income. But was there also a nice benefit from the final SLR rules?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So there were a whole host of things that drove it. We definitely got benefit from the final rules, about 10 basis points. But then when you go through, there was the balance sheet reduction which was [indiscernible]. So as you know, we took the balance sheet down in the second quarter, but it\u2019s daily averaging in the SLR and so you really didn't see that benefit translate through until the third quarter. And then there is other reductions that sort of -- there is other reductions in terms of CDS in the portfolio in terms of that and then obviously there was a capital, we reduced our significant financial institutional deduction, all these things are contributors in terms of driving the increase in ratio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I do think that the SLR is a good example of sort of our philosophy on how we approach regulatory reform. But as you know obviously there has been a significant improvement in that, 70 basis points over a fairly short period of time, and as you point out, 40 basis points in the quarter. We have found that by giving our people the tools, waiting till we see the final rule and then just really focused on complying with the rule, we can move the needle. So, this is just all about compliance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And where do you think you are on the optimization of that? Can you talk about obviously as you get compliance for Volcker, there will be a material benefit there. But what about just the other opportunities? You had a list of things with CDS and the other reductions. How much more, if any, is there of that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">It\u2019s funny. We don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t think we're thinking about it \u2013 it's not like a baseball game here in terms of where we are in the innings of how do we comply. I think the takeaway here is that the SLR is not a significant issue. As we talked about a year ago, it\u2019s much more reflective about complying with the rules. But this will be a process that will be ongoing. You mentioned the Volcker compliance. As you come out of the fund, again, we\u2019re talking about something that's forward looking to 2018. And if we can make those adjustments, we'd be well in excess of 5% today. But let\u2019s see how it goes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. And then just separately on getting compliance for Volcker, there's a lot of focus on that and what it might mean to your equity I&amp;L revenues. But I guess as you think about replenishing the investments with Volcker compliant investments, how is that landscape? Because as I talk to investors, there is some concern that new investment opportunities may not be as good as they\u2019ve been in the past. But what do you think about the outlook for deploying capital in the Volcker compliant manners right now?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So, as we talked about before, there is a number of ways that we can use our capital. And as it comes out of the funds, capital is fungible. And so we will have the ability to continue to invest in Volcker compliant funds, use our balance sheet, other Volcker compliant structures. And so we feel like we have enough flexibility in terms of redeploying that capital. And of course I think this is the critical point. If the opportunities aren't there, obviously we can look to redeploy it into other areas of the firm that demand the capital or we can look to return it to the shareholders. So from that perspective.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So for us it's all about the process and the environment. As we discuss the environment as being a good one for harvesting, we have been able to put capital to work in certain parts of the world and our global footprint certainly gives us an advantage in terms of seeing opportunities. But it's always been -- investing and lending has always been a very long-term long cycle initiative and we will be very disciplined about the returns. If the opportunities are there and they make sense, we will deploy the capital. If not, we will be disciplined and we will wait.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. And we will probably get it in the 10-Q, but you have the level of direct investments now and maybe how that compares to a year or two ago just to show how quickly that's been ramping? </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I don't have the year or two ago numbers. Dane can follow up with you offline. But it's been obviously a bit of a high class problem as we've been harvesting, values have been increasing. We can come back to you and get to the numbers. The I&amp;L balance sheet at the end of the second quarter was roughly 71 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay, all right. Thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Hey, thanks. That was my questions. I'm good.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Hey Betsy, thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Good morning, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Good morning, Guy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Securities services had some pretty attractive quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year revenue growth. I was wondering if you can just help us understand the dynamic there, especially in the context of what you had done last quarter in terms of bringing down some of the securities funding transactions, second part, of that stuff.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I think what you are seeing there may be the allocation of the gain that I referenced as it related to the retirement of the trust preferred securities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Oh, got it. It's there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yes. So as you know, we don't have a corporate cost center. So just a philosophy and a discipline, we allocate out all cost to all the businesses. In this particular case, there was a gain related to funding. So the Institutional Client Services business, the fixed income equity, they are the biggest consumers of balance sheet and liquidity, so they also get the benefit of the gains. And so that's actually really -- I think when you look at it, you will see that that's probably it. We detail it out in the earnings release.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So that aside then maybe you can give us a sense for what is the impact on that business of some of the changes that you made with respect to bringing down the balance sheet in the second quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So that's a good question. So in terms of how we looked at it, it was really, as I said, I would describe it as a two-part process. One is pretty simple and is mathematical. One of the easiest things to do in terms of response to leverage task is actually just to rank the balance sheet in the businesses from lower ROA to higher ROA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">The second part of the exercise is a really high touch exercise where it's engagement in the trenches going through and working with clients and really finding out where we are providing value and where it may need our balance sheet and that's the nuance of the part of the exercise that we went through [indiscernible] and then we will continue to go through. But so far the client engagement [indiscernible] is one of our strongest franchise businesses, so it feels quite good.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Thanks for that. The other question that I had and it goes really back to some of the liquidity points that were being asked about earlier. People have been worried about the impact of the street reducing the liquidity it provides to investors for a while. We heard a lot more about it in the last two weeks of the third quarter. At the same time we know that in the third quarter the [indiscernible] had to begin to make daily reports to regulators based I guess on Volcker and some of the liquidity regs at a pretty deep level of granularity and I was wondering if you felt that this has had any impact broadly on the attractiveness of providing liquidity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I would say no. It's certainly not a Goldman Sachs and I would imagine not the case across the market, although I don\u2019t have any visibility into our competitors. You are right when you say that the data requirements in the first submission that went in right around Labor Day, it's a pretty significant amount of data. I actually think that speaks to the opposite reaction function and I will tell you why. You can't create that data overnight. We had to invest quite a bit of talent mind share, technology, operations front office time and federation time in building the systems. And so that's been a process that's been underway I would assume for all of our competitors and certainly for us since the rule came out. So it wouldn't be as though you'd show up reporting and somehow you would change your profile. I don\u2019t know, that seems like a stretch to me.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I think again it's much more -- it's the collection of the rule sets. We did see increased sales in treasuries, we've seen stress -- and I'm talking about a normal market functioning times, not in stress market functioning times -- definitely where balance sheet has felt scarce. And I think under periods where clients want more liquidity, it may be more difficult to find. But we\u2019ll see how this all shapes out. Again, the impact of the collective rule sets of all the rules, balance sheet, whatever, risk-weighted assets liquidity, it\u2019s pretty enormous and I don\u2019t think we can only have positive effects from that over the next three, four, five, 10 years. I wish that was the case.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And when you add all of that up and going back also to the pricing of securities services and other securities financing transactions, are you in real time seeing that the scarcity value of balance sheet is driving re-pricing that will be favorable to you presumably?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Well, I don\u2019t know. We\u2019ve never been firm that's first and foremost competed on price. We like to compete on content and we like to compete on the ability to provide liquidity, which may mean being the best price at any point in time for our clients. But our clients understand, they\u2019re very knowledgeable and are increasingly knowledgeable about the regulatory constraints that are on us and really the entire industry where we all have the same rule set. And so as the market responds, I just think everyone needs to be more disciplined and some of that will depend on where your return hurdles are. If our return hurdles are higher than someone else's, then we may be more disciplined than the next market participant I have to say.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thanks, Harvey. That\u2019s really helpful color. I appreciate it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Just maybe a couple of questions on the regulatory side that I missed it. Did you disclose your LCR or are you over 100% at this point?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">We didn\u2019t disclose the number. We\u2019re still digesting all the data as you know. But yes, we\u2019re in excess of the minimum requirement.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And we would expect given all the focus we've put on liquidity here.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Right. No, that\u2019s fair. And then just maybe a follow-up question on just sort of the Tarullo commentary and the impact and you just talked about how ROE becomes high ROE hurdles. If you think about his focus about wholesale funding potentially a charge on top of the current SIFI charge, he seems to be specifically focused on repo and even the match book. How do you -- do you think is it just too early to start worrying about it because you mentioned you\u2019re not -- you think your balance sheet is fine or do you think is it something that\u2019s going to be an increasingly something you have to focus on and may continue to shrink that market or change the way you do it, just some color there. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So I think it\u2019s definitely -- and we haven\u2019t even seen a proposed rule and as you know our philosophy around these things is we\u2019ve seen and we will continue to assume that regulators will give the marketplace basically a good glide path to adjust to rule changes. And so we would never react or change the business methodology to commentary. We wait to see the rule. We\u2019d engage in an active dialog on creating a constructive rule.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Clearly we\u2019ll be focused on the impact on markets. It would be very interesting to see where this discussion heads. As you know, and I don\u2019t want to address too much, but as you know the SIFI surcharges are really at their core designed around macro prudential regulation, not micro prudential regulation. And so when you look at our proportion of wholesale funding as a percentage of the marketplace, you can argue we're a lot smaller than many of our large universal bank peers. So we'll really see how the rule plays up. But we\u2019ll engage in an active dialog with the regulators just to ensure that we get the most thoughtful rule in investing for the marketplace and our clients.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay, fair enough. And maybe just one other quickly on the asset management business. You\u2019ve done a good job in turning around and generating positive flows in fixed income and equities. Is the lack of positive flows in alternatives simply your realizations? And if so, if that\u2019s the case, when do you see -- I assume that\u2019s a higher margin area -- when do you see that kind of inflection point where you start to see net flows turn positive?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Sorry. Could you say that again?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Well I\u2019m just trying to think of your alternative AUM.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your net flows have been zero, but I assume that's because you have outflows from -- </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes, we can break it down for you after the call and Dane can give it to you. But basically what you\u2019re seeing there is the harvesting that you\u2019ve seen in the private equity, but you\u2019ve actually seen growth away from that in the other alternative asset categories. But we can break it down for you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay, that\u2019s great. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">The growth has been pretty good.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Hey, good morning, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Hi, how are you?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Good. Quick question following up on one of Jim\u2019s questions there. So your LCR in excess of the minimum, is that the fully phased in minimum or the first minimum threshold of 80%?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">No, sorry, that\u2019s fully phased in.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. Thanks. And then just a question here on the market and sort of your comments to open up the call. Clearly this has been sort of a tough year for hedge funds and October hasn\u2019t been good either. Just thinking about your business and the leverage to financial players, do you think that we could end the year with a real serious withdrawal risk from some of these, some of big portion of your client base? And did that at all impact your decision to adjust the comp ratio here in the third quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">No, that's not how we do that. I think the composition was really driven by the improvement in top line revenues and the operating leverage we gained by managing our expenses. I think volatility comes in different flavors. A couple of months ago people were saying volatility will never return to the marketplace. And as I said now people feel like we have too much volatility. And so I think there is healthy periods of volatility and less healthy periods and really what we\u2019ve seen in the last 48 hours is concentrated position, liquidation obviously triggered by stop loss selling in multiple markets. And at times as we\u2019ve always seen, selling can beget selling.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Our hedge funds, asset managers and institutional clients are an important part of our focus at Goldman Sachs. But we\u2019ll just stay close to our clients during this period. We don\u2019t think about it in terms of days or weeks, in terms of the performance of our clients. It\u2019s really just a commitment to the long run.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">That\u2019s fair. Thanks for that. And then I guess last one for me and it seems like we chat about this every quarter so I wouldn\u2019t want to disappoint you. But I kind of hear you in the equities business that you don\u2019t want to get worked up over quarterly volatility. But it seems as though the equities business on a revenue basis has been losing share for a period in excess of a year. And while it\u2019s certainly encouraging that engagement with clients remains solid, when do you think that that translates into revenue? And I guess when do you become concerned that the engagement is there ultimately to lead the revenue? So, when do you become concerned about that not translating, I guess?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So, look, it\u2019s an important question. And as I said before, we run the business for a focus on our clients and then ultimately margins and returns. In any given quarter quarter-to-quarter you can see noise. In this quarter \u2013 again I don't have visibility into our competitors -- in this quarter we certainly, as I mentioned in the [earnings release] (ph) we had a more challenging part of a cash business and equities client institution, so a bit more challenging for us in blocks. Again, I don\u2019t have visibility. But I think if you step back and you look at Goldman Sachs, I think actually you\u2019re seeing it translate into returns. So, when you eliminate for the quarter an 11.2% ROE for the year-to-date, I think we\u2019re doing whatever we can actually to drive to the bottom line. So I think, I actually think you are seeing it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. Thanks, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Steven Chubak - Nomura</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Hey, Harvey. Good morning. </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Hey. Good morning, Steven.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Steven Chubak - Nomura</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So my first question pertains to the topic of operational risk. And digging into some of the Pillar 3 disclosures for you and your peers and if you\u2019re thinking of actually running at a much lower level as a percentage of RWA at roughly 15% I believe, at least as of Q2, which compares to the remaining universals or at least U.S. domiciled universals running closer to 25 to 30, I don\u2019t know if you can clarify because that calculation is really determined based on the industry rather than company specific event risk, what\u2019s driving that delta?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So, you\u2019re right to say we have less. But I think it really correlates more to the fact that we\u2019re just a less complex financial institution than many of our peers. We don\u2019t have the payment systems, we don\u2019t have the consumer banking side of the business, we don\u2019t have that like a lot of our universal peers have. And also as you know this was also driven by loss experience. And when you look at our loss experience over the last several years, it\u2019s been significantly lower than many of our peers. I think that it\u2019s a pretty straightforward answer.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Steven Chubak - Nomura</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay, fair enough. And then just switching gears over to I&amp;L. We\u2019ve been having more conversations with investors which suggest continued reluctance to ascribe as much value to the contributions simply given a lack of earnings visibility tied to the portfolio again, which at least from my point of view I'd argue it dilutes the contribution from some sustainable fee streams you have there because of lending tied to the private banks. I didn't know given the lack of credit that some have been willing to ascribe to merchant banking and the portfolio gains whether you'd consider updating or amendments to your segment disclosure, at least within I&amp;L, to at the very least disaggregated the merchant banking portion from higher multiple and sustainable revenue streams tied to lending activities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So, maybe I think let's step back for a second. So in terms of how we think about the Investing &amp; Lending businesses, if you look back over the history of time -- and again we approach this over the long term -- it\u2019s been a significant builder of book value and certainly a valuable contribution the way that we've partnered with clients over many many years and we do think we have some competitive advantages in that business in terms of our global footprint and ability to source transactions. And so I think its economic value in terms of its contribution as the margin you can see and it speaks for itself.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I think it\u2019s pro-cyclical. So there is always a discussion about its value in different times of a cycle. But we run it as a pro-cyclical business. And so, I think the question of financial statement presentation I\u2019m happy to take offline with you and Dane. As you know we went through a very thorough review as part of our business standards committee process to actually design our financial statements in a way that actually provide an increased clarity around the various business lines. But we\u2019re always looking to improve that clarity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And so \u2013 look, I think we\u2019re better for having this financial disclosure. At the time we got very positive feedback for it. I don\u2019t want to close and be [quippy] (ph) with you, but yeah, do I think generally speaking the marketplace is undervalued than Goldman Sachs' business, yes. But I don't if it's necessarily the result of the financial statements, but we are happy to look at it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">All right, fair enough. No, I appreciate the color, Harvey, and thank you for taking my questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question is from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Good morning, Matt. Good morning, Harvey. Thanks for taking my question. You mentioned you certainly had some nice improvement in the SLR ratio quarter-over-quarter. Have you said or disclosed what buffer you might have ultimately above the 5% target that everybody is focused on? We have several conversations with investors trying to guess that or estimate that for various companies.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yeah. No, we haven't focused on a buffer yet. Remember that the balance sheet is very dynamic. And so as we comply with the rule and you can see we are making significant progress, but we haven't determined any buffer and obviously we have a couple of years. Again, I will underscore that as we take our investments out of funds, if you were actually to translate those same assets onto the balance sheet, that gets us to a 5.2, 5.3 level anyway. So there is almost a natural tailwind that creates that. But we will constantly reassess and define all these buffers as we get all the final rules.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay, that's helpful. And you mentioned the backlog being so strong and as a combination of a number of different businesses and I am going to ask -- when you talk to the folks particularly in the fixed income side of banking, if the rates actually do go up at some point, how are they thinking about potential future global debt issuance in a period of rising rates given that there has been so much issuance over the past few years at declining rate? I realize it's hard to figure out given the nature of the business tends to focus in many ways and sort of drive by issuance, but how are they thinking about the potential for that type of volume over the next couple of years? </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Look, my crystal ball on these kind of things has never been particularly good. So remember it was a year plus ago we were getting asked questions when we first hit a new record in debt underwriting a year plus ago about the end of the debt underwriting cycle. And so, and again in the second quarter we had another record this year. So very difficult to predict. I think a lot of it depends on the environment associated around the rate increases. I think if it's again a return to normalized rates around the globe where we don't have so much incredible essential bank intervention and that's associated with global growth, I think you could see growth in many economies around the world, I think you will see an increase in capital markets activity because you will see companies want to issue debt as they grow, as they move away from being financed by local banks. So I think it will be environment centric. If you saw -- part of what we've seen is you see large M&amp;A transactions and the M&amp;A environment is quite active, you see a lot of related debt issuance. So I definitely think there is something of a reaction function over short periods of times to rate levels, I think a lot of it will be correlated with global growth.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Thanks very much. And then just a follow-up for me. The 9 billion of the remainder of investments, Volcker related investments you need to move out of overtime, it sounds like that number really hasn't changed much since the second quarter. Is that what we should understand from your earlier comments?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yes, that's right. It's actually right around 8 billion now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay, thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Devin Ryan - JMP Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Most of my questions have been asked. But maybe just a question on acquisitions and now that we are getting a little bit better picture on the capital and regulatory framework. When you think about where you'd like to expand the business over the next several years, does the door open more to thinking about doing acquisitions or really is there anything that could become more interesting kind of growing inorganically as you guys think about the go forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Look, I think we are the leading merger and acquisition advisory firm in the world. It would be some inconsistent philosophically for us. I just think it would be inconsistent with our core being if we say we weren't willing to consider acquisitions. And so I think you should assume philosophically and culturally that as a management team we'd consider any acquisition if it was accretive in any area of our firm. I do think that as you point out, I do think that the ongoing nature of the regulatory environment probably just makes them more difficult for the industry generally. But we will see overtime. But we are always open minded. And having said all that, I think we've benefited as a firm over many years by keeping our culture intact and doing nothing major. But you've seen us do bolt-on acquisitions from time-to-time. So that's how I'd describe it philosophically.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Devin Ryan - JMP Securities</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay, helpful. And then just I guess staying on the M&amp;A theme, just as you mentioned being the leader. When you look at the backlog, are you seeing further divergence around trends within the U.S. and Europe and particularly given I guess maybe the divergence is in the economies right now? Or does this feel like the European M&amp;A backlog and what you are guys are seeing over there in terms of the outlook is pulling off the bottom? I know the U.S. has kind of led the charge there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So in terms of \u2013 there's nothing really material to share with you in terms of the shape of the geographic backlog. As you know, merger transaction is the most significant decision a CEO, his or her management team and a board makes in a life cycle of a company. And so these decisions tend to come into place over many, many years in terms of how they\u2019re executed. At the margin, obviously markets can drive thinking. Sentiment has been a big factor a couple of years ago in preventing transactions from happening. And then when sentiments shifted, you've obviously seen a huge uptick in activity. But there is nothing I would comment on with respect to global activity. Certainly growth, if we see big disparity in growth around the globe, that may be an influencer, but there's nothing to share with you today.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Devin Ryan - JMP Securities</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. All right, thank you. </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Hi, good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Marty, your line is open. Please check to see if it's on mute.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Well, there we go. Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I want to make sure that as we looked at the comp ratio, when we typically get these adjustments as we get towards the end of the year which you\u2019re saying reflect operational improvements and efficiencies, is there any thought about permanently kind of incorporating this throughout the year so that it seems more sustainable and less kind of temporary and year-end adjustment?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Again, there is no change in philosophy on how we\u2019ll this. It\u2019s always going to be a quarter-to-quarter assessment. It\u2019s our best estimate for where we stand at that particular point in the year. And as I said, it reflects all the factors you\u2019ve heard us talk about.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And then you mentioned on the debt underwriting, the regulatory pressure on leverage lending and maybe some impact there. Does that feel a little bit more permanent as you move forward given the stance that we\u2019ve seen talked about openly by the regulators?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So the comment I made about leverage actually didn\u2019t have anything to do with that. That was actually just transaction specific quarter-to-quarter. As I mentioned, the backlog was up at the end of the third quarter across all categories.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Specifically what you\u2019re talking about though, it would be interesting to see how that will evolve. I know market participants, regulators, certainly all those at Goldman Sachs are very focused on the compliance with that and that will be very interesting to see over the next couple of years what impact that has in terms of markets where those transactions get financed, at what leverage levels, and that will be evolving story, we\u2019ll keep eye on.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And then lastly, the $0.05 dividend increase, while still in that kind of 10% range. Your earnings have grown much higher than that over the last year, revenues were up much more than that, excess capital was abundant, your payout ratio is low and your dividend yield is still relatively low. So seems like you had come headroom to maybe potentially go up a little bit more than that. I just didn't know what what your thought was there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So when we assess capital return, as you know our preferred mechanism for capital return is really from share repurchase. We think it allows us to be very dynamic in terms of responding to our clients' needs and market conditions. And so while the dividend has certainly come up meaningfully, I think you should still assume that Goldman Sachs will rely on share repurchase as its predominant tool.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Got you. And humor me for one more question. If we look at the market commentary you said with the pain and the volatility coupled with the kind of regulatory Volcker kind of compliance move and your VaR coming down, do you feel like as a market maker you're kind of hamstrung in ability to kind of help the market go through some of these transitions now given all the new regulations?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I just want to be clear with that. You may have misheard me or I may have misheard you. There was nothing that I saw about Volcker compliance that I think is at this stage preventing people from providing liquidity. Volcker has been pretty visible for a while now. </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">The comment I was making is that it\u2019s very hard to assess the collective impact of leverage rules, increases in risk-weighted assets reductions in balance sheet globally in terms of the entire industry and what that means for market liquidity. And we\u2019ve certainly seen areas where people \u2013 I haven't looked at all the data, but most firms at this stage have actually shrunk their match books. I think I\u2019m pretty accurate in saying that. And so all market participants, regulators included, have been asking themselves the question of when we were seeing increases in sales and treasuries whether how much of that was driven by market makers' inability or lack of appetite or not being able to position balance sheet in terms of providing that liquidity at important times.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">We'll have to see again how all this evolves. When you look at Goldman Sachs today given the level of our capital ratios, which I described earlier in the call, we certainly have the capacity to deliver for our clients when they need it. </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Your next question comes from the line Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Brian Kleinhanzl - KBW</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Hi, Brian.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Brian Kleinhanzl - KBW</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Just quick question, when you look at some of the regulations coming down the road here and also funding surcharge being one of them and the NSFR, both of those would benefit from a greater level of deposit funding on the balance sheet in effect. Are you thinking about growing deposits currently? And if you are, kind of are you thinking about organically or through acquisition or are you just not going to think about it at all?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So we obviously focus on -- I think in the context at the moment, this will be very interesting because, you mentioned NSFR so let's just use that as an example. I think as an example of a rule and a concept, I think again that falls into the bucket of a good concept because you want good asset liability management across the industry. We spend a huge amount of time on asset liability management the way that we look at secure funding and how we manage our balance sheet and we run a very conservative profile in terms of how we manage that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">With respect in this rule, it will be very interesting because we haven\u2019t even seen the Basel rule yet. I think the big question will be again, when you add this rule on to other rules if there are some long term impact on market liquidity so obviously clients and we will be very focused on that. As this goes to the rule-making process because you specifically make just a deposit, it will be very interesting when you get to the U.S. because as you know in the U.S. it\u2019s a different legal structure in terms of your ability to use deposit funding for certain businesses. And so not only do we need to wait to see the Basel rule, but then we\u2019ll need to see the U.S. rule and how they incorporate just a different legal structure that exists in the U.S. So we\u2019ll have to see how it goes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Brian Kleinhanzl - KBW</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay. And just a separate question on the ECM backlog. Is there any specific reason that\u2019s kind of driving strength there? I think you said last quarter Europe was strong in underwriting but this quarter has that changed?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">No, it's just a normal part of the marketplace in terms of people coming to the markets and raising capital for a variety of needs. But there is no key driver.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Brian Kleinhanzl - KBW</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay, great. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And at this time there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">So again, since there are no more questions, I would like to take a moment to thank all of you for joining the call. Hopefully I and other members of the senior management will get to see you many of you in the coming months. Certainly if there is any additional questions, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to Dane. And otherwise, enjoy the rest of your day. Look forward to speaking with you on the fourth quarter call. Take care.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call.

(NYSE:<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GS\" title=\"Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\">GS</a>)</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Q1 2014 Earnings Conference Call</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">April 17, 2014, 09:30 AM ET</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Executives</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Dane Holmes - Head of Investor Relation</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Harvey Schwartz - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Analysts</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Glenn Schorr - ISI Group</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Mike Mayo - CLSA</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Steven Chubak - Nomura</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Brennan Hawken - UBS</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning. My name is Dennis and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. This call is being recorded today, April 17, 2014. Thank you. Mr. Holmes, you may begin your conference.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Dane Holmes</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm's belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain and outside of the firm's control. The firm's actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our current annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 2013.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our investment banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk weighted assets and global core excess. And you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that is posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">This audio cast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Our Chief Financial Officer, Harvey Schwartz, will now review the firm's results. Harvey?</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thanks, Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I'll walk you through our first quarter results. I am obviously happy to answer any questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Net revenues were $9.3 billion, net earnings $2 billion, earnings per diluted share were $4.02 and our annualized return on common equity was 10.9%. The first quarter reinforced two consistent themes that we have seen over the past few years. First, the continued uncertainty around the strength of the global economic recovery; and second, the dominant role that central banks play in driving broad economic activity and capital market sentiment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">With respect to the first, market participants struggle to reconcile mixed economic data across different regional economies that weigh the prospect of a strengthening U.S economy against an improved, but still relatively weak European economy and a slowing economy in Asia. As it relates to the second theme, discussions among market participants are also centered on the potential for additional central bank activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">In United States, the focus remain on the pace and potential magnitude of further tapering to the Federal Reserves bond buying program. In Europe, the market attempted to weigh the potential for either negative interest rates or the introduction of an asset purchasing program. In Asia, market participants questioned whether the upcoming hike in Japan's consumption tax would weaken positive momentum and require the Bank of Japan to boost its quantitative easing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Given the uncertainty surrounding the outlook for central bank activity, it is understandable that overall client sentimental risk appetite was subdued. With this backdrop, we are all reminded of the importance of a strong and diversified business. With respect to the client franchise at Goldman Sachs, we continue to see strong relative positioning and performance across all of our businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Within investment banking, we maintained our market leading position in completed M&amp;A. We advised on 31 value transactions, valued at $1 billion or more, the highest number in the industry. We helped underwrite $55 billion in global equity offerings during the quarter, making us the market leader. We also helped to bring a $194 billion of high yield and investment grade debt offerings to market, which is a quarterly record for debt underwriting volume.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Within investment management, total assets under supervision reached a record $1.08 trillion, up 12% over the past year. Despite market headwinds, our performance within FICC demonstrates the benefits of offering our clients a diversified product suite, meeting their needs across rates, credit, currencies, mortgages and commodities. Whether it's from a business, products or regional perspective, the value of diversity was reinforced in the first quarter of 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Now, I'll discuss each of our businesses. In investment banking, we produced first quarter net revenues of $1.8 billion, up 4% from the fourth quarter. This was our highest quarterly performance since 2007. While investment banking backlog declined from yearend levels, it is up significantly compared to this time last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">First quarter advisory revenues were $682 million, up 17% sequentially. We advise on a number of significant transactions that closed during the first quarter, including Vodafone's $130 billion disposal of its U.S. group, whose principal asset is its 45% interest in Verizon Wireless. Cole Real Estate Investments' $10.9 billion sale through American Realty Capital Properties and Bristol-Myers Squibb sale of its global diabetes business to AstraZeneca for up to $4.3 billion, plus future royalties.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We also advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the first quarter. These include Safeway's $9.2 billion sale to an investor group, led by Cerberus Capital Management, Hutchison Whampoa's $5.7 billion sale of a 25% stake in A.S. Watson to Temasek and Foster Wheeler's $2.9 billion sale to Amec.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Moving to underwriting. Net revenues were $1.1 billion in the first quarter, down 3% compared to record fourth quarter results. Equity underwriting revenues of $437 million was 30% lower, as industry-wide activity declined in the first quarter, particularly for IPOs. Year-to-date, Goldman Sachs ranked first in global equity and equity-related common stock offerings in IPOs. Debt underwriting revenues increased 29% sequentially to $660 million due to higher issuance activity in both investment grade and leverage finance markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">During the first quarter we were committed to meeting our clients' diverse financing needs. Whether it was McKesson's $5.5 billion bridge loan and $4.1 billion investment grade notes offering or Hong Kong Electric Investments' $3.1 billion IPO or X2 Resources' $2.5 billion private placement.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Turning to institutional client services, which comprises both our FICC and equity businesses, net revenues were $4.4 billion in the first quarter, up 31% compared to the weaker fourth quarter. FICC client execution net revenues were $2.9 billion in the first quarter. Excluding DVA, net revenues were up 50% sequentially.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Rates and mortgages were both up significantly relative to the weak forth quarter, although client activity and volatility remain relatively muted. Credit improved slightly and was supported by stable credit markets. Commodities revenues improved significantly relative to a weak fourth quarter, as market volatility and client activity increases. Currency was modestly lower sequentially.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Equities includes equities client execution, commissions and fees and security services. Net revenues for the first quarter were $1.6 billion. Excluding DVA, results were down 7% sequentially. Equities client execution net revenues, up $416 million, were down significantly due to less favorable market condition in certain areas, including emerging markets in Asia, particularly Japan.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Commissions and fees were $828 million, up 11% relative to the fourth quarter on solid cash volumes. Security services generated net revenues of $352 million, up 4% sequentially. Turning to risk, average daily VaR in the first quarter was $82 million, roughly consistent with fourth quarter levels.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Moving on to our investing and lending activities. Collectively, these businesses produced net revenues of $1.5 billion in the first quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of $702 million, primarily reflecting company-specific events, including divestitures and pending IPOs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $597 million and benefited from net gains on certain investments and net interest income. Other revenues of $230 million include revenues from the firm's consolidated investments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In investment management we reported first quarter net revenues of $1.6 billion. Management and other fees were roughly flat sequentially at $1.2 billion. Incentive fees were largely driven by performance fee related to the sale of an investment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">During the first quarter, assets under supervision increased $41 billion to a record $1.08 trillion. This growth was driven by record long-term net inflows of $40 billion, largely in fixed income assets. During the quarter, long-term net flows were strong across each of our client distribution channels, institutional, high net worth and third party. During the quarter, we also had market appreciation of $14 billion, largely in fixed income and equity assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Now, let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as benefit, was accrued at a compensation to net revenues ratio of 43%, which is consistent with the accrual in the first quarter of 2013.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">First quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.3 billion, 24% lower than the fourth quarter and down modestly from the first quarter of 2013. The fourth quarter included higher litigation and regulatory expenses, higher charitable contributions and higher impairment charges on consolidated investment entities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Total staff at the end of the first quarter was approximately 32,600, down 1% from yearend 2013. Our effective tax rate was 32.7% for the first quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In terms of capital, there are a number of items to cover. First, during the quarter we repurchased 10.3 million shares of common stock for a total cost of $1.7 billion. These repurchases reflected the completion of our 2013 capital plan. As previously announced, the Federal Reserve did not object to our revised 2014 proposed capital actions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">With respect to our regulatory capital ratio, the Federal Reserve has approved the firm to come off the parallel run. And therefore, starting in the second quarter, our capital ratios are determined under the transitional provisions of Basel III. As a result, the transitional ratios are not only the most relevant, but also a better assessment of our risk-based capitalization.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Our Basel III common equity Tier I ratio on a transitional basis was 11.3%, using the advanced approach. Under the standardized approach, our transitional ratio was 10.9%. Risk-weighted assets under the advanced approach are approximately $600 billion, $355 billion in credit risk, $155 billion in market risk and $90 billion in operational risk.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Let me make a few brief points on the supplementary leverage ratio. Given that the proposed rule hasn't been finalized and won't take effect until 2018, to date, we have not taken any significant actions. When we have a final rule, there are multiple options that we can pursue.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On the capital side of the equation, our regulatory capital levels benefit from a natural tailwind over time as we comply with the Volcker Rule. As you know, we have investments and funds, where we invest alongside our clients. Under the Volcker Rule, we are required to significantly reduce our level of fund investments, which currently creates an approximately $9 billion capital reduction.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">With respect to the asset side of the equation, there are also steps we can take if needed. For example, as of yearend, we had over $260 billion of asset associated with secured client financing activities. These are generally lower-risk collateralized assets. We can ultimately decide if needed to reduce the lower returning portion within these balances.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Regarding the new proposal, our best estimate today is 4.2%, including the capital impact of reducing our fund investments to comply with the Volcker Rule, we estimate it would be 4.7%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">To sum it up, we feel confident about our ability to comply in advance of 2018, given the variety of actions that we can take. And we look forward to working with regulators to pursue the goal of enhanced safety and soundness, while continuing to serve our clients and support economic growth.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Before I take questions, let me leave you with some closing thoughts. Our performance in the first quarter is reflective of the ongoing challenges facing the broader marketplace, as the global economy continues its slow recovery. This is being counterbalanced by the continued strength and diversity of our global client franchise.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">A sluggish, yet steady improvement in the global economy should drive greater confidence and the durability of the recovery. In response, we would anticipate that market sentiment would improve, which should ultimately drive from our client activity and greater risk appetite.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">And the management team, we're focused on two primary goals. First, to focus the bulk of our resources on serving our clients and in the process grow our single-most valuable asset, our global franchise.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Our second goal is to take a disciplined approach to adjusting and reengineering our businesses, so that we are well-position to protect returns in the current environment, and more importantly maximize returns, when a more favorable environment emerges. Simply stated, the goal is to consistently provide superior results for you, our shareholders, across the cycle.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Thank you again for dialing in. And now, I'm happy to answer your questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p4\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">(Operator Instructions) And your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with ISI Group.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI Group</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">So taking a look at I&amp;L and maybe we should only focus on the equity side because I think most of the debt in lending will stick. At last look there was about $20 billion in there, $16 billion of it private equity. And given that you reiterated the $9 billion of disallowed -- this is a question, sorry. I'm assuming that you had some realizations in the quarter, but market list still has you at the same level of equity. I'm going somewhere with this, because I'm curious to see how you go about winding that down and getting in Volcker compliance over the next couple years and what the backup plan is, if you don't sell it off? In other words, can you spin some off? Sorry for the long question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">I understand. That's obviously an important question, Glenn, thanks. So I think the right way to think about the Volcker compliance is, if you look at the K, we roughly had at the end of 2013, $14 billion of investments in funds. Now, we're obviously coinvested with our clients in all those funds, and those funds are not just private equity, they are private equity, real estate, debt funds, et cetera. And the important thing is really to focus on the $14 billion now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Obviously, there is a process where we can apply for extensions for two years, which basically takes us out three years in terms of compliance. But just to size it for you, I think it worth breaking down the $14 billion. And so if you start with $14 billion, you can immediately take off $2 billion, what I'll refer to as permitted investments, that brings you down to $12 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">And then, you can take off another billion that relates to investments in fund that we're already in a process of redeeming, hedge funds and credit funds, where we have the flexibility to manage our own time path there. And so that takes you down another billion bringing you to $11 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Now within the $11 billion, obviously, for several quarters we've being in a harvesting mode and within the $11 billion, $2.5 billion is already public, but there maybe restrictions on sale down, et cetera. So when you add up all that math, the $14 billion at the end of last year, brings you down sub-9. And so the sub-9 is the number, we really have to manage. And again, we're investing alongside our clients in these funds.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI Group</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Moving on just a clean-up question related to CCAR. Your plan wasn't objected too, you got tons of capital and you keep producing more, so all those are good things. I'm curious to see, why you think you were so far off from the Fed in both PP&amp;R and R&amp;R and RWA. And I'm not agreeing with the Fed's projections, it's just, you had the biggest distance to the Fed and I'm curious on how you decompose that knowing that you don't have all the answers just yet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So that's an important question. So we obviously submitted a plan that we thought was significantly stressful and you can see that in our year-over-year numbers. We don't -- as you know, the Federal Reserve by design has created a process that is not transparent. They've communicated that very clearly. So it's difficult for us at this stage to reconcile our results with the Federal Reserve's results.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We'll obviously work with the Federal Reserve and the material they publish and we'll participate in their forums actively and we'll try and get better insights. I think an important takeaway here is, we certainly as a market participant, we're not encouraged necessarily to replicate their test.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">And so in the end they're regulator, we're the regulatee. And so if they see that their results are more severe than ours, it guides the process. And I think this window for modifying your capital actions, is a good part of the process, which we obviously participated in.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI Group</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">And last one is you've been able to put up ROEs in 10%, 11% range in an environment that I think you all would describe maybe a 5 out of 10, overall. So with your cost take out and your share count shrinkage, I'm assuming do you feel like you could do better than that over the cycle. I'm not necessarily forcing you for a goal over the cycle, but just curious to get your thoughts on what you can do in a little bit better times?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So over the last several years, as we talked about, we've been focused on a number of strategic initiatives, things like, obviously, growing our asset management business, and very focused as you know, on cost reduction and that really is strategically about building operating leverage into the business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">As we've done that through this part of the cycle, we've done it with an eye on finding the right balance, and by balance I mean is, we're obviously running these businesses for years and decades. And so as we're getting more efficient in creating operating leverage, we need to make sure that we protect that franchise. And I think this quarter's results really showed that diversity and the strength that our franchise, whether you're look at investment banking, asset management et cetera.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So I think we found that balance, the right balance so far. Now, if we were to get significant tailwinds and a pickup in activity, we're very confident that we would participate in that significantly. So there is a lot of operating leverage in the enterprise. And with respect to our ROE, again, on an absolute basis, it's not what we want to be able to produce for our shareholders. But on a relative basis, it looks pretty good.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Just going back to the Volcker on the equity exposure. So you went through, how do we should think about the $14 billion running-off over time and addressing that, but I guess how quickly and how big you rebuild the direct investment book that I think is still Volcker-compliant?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So it's not as much about speed of rebuilding. And as you know, we've never approached capital deployment about speed. It will all be driven by opportunity set. So that's the way we think about all of our businesses. As capital will comes out of those funds, it can be redeployed and obviously can be redeployed anywhere or it can be return to the shareholders, if we don't think the opportunity set offers the best. So over time, this would be completely driven by the opportunity set.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So if you had to take a guess, looking out, I don't know three, five years, does the overall equity book get back to about where it is here or I would think a little smaller, but maybe not a lot smaller?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">It'd be impossible for me to say. Again, there will be maybe opportunities that are more driven by the real estate cycle versus others. And I don't know, my crystal ball barely works for a week. It definitely doesn't work that well for three or five years. But I wish I had one that did.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">And then just on the comp ratio, looking out the rest of this year. I think last year you changed up a little bit. You kept it steady in the first half and then brought it down a little bit in 3Q, and brought it down again in 4Q. Just any comments on how you're thinking about the timing of phase-in of the comp ratio??</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So as always, in this quarter, it's our best estimate for the year. And we'll evaluate it as we go through the year. And again, really the philosophy in compensation hasn't changed at Goldman Sachs since the day I got here. It's all going to be again the process driven by performance of the firm, and business units and the individuals, and obviously our management of expenses and the returns we want to provide to shareholders. But right now it's our best estimate.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Your next question is from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Harvey, given all the debate around the cash equities market structure and the role of high-frequency trading, just curious to get your updated thoughts on transfer to electronic trading business, particularly the future of the Sigma X platform?.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So we've been obviously an active market participant in the dialogue. Gary Cohn, as I'm sure you saw, published an op-ed several weeks ago. Our focus on the equity market structure isn't specifically around high-frequency trading necessarily. It's really about the fact that over the last 10-years plus, the market evolution, speed of execution has just gotten ahead of the market infrastructure and the market plumbing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">And so we're very focused on working with all market participants and regulators to ensure that the market infrastructure catches up with the speed. And there is other things in Gary's op-ed that I will refer you to, but that's the primary message. With respect to our own Sigma X platform, I know there has been some things in news. We have no strategic plans for Sigma X at this stage.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Jut switching over to FICC. Just curious as to what happened to the credit business. Your commentary on a year-over-year decline, kind of contrast with peers while speaking to strength there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So obviously from a debt underwriting perspective, I know your question was specifically about credit, but from a debt underwriting perspective very strong quarter for us I think by any measure, breadth of transactions as I highlighted and certainly relative to opportunity in the marketplace. In terms of any one quarter and credit, I have no insight into the competitors. It's been like a reasonably solid quarter for us in credit, so there really are no major takeaways there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">First question. I think you gave like some updated numbers around SLR, and I just want to make sure I understand. I know before there was sort of that estimate of greater than 5, but the rules weren't finalized. I guess now you're just in, you got the finalized or mostly finalized rules 4.2, but if you got out of some of those funds you get to 4.7. And I just getting from 4.7 to above the 5, just if you could mention like some of the things, obviously there is earnings power, you mentioned some of the repo part of the business, but I just wanted to understand kind of what's the map in terms of getting there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So if I wasn't clear, let me just clarify. So the 5 wasn't that move to 4.2. The 4.2 was a reference to the proposal that just came out, which incorporates the larger denominator. And we've done, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we've done nothing to mitigate that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And as you know, our strategic philosophy on proposed rules is to engage actively in the dialogue with the regulators, but more importantly, we really won't look to mitigate until we feel like we have visibility around the final rule. Because we just don't want to mitigate things, and quite frankly do them in error. So we have done nothing to mitigate it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">The reason I highlight the natural tailwind, as I refer to it, is under the Volcker Rule, the $9 billion have to come out of funds. And that is a dollar-for-dollar capital deduction. So just standing still, we would move to 4.7. But we haven't specifically begun to articulate a strategy internally to get us to 5, but this gap is not material for us at this stage to be extremely focused on it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And, then, I guess when you combine the CCAR process and then with some of the other regulations like Volcker, there is obviously some constraint on payouts for everyone. When you think about the other opportunities, so investing in the business, making investments, but on the other hand managing the risk weighted asset side of the equation, are there starting to be more opportunities to invest versus payout? And as the economy improves, does that pick up? Just want to kind of get your sense on the balance there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">That's a great question. I think the one word that you used that, I think should resonate for the whole marketplace, not just Goldman Sachs, is this notion of constraints. And so every firm will be managing to whatever constraint they perceive. Within that really how do you fundamentally manage your capital? And at this particular stage, we're not feeling constrained. Obviously the 11.3%, Basal III ratio I referenced gives you some sense of potential excess capital.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">I think that this, it's an important industry discussion, because obviously for Goldman Sachs, but again the broader industry, the first priority is always about safety and soundness and adequate capital. But I do think that the flip side is there is a risk to excess capital in the system.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And what we're doing is no different than we would have done in the past, if there is periods where we're running with excess capital, we're going to be patient and disciplined and wait for opportunities. And certainly we're in a position today where from a liquidity and capital perspective if there is demand from our clients, we can meet them.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And then last one. Just on the fixed side of the business, you comment a lot on the quarter-over-quarter. When we look at year-over-year, and you have given that, at least on the OTC side you've gotten your clearing kind of in place and you were starting on the electronic side or the self-side. Just wanted to get your sense, I know it's difficult to piece those changes versus the broad environment given a lot of the volatility and the uncertainty out there. But maybe just from client conversations, how that's progressing and where you see that pan out?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I think if you look back over the past year, I think clearing certainly manage by the marketplace and the regulators extremely well. I know there were lot of concerns going into it, but I think the multistage launch, really I have to give everybody high marks for that. Swap execution facility is now up and running, still relatively new, so a bit early to tell, but at this stage, really no significant impact in the marketplace. And again, we'll watch it evolve and its impact with market structure, but really nothing to discern at this stage of any materiality.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Can you talk more about the non-comp expense? I know that's been a focus of your, and it certainly came down a lot, how sticky is that decline?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So at this stage, Mike, as you know, several years ago, we launched the cost reduction initiatives. And so that was a series of steps, which brought us up to just under $2 billion. At this stage we're still being at the margin, very focused on costs throughout the entire system. And so the sequential decline, as you know was obviously litigation. So that's not the mover, but the focus really is about again keeping cost significantly subdued during this part of the cycle, and again at the same time positioning us for an upturn.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So are you still looking to have these non-comp expenses decline down year-over-year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yes. As I said, at the margin, we're very focused on expenses in this part of the cycle and in areas where we can get positive results, you should see them.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">A separate question, the 2% buybacks were nice, perhaps you could do even more. And the threshold for the SLR is $700 billion in assets. And I guess you're above $900 billion. But is there any scenario where you would say, let's reduce our assets to below $700 billion, so there is less regulatory burden on the firm?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">No. There's no plans strategically to shift the size of the balance sheet in any way to get underneath some regulatory threshold. However, there is tactical things we can certainly do with the balance sheet, which I mentioned in my prepared remarks, which gives us some flexibility. And I think, for example, for any market participant if balance sheet becomes a constraint, I think there are elements of the balance sheet that either can be repriced as we move through the cycle or can certainly get smaller.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I've asked this question on several calls, but do you have any published financial targets as of right now?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yes, Mike, and I always appreciate your focus on this. There is no targeted ROE. And as I said earlier, at this stage, what we're really doing is strategically finding the balance point with this part of the cycle to make sure that we position the firm for growth, we provide you, the shareholders, with adequate and hopefully superior relative returns. And in the future, we're going to look to take advantage of all the market opportunities as the cycle improves.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Well, as a key, should I be looking at the proxy? I'm looking at Page 38 of the proxy, and you have the long-term incentive plan and that's based on ROE and growth in book value per share. So should I take that as an indication of what you're most focused on? But then on Page 33, I guess the Compensation Committee reviews results of Goldman versus peers, and it's a laundry list of ROE, EPS, earnings, revenues, comp ratio, non-comp expenses, a couple of other items. So what are you most focused on, if I'm looking at financial metrics?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So any day of the week, as a firm, we're most focused on serving our clients and growing our activity levels. In terms of aggregate financial metrics, all the things that you'll see in the proxy, whether its book value per share, ROE, those are all components into the compensation methodology, as are those other things that are mentioned in the proxy, whether it's our focus on expenses and aggregate performance, but those are part of our long-term incentive plan. I wouldn't view those as specific metrics as it relates to how we think about our capital.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Lastly, at what point do you think you have enough clarity to be able to give us financial targets?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I think, Mike, that we'll continue to communicate our message in a way that we think is appropriate for the context. Right now, obviously, there's still a significant amount of runway in finalization of rules. And as we get more clarity, we will continue to communicate with you how we think about capital. But I'm not sure necessarily having a published target is necessarily the best way to think about how we're managing the franchise, but we'll continue the dialogue, I'm sure.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">A couple of ticky-tacky questions. One is on the I&amp;L revenue line. I was just wondering if you can give a little more color around how much was driven from the monetization of the investments. And you're basically looking to understand how that contributed to the higher incentive fees in the investment management?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So the equity line was driven by a portion of the portfolio, which as I referred to as divestitures and IPOs. And the deadline is really investment-related gains and interest income. And obviously to some extent, you'll see it in the broader market this is a solid harvesting environment. And so you're seeing us do that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And did it have any implication for the incentive fees in investment management or not?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">As I said, the incentive fees this quarter, obviously largely influenced by a single asset that was sold. Again, I would put them more in the bucket of it's a harvesting environment. And so if we have performance, you're going to continue to see incentive fees.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And then the $8.5 billion that you're going to be managing down over time, I mean your clients went into these funds with an expectation of typically 10-ish years or so. But you're not beholding to that timeframe if obviously there's opportunities to extract value early?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So a number of these are older vintage funds. Obviously, we had some visibility on the Volcker Rule, when it was first launched. And so we have obligations to our clients. But again, we'll work with the regulators and continue to harvest the funds in the profile that I gave you. The clients obviously value these returns.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And then just on the Basel III, the transitional numbers we got. I'm just wondering if you can you give us a sense of what your fully phased-in number is, since that's what we've been looking at for a while?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">9.7 on the fully phased-in. But I would remind you again that we have to have the capital coming out of the Volcker funds. And so the transitional measure is maybe the best indicator.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And then that 9.7 is standardized or advanced?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">9.7 was advanced, I thought that that you're asking about, and standardized is 9.3.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And then just lastly on the SLR. You walked through how the Volcker is going to be benefited? Can you give us a sense of how the CCAR would benefit as well?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I think around Goldman Sachs, now we refer to that as CCAR by the way, but I'm not sure that's in the marketplace yet. So we've looked and if we've studied it at the margin, it could in the neighborhood of 10 or 15 basis points. But we're still digging through the details of that. But it's a tailwind too.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So it just a follow-up on the last question. So you gave us fully-phased. The 4.2 on SLR, that's a transitional, is that correct?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">No. That would be a fully phased-in, if you will.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And the increase to 4.7 would just be completely static if you were out of the $9 billion or sold funds today without any other change?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes. We stand still. We do nothing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And then you'd to add that 10 to 15 bps for the CCAR potentially just on top of that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Look again, early days on the CCAR -- and by the way, I'm glad you've adopted the CCAR acronym already. The early days, I think studying the CCAR, so that's why I didn't mention it earlier. But obviously I'm happy to give you a range on it. But the $9 billion that comes out, that comes out. CCAR is obviously a tailwind too.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I just wanted to make sure that we sort of put them all in one place and then it was clear that they're all in the same basis?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">That's correct. And that would give you 4.8 or 4.85, if you will.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Moving back to FICC, I know you don't usually disaggregate, but it would be helpful maybe this time around, because we've seen such diversity of results among some of the different players. If you could give us some color on a year-over-year basis on the divergence that you saw between macro businesses like rates and FX versus credit and commodities, and the more numbers you can help us with, the better?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I think the takeaway from the FICC business this quarter is really given them the market backdrop we had, where sentiment was really fluctuating. We had concerns about Asia growth and then political events. I think it really reinforces that if you're going to be in these businesses, you really need the diversification.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And so as we mentioned, the quarter was helped by commodities, because we have a strong commodities business and you saw in certain segments, really unusually strong volatility. So we had opportunities to work with our clients. We just don't look at it on a quarter-to-quarter basis. We look at in a multi-quarter basis. And in this particular quarter, you saw us outperform.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And just a follow-up question on the commodities. Was that mostly within the energy complex, where you saw the greatest strength?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So that's where the primary volatility was.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">You flagged in the release, the investment banking pipeline, the backlog was down, which is a first time I remember as anyone doing that in a long time. And I'm curious, is that just because of the underwriting calendar or do you sense that M&amp;A is also kind of out of peak and backing off?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">No, it was down. That shouldn't be a surprise. You may remember, Chris, that backlog had hit a post-crises high in the third quarter, then it hit another post-crises high in the fourth quarter. And obviously, the fourth quarter tends to be more of the build quarter and then coming-off of relatively strong quarter, and it wasn't down significantly towards yearend.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I think more importantly, I've made two observations. One that's specific about the backlog, which I mentioned is up significantly versus the first quarter of last year. But I think the takeaway on M&amp;A is an important one. We've now seen a couple of quarters with higher M&amp;A notional volumes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And so these things can all change quite quickly, but right now it does feel like it's an environment where we're far enough away from the epicenter of the crisis, where CEO competence is at a point where strategic transactions are occurring and there is an important takeaway about the nature of the transaction, which is some of them are very large.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And when you have a large transaction environment, I referred to the 31 transactions we did in excess of $1 billion a quarter. Large transactions can have, they won't always, but they can have a catalytic effect, either on the industry or they create subsequent transactions themselves. So again, it could all change on a dime. But right now this trajectory for merger activity feels pretty good. And obviously, over time that feeds a lot of other activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I guess, that's what I was getting at. Everybody is looking for an M&amp;A cycle. And in your view, it's alive and well and that's not the reason for the decline in the backlog?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">No. The level of engagement and conversation is quite good. And then again, look, again I referred to my crystal ball earlier not being great, but right now it feels pretty good.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And then switching gears, the easiest line of your income statement to predict a last couple of years has been the investment management business, because the AUM was always $850 billion and there was always a $1 billion base management fees, I think going all the way back to 2008. And all of a sudden, we're seeing a significant amount of inflows and AUM are up nicely two quarters in a row, what's happening there? And what should we expect? And what's different?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">We've articulated this in the past. Obviously, this has been a strategic growth area for us. And it really has been about, it's a bit old fashion, but it's been focused on performance, delivering for our clients and having differentiated performance. And when you look at our historical multiyear numbers, it looked like strong. And so you're really starting to see the inflows.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Nothing beyond that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Because there has been some small bolt-on acquisitions, which were disclosed, but this is really the core drivers' performance, particularly in fixed income this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Steven Chubak - Nomura</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So Harvey, you made a very interesting point regarding the SLR tailwind from the sale of Volcker assets. Looking at the metrics and where they stand today, assuming that SLR will remain binding, the elimination of the disallowed assets will provide a meaningful boost to the numerator, which will help both your risk and SLR ratios.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">However, the capital relief from any additional shrinkage in I&amp;L, I presume it will impact the denominator exclusively, which if SLR is binding actually incentivizes as you're engaging more risk intensive activities. So should we expect that you'll boost your permissible I&amp;L investments as you optimize the ROE opportunity that you currently see based on the capital constrains as they stand today?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I think we should be really clear on this. In no way shape or form are we going to let the regulatory guidelines or ratios or constraints encourage us to change our risk taking philosophy or how we deploy our capital. I can't underscore that more strongly. We often make mistakes and we're far from perfect, but as a firm, our risk culture focused on mark-to-market and our philosophy has served us well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And we're certainly, as I said, not going to be influenced by metrics that would maybe encourage risk taking. Quite frankly, we would always rather deploy this capital into our franchise businesses and we'll do that as opportunities present themselves.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Steven Chubak - Nomura</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And just one more from me. The Fed in ANPR published earlier this year, suggested that it would consider imposing some tougher restrictions on merchant banking activities, whether via more punitive capital requirements, restrictions on holding periods, what have you. I recognize this is really in the very early stages, but can you help us think about how your business or the merchant banking operation could adapt if tougher restrictions are imposed? And what level of I&amp;L assets would be classified as merchant banking x those, which are disallowed under Volcker? Really just trying to identify what could potentially be exposed?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">It's very early in that process. And so I have no discrete insights for you. We'll obviously participate and have participated in the Federal Reserve's AMPR and it will be an evolving process. Again, I think the fundamental takeaway for you to consider and the way we approach these things, is if needed, if you had outcome that restricted our abilities, we would weigh that outcome and our ability to drive value for that capital. And if we felt, we couldn't drive value for that capital, then we would look to return it to the shareholders. I think it's that simple.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">You've seen it too before in things like our insurance business in Europe and our reinsurance business in United States, and that's the length that will evaluate all of our capital opportunities. But, obviously, we'll discuss this as we get more clarity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Coming back to the commodities, solid results for this quarter, certainly encouraging. Maybe can you talk about your commitment to the physical side of the business and whether or not you think that a regulatory surcharge on that business could make it still economically viable for you all?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">It all depends, obviously, on the outcome. We don't have any visibility into the outcome. But again, it will depend on whether or not regulatory constraint is too high bar. I think more importantly today, as you know, we have a long history in the commodity business, providing our clients corporate treasurers and asset managers around the globe with hedging solutions and access to the marketplace and liquidity, not unlike we do in the corporate bond market.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And separately, we feel we provide value in providing debt and equity capital to the investing side of the business. But it will evolve over time and we'll adjust accordingly. But it's a bit of a wait and see.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Have you seen any impact in that market as some high profile editors have announced plans to exit or sell or what have you?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">This is an important business to us, because it's important to our clients. I don't want to read through too much of this, because it's only one quarter and I think it's hard to extrapolate anything from a quarter. But certainly in commodities this quarter, in certain sectors, the feedback we're getting from clients is that, there may be, and again I have very limited visibility into our competitors businesses, but there just maybe some benefit to those market participants that stay strong in commodities like us, by those that are deemphasizing or exiting, particularly when the market is volatile.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Can you speak to trends of MD and partner headcount over the last few years maybe across the firm and by division?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Obviously, as I mentioned earlier, we've been very focused on cost. We continue to drive efficiencies throughout the organization, in terms of non-comp expenses and obviously also in people. But I don't really have any specific color for you, in terms of by division, et cetera. Obviously, we're managing those resources in the context of the business activity that the businesses are seeing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I was just trying to get a sense, the shift to a more pyramid structure that you guys have referenced in the past.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">This is a partner year for us. So it's been two years since we made partners. And so obviously, we'll be grinding the entire organization through that process this year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And then the last one, just sort of in reference to this $9 billion that you've chatted, where we discussed a bunch here and the dollar-for-dollar capital hit in I&amp;L. Does your experience this year in sort of [indiscernible], which I certainly recognize as positive, trying to shrink the equity base? But does that make you a bit nervous about potential friction in returning that capital and the possibility of trapped capital for a while here as I&amp;L shrinks?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">It doesn't. This year, again, there was a difference in outcome between our results and the Federal Reserves results. We obviously thought we submitted a severe test and the outcome was more severe. Again, I think this process of giving firm the opportunity to adjust, I think it's a good one and it provides us in the marketplace all the flexibility. So again, I have to believe, again, in my opinion only, so discount it as you will. I have to believe, we'll be able to return excess capital over time for the exact reason that excess capital on a sustained basis for any industry, I don't think is a healthy thing. But again, that's just my opinion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Just two quick ones. You obviously spent some time today talking about the ratio at the holding company. Just curious if you could update us on the SLR ratio at the bank level, if that's materially changed from or materially different from what you were talking about maybe a quarter ago?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So, again, I think what we should just do for the purpose of this conversation is, ignore the last quarter and I'll just focus on the supplementary proposal that's out there, because I think the proposal is probably more relevant for your work. And that number in the bank would be 56.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And are there any other mitigating actions you can take within the bank relative to what you talked about in the holding company?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I haven't focused on it. But obviously, there are lots of things that go into the supplementary leverage ratio. So it's not a primary concern.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And then you mentioned, and I'm sorry, if I missed it, but you mentioned in the equities trading side of things, the particular strength in cash in the first quarter. I guess I'm just curious if you could give us some color in terms of the trends in the equities derivatives and PB businesses?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">You can't really read anything, I don't think into one individual quarter. But I think that this quarter in particular was probably in some respects tougher for our client-base than the headline indices would read just in terms of their ability to drive performance. But again, the equity business, to be a leading player, you really have to be strong in all facets of it, which means the prime brokerage business, you have to have a strong research footprint, you have to be able to drive IPOs and secondaries, and obviously you got to be able to commit capital, that's very important, and obviously you have to have a huge commitment of technology. And so, right now we feel quite good about things.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">But in terms of the client activity levels or risk appetite, it sounded like that was a little bit lower than maybe the headlines would have suggested across your non-cash equities businesses?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So if you look at our commissions and fees line, you can see it's up year-over-year and sequentially. But I would say, again, for certain segments of the client, client-based asset management, in particular for example and some of the headwinds, I think it was a tougher quarter for them. But I haven't studied all the full results. That's what I would expect to see.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And at this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So since there are on more questions, on behalf of the team, I'd like to take a moment to thank all of you for joining the call. Hopefully, I and other members of senior management will see you in the coming months. If there are any additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to Dane or the team. And otherwise, please enjoy the rest of your day. Look forward to talking to you soon. Take care.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining today's Goldman Sachs first quarter 2014 earnings conference call.

My name is Dennis and I'll be your conference facilitator today. I'd like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today, April 16, 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you. Mr. Holmes, you may begin your conference.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Dane Holmes</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. Today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the Firm's belief regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain and outside of the Firm's control. The Firm's actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the Firm's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our current annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 2014. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, Global Core Liquid Assets, and supplementary leverage ratio, and you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that's posted on the Investor Relations portion of our web site at www.gs.com. This audiocast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Our Chief Financial Officer, Harvey Schwartz, will now review the Firm's results. Harvey?</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thanks Dane and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I will walk you through the first quarter results, and I am happy to answer any questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Net revenues were $10.6 billion; net earnings $2.8 billion; earnings per diluted share, were $5.94, and our annualized return on common equity was 14.7%. The first quarter was dominated by one primary theme, central bank policies. In the United States, the market heavily debated whether 2015 would be the year that the Federal Reserve raises rates. On the other hand, the European Central Bank announced the creation of a \u20ac1.1 trillion quantitative easing program that kicked off in March.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">The prospect of two of the world's largest economies, implementing divergent monetary policies had a significant impact. Market participants reassess the implications for both global economic growth, and as a consequence, the performance of various financial assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Regarding the economic outlook, on one hand, low rates are viewed as providing an important economic stimulus to the United States. On the other hand, a return to normalized rates would be consistent with a strong underlying economy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Looking at the bigger picture, the degree of conviction around a slow but stable U.S. recovery continued to gain support for most of the quarter. The weaker recent jobs report in the U.S. has sparked some debate around the timing and magnitude of potential rate hikes. However, the long term expectation of slow, but steady growth and higher rates, remains intact.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Across the Atlantic, the announcement of quantitative easing in Europe provided some stability and the basis for greater economic growth in the region. The launch of a \u20ac60 billion per month purchasing program provided greater confidence to market participants on the Eurozone outlook. The impact was immediately felt across European financial markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">If you take the European government bond market for example, more than a quarter of the bonds are trading with negative yields today. The equity markets in Europe rallied, as demonstrated by the 18% increase in the Euro Stoxx 50 Index during the quarter, and the Euro reached its lowest level versus the dollar in 12 years. As a result, there was greater activity as clients responded to heightened market volatility.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Given the scope, complexity and significance of these two different monetary policies, it isn't surprising, that there continues to be a robust discussion around the potential impacts.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">For our firm, the focus continues to be our clients and serving their needs. Our clients are placing a greater premium on both intellectual and financial capital, given market dynamics and an evolving competitive landscape. We are committed to providing our clients with superior advice, investment performance, content, market liquidity, and certainty of execution. We believe that our extensive capabilities favorably position us to meet a variety of client needs, in what is certainly a dynamic market environment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Now I will discuss each of our businesses. Investment Banking produced first quarter revenues of $1.9 billion, up 32% from the fourth quarter. Our Investment Banking backlog decreased since the end of the year, but its still up significantly, relative to a year ago.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Breaking down the components of Investment Banking in the first quarter, advisory revenues were $961 million, the highest since 2007. This 39% increase relative to the fourth quarter reflects both the increase in completed M&amp;A, and the strength of our leading global franchise. In the quarter, Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced and completed M&amp;A. We advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the first quarter, including Allergan's $71 billion sale to Activis; RWE's \u20ac5.1 billion sale of RWE-DEA, [indiscernible] Group, and Dai-ichi Life Insurance Company's $5.7 billion acquisition of Protective Life Corporation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We also advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the first quarter; these include, MeadWestvaco's merger with Rock-Tenn for a combined enterprise value of $20 billion; Charter Communications' $10.4 billion acquisition of Bright House Networks; and Dow Chemicals' $5 billion separation of its chlor-alkali and downstream businesses, to Olin Corporation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Moving to Underwriting, revenues were $944 million in the first quarter, up 26% sequentially as equity issuance improved. During the quarter, we ranked first in Global Equity and Equity Related and Common Stock offerings. Equity Underwriting revenues of $533 million rose 56% compared to the fourth quarter, largely due to an increase in secondary offerings. Debt underwriting revenues were essentially unchanged at $411 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">During the first quarter, we actively supported our client's financing needs, leading Santander's \u20ac7.5 billion follow-on equity offering; Chevron's AUD4.7 billion sale of its stake in Caltex Australia; and Berkshire Hathaway's \u20ac3 billion investment grade issuance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our FICC and Equities businesses, net revenues were $5.5 billion in the first quarter, up significantly compared to the fourth quarter. FICC client execution net revenues were $3.1 billion in the first quarter, and included $32 million of DVA losses. Net revenues were up more than 2.5 times sequentially, as client activity increased in a number of our businesses, in response to higher volatility and improved market conditions. Interest rates and currencies were both significantly higher sequentially, as client activity improved amid diverging central bank policies.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Credit increased significantly from a more challenging fourth quarter, as credit spreads generally tighten during the first quarter. Mortgages also rose versus the fourth quarter, although volatility and client activity remained generally low. Given continued trends in the energy markets, commodities improved sequentially, with higher levels of client activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In Equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees and security services, net revenues for the first quarter were $2.3 billion, up 20% sequentially and include $12 million in DVA losses. Equities client execution net revenues increased 50% sequentially to $1.1 billion due to a favorable market-making backdrop with higher levels of client activity, particularly in derivatives. Commissions and fees were $808 million, down 3% relative to the fourth quarter. Security services generated net revenues of $393 million, up 12% sequentially, reflecting higher customer balances.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to Risk; average daily VaR in the first quarter was $81 million, up from $63 million in the fourth quarter. The move up was primarily due to increased market volatility across all categories.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Moving on to our investing and lending activates; collectively, these businesses produced net revenues of $1.7 billion in the first quarter. Following a sale of our investment in Metro International in the fourth quarter, we made a decision that the remaining revenue related to consolidated investments within the other line, was not significant in the context of the I&amp;L segment. As a result, we are now reporting the other I&amp;L revenues within the equity and debt lines.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Equity Securities generated net revenues of $1.2 billion, primarily reflecting strong corporate performance and company-specific events in private equity, as well as net gains in public equities. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $509 million, with roughly $200 million in net interest income and the balance coming from net gains.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In Investment Management, we reported first quarter net revenues of $1.6 billion, essentially unchanged versus the fourth quarter. Management and other fees were down 3% sequentially to $1.2 billion. Assets under supervision remain flat at $1.18 trillion. $7 billion of long term net inflows, driven by fixed income and equity products, and net market appreciation of $6 billion were offset by net outflows of $14 billion in liquidity products.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Moving to performance; across the global platform, 82% of our client mutual fund assets were in funds ranked in the top two quartiles on a three year basis, and 73% in funds ranked in the top two quartiles on a five year basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Now let me turn to expenses; compensation and benefits expense, which include salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as benefits, was accrued at a compensation to net revenues ratio of 42%. This is the lowest first quarter accrual in our public history, and 100 basis points lower than the accrual in the first quarter of 2014. Our lower accrual rate reflects our strong 14% year-over-year net revenue growth and the positive operating leverage embedded in our firm.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">First quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.2 billion, 12% lower than the fourth quarter, and slightly lower than the first quarter of 2014. The fourth quarter included higher charitable contributions and higher impairment charges on consolidated investment entities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Now I'd like to take you through a few key statistics for the first quarter; total staff was approximately 34,400, up 1% from year end 2014. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 27.7%, that is down from a 2014 rate, primarily due to changes in geographic earnings mix. Our global core liquid assets ended $175 billion. Our common equity tier-1 ratio was 11.4% using the standardized approach, it was 12.6% under the advanced approach. Starting this quarter, the lower of these two ratios is our binding regulatory constraints.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 5.3%, 30 basis points above the minimum requirement that begins in 2018. And finally, we repurchased 6.8 million shares of common stock for $1.25 billion in the first quarter. These repurchases reflected the completion of our 2014 capital plan.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As previously announced, the Federal Reserve Board did not object to our revised 2015 capital plan, which includes share repurchases, dividends and other capital actions. In terms of this year's CCAR test, we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.65 per share beginning in the second quarter. As it relates to our share repurchase capacity, one point I want to highlight, is that any potential share repurchases over the next five quarters, will be heavily back-end weighted. As you all know, we do not publicly disclose the approved size of our repurchase capacity. Again, we take this approach for a very specific and practical reason. We don't want our shareholders to view the approved buyback amount as a commitment to return that capital. For us, capital allocation is a dynamic process. If we see opportunities to deploy the capital attractively to support client activity, we want the flexibility to do it, and conversely, if our clients are less active, we will certainly look to return it. our track record on this one, is well established.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Now, before I take your questions, let me offer some closing thoughts. The first quarter has served as a strong start to 2015. The year-over-year increase in net revenues reflects, not only the strength of our franchise, but also our ability to provide high quality advice and certainty of execution for our clients. Our performance this quarter, well just a quarter, reflects numerous efforts over the last several years to adjust our business. We sold several businesses due to regulatory capital implications. We transformed our financial profile, significantly improving our risk based capital. We revamped our capital allocation processes, improving our decision-making and efficiency. We took a hard look at our operating cost, fundamentally changing our expense structure by eliminating costs, reallocating resources, and leveraging technology. We made all these changes, while at the same time, continuing to invest in our global client franchise.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We know that our success in many ways begins and ends with our clients. It\u2019s the trust they place in us and our ability to execute on their behalf that drives our franchise, and we believe that our steady commitment, particularly through these more difficult years, has been critical to creating stronger client relationships. And there is one important thing that we didn't change, our focus on creating shareholder value, our efforts are ultimately a reflection of our commitment to you, our owners. We understand that to create shareholder value, we need to have strong financial footings, be an efficient allocator of capital, and have a world class client franchise. Ultimately, our efforts over the past several years have meant that a 14% increase in year-over-year revenues can contribute to a 40% increase in net earnings, a 48% increase in earnings per share, a 380 basis point improvement in ROE, and finally 9% growth in book value per share over the past year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Thank you again for dialing in, and I am happy to answer your questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p4\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Hey good morning Glenn.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Good morning. Let's start with Investing and Lending, it was pretty darn good. I am curious on the equity side, how much of it was actually realized in asset sales, because it was a pretty active quarter? And then maybe related to that, if you could give the portfolio of breakdown in terms of equity, debt and lending assets?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So, let's just start with the balance sheet; you know that the balance sheet at the end of the quarter for the fourth quarter was $79.5 billion and in terms of debt, that's basically -- north of $50 billion of that is in the debt line. So that's the bulk of the balance sheet. In terms of equity, as you know, we have $4 billion of public equity and $18 billion of private equity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Now, in terms of the performance in the equity line, in terms of the quarter, we don't think of it as much as asset sales, because we make asset sales often, there is a period we are restricted. That's why we are careful to give you the public equity numbers. But basically, when you break it down, give or take 40% of the performance came from those assets that are already public. 40% came from basically company improvements and the balance would come from things like pending IPOs and things like that. That's how I'd break it down for you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">And, what's the disallowed portion or what's the best way to ask how much Goldman still has in the funds that you need to eventually liquidate?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So I think -- I just want to make sure, I am going to rephrase your question to make sure I understand it. I think you're saying that, in terms of -- under regulatory guidelines, under the vocal compliance, that number is approximately $8 billion, and so, a bit of a high class problem, as we have been harvesting, that number has obviously been going up, because there has been good performance. Now remember of course, one of the reasons we were focusing on that with you over the last couple of years is, because the original deadline in that was July of this year. Of course, the regulators have granted an industry-wide extension on that through 2017. So we continue to focus on it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Great. Last one is, on FICC, I mean, the macro products are great, but credit mortgage wasn't, so not exactly hitting on all cylinders as a whole. But it certainly seems like, maybe some of the reduced capacity in the industry is helping you, and so your long term strategy that we all beat you up for the last five years might be working. Could you talk towards what you're seeing in terms of capacity and now that you've seen a pickup involved, clearly [ph], what it means?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So on FICC, I think you're right to say that, one of the things we have benefited from, certainly is the diversity of the businesses. Its not just FICC, its across equities as well, because as you said, even in a quarter like this, where you're seeing improved FICC performance sequentially and year-over-year, you're really seeing it in the macro side of the business, and as you said, not all cylinders are firing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">In terms of us, through this part of the cycle, while you were beating us up, we were spending a lot of time focused on the clients and staying very-very committed to the businesses, and we are seeing it translate through. I don't have perfect visibility into our competitor's obviously, but you've seen the announcements, some things more stark like commodities. But certainly, we are hearing it from clients, and now we are starting to see a bit of it, I would say geographically, certainly in Europe. I know you asked about FICC, maybe take the equity business for example. We have seen a trend in derivatives, and then certainly in a quarter like this, it was pretty significant.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Okay. Thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Thanks so much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Your next question comes from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Good morning Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Hey, good morning Christian.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So to start on maybe CCAR, the Firm has proven very adaptable in managing the regulatory environment. As you think about, obviously, your CCAR results. I am just curious as to what levers you have here to improve your relative positioning?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Sorry, I didn't hear the very beginning of your question, I apologize Christian. Could you just repeat it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Yeah. So my question basically is just on your CCAR ratios. I am just curious, what levers you have to improve your positioning?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Right. Okay, I understand. So as you know, we get very little transparency by design, in terms of how the regulators have constructed CCAR going into the test. One thing of course is, we get transparency on our results coming out of the test. And so last year, you saw us digest that information among other regulatory constraints, and we took very immediate action around the balance sheet, and as you saw in the second quarter, reduced the balance sheet by $50 billion. Every year's test, you learn a little bit more in terms of the results. This year's tests, in terms of the constraints, again this is all public, had to deal with total capital, and so we are again digesting the results, and we will look at that, in terms of how we think about deploying our balance sheet, our capacity and our capital structure, and again, we will go through a process. I am not saying the process will yield the same results in terms of last year's balance sheet actions, but we are going through that same diagnostic process now, with our teams in the businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay. Have you mentioned your clients are placing a greater premium on kind of financial capital, and [indiscernible] execution. Curious to how this is being expressed? Are you seeing a wider bid-ask spreads in the market that give you more business, or something else?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So, as I mentioned, we are seeing it in certain parts. I guess one of the areas I point to, is if you just look at the capital we committed to block transactions during the course of the quarter, obviously there were some significant capital commitments we made to clients during the course of the quarter, the largest block transactions that were done. And so, we felt very well positioned to connect those sellers or issuers of equity, with buyers on the other side.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">I'd say more broadly, the process of repricing has been maybe slower than folks would have expected. We are certainly seeing it in parts of the business, and when you start to see it, is when the market picks up. So again, I highlight the derivatives activity, which was a solid driver in our equities client execution line this quarter. We have also talked about it in commodities for example. So in the comm markets, you don't see it as much. But when activity picks up, you start to see it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Great, very helpful. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Good morning, Matt.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Any more color you can give us in terms of the strengths within equity, derivatives, from a regional point of view, should we assume that it was in Europe, from QE and some of the movement in prices there. Just trying to piece that line item together a little bit more?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Yeah so, within equities, the performance was really broad based in what we saw this quarter. We talked for a long time with you about -- to really be a significant player in this, you need to have scale and you need to -- for example, be in all the business lines, whether its prime brokerage, derivatives, ability to commit capital which I just spoke about, you need to have strong electronic capabilities, and you need to be geographically diverse. And this was a quarter, where we really saw strong contribution across the entire business, and I highlight derivatives in Europe, because it was a driver, and we hadn't seen it recently, but that's really a sum of it, but was really broad-based, and it really leaned into the strength of our business. And again also of course, we had a weaker Q1 last year. But it was a solid performance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. And then just separately, in terms of the comp-to-revenue ratio coming down, I mean I feel like symbolically its important that the ratio came down the first quarter, which hasn't for several years. So just how are you thinking about, what the target is, in terms of operating leverage? You said, a focus on generating positive operating leverage, but I think it was more than two times to one, so you had a lot of margin there to say, play with?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So, the 42% at this stage is our best estimate. We did reduce the competition expense last year from 44% to 43%, and then this is 42%. And again, we have always talked about the fact that, the compensation is going to be driven by performance, and this year with the 14% year-over-year increase in revenues, that's our best estimate.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Now in terms of the operating leverage, this has been years of hard work, in terms of managing expenses, really thinking about how to most efficiently use the resources. And so, when you have that in place and you get the revenue uptick, obviously, its much -- you can more easily translate that into the bottom line, and that's what you're seeing this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. Thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Good morning Harvey. Just a follow-up on the equity [indiscernible]. So it sounds like you mentioned the derivatives, you mentioned blocks; I just wanted to make sure on the block side, was there anything that was way outside, when you look at whether its maybe quarter-over-quarter, because year-over-year, you know, you had a weak comp?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">No. As I said, prime brokerage balances were up. There were a number of drivers in volume and activity. But it was really client driven. So there were index rebalance, transactions that we do. This quarter, we were able to facilitate large volumes for clients. It just came together nicely.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. And then -- I think it was the last quarter, but you guys gave some of the repositioning that has taken place in the past couple of years, the revenues that were lost. Then you guys have also mentioned, a lot of the investment that you are making on the technology side, to position for a lot of these new roles. When you think about, what is expected of the industry, at this point going forward, do you feel like most of that is in place, and I guess what I am trying to get at is, if you are already positioned for that, then from the client or the market share standpoint, maybe that's one of the things that's driving it, as a lot of other firms are still trying to figure things out. So wanted to get a sense of, where you guys think you're, given all these conflicting regulations, and how well you can manage them, at this point, given what you know?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So, let me start with technology, because obviously technology has been a critical driver and part of our operating infrastructures are firm for as long as you have been covering us and well before. And that investment is not something obviously you can do in a short period of time. So this reflects decades of investment in technology platform as you know. We have talked about this in the past, Mike, we have one risk management platform SecDB, which certainly gives us some efficiencies in scale, because as we adapt, if we need to build things for our equity business, or if we need to build things in different parts of the world, it obviously goes without saying, that you can be more efficient as you replicate those things.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So its that constant reinvesting in the business that gives us that flexibility, but that's not new. The regulatory component obviously, as we get into the finalization of rules and the implementation of rules, that will continue to be an ongoing process; when we think about technology away from the narrow subset of regulatory compliance, which plays obviously a mentally critical role. The other way we think about it is, really how do we deliver to clients, and that again, we continue to invest in, and then other than being efficient, are there ways we can grow revenues from technology, and so we are constantly monitoring that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay, that's helpful. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thanks Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hi. I am just going to ask a real basic question; how sustainable were your results in each of the four business lines? You already said, the investment banking backlog is a little bit less than at year-end. So as you look at it compared to the prior quarter, should we expect this higher level of performance, or is this just the usual first quarter bump and that we are going back down to a lower level?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So lets just take Investment Banking, Mike; so you remember, at the end of last year, we talked about the fact that we had 1 trillion announced transactions and there was a $200 billion gap between us and our next closest competitor. So in the first quarter obviously, you would expect to see a certain of those transactions coming through. I would point out that the backlog is up significantly from last year. And so, in terms of the backlog in the quarter, it was down a little bit in investment banking, and then it was up across equity underwriting and it was up across debt underwriting.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">[Indiscernible] about the backlog, in the way that you described it, but for example, if you asked the question slightly differently, you said listen, the trend in banking, does it feel like its still in place? The short answer to that is yes; when we talk to CEOs and Boards, CEO and Board confidence continues to be high, and you've even seen in the last couple of weeks in announced transactions, there is a fair bit of activity out there, and we feel very well placed for it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And on the trading side?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So, on the trading side I'd say the same thing; in terms of trends, this discussion around diverging monetary policies, which is a catalyst. That trend feels like its in place, and the client dialog and in terms of our communication, we are very focused. But in terms of you extrapolating that in terms of the quarter, its very early in the quarter, and so all these things, as you know, are going to be driven by the environment, and ultimately, how our clients respond to that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Then one follow-up question; the PSUs are new with an 11% hurdle for ROE and this quarter you had a 14.7% ROE. So is that PSU hurdle high enough, how did you come to that? Do you consider that kind of a target for the firm?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I am glad you asked that question; because we have had this discussion around target. And as we said before, a call wouldn't be complete, unless we talked about something about a target with you Mike. So really important, the PSUs that you mentioned, which I am sure you saw in the proxy, that is not a target for the firm; and that's an important distinction for everyone to understand. The reason we don't have a published ROE target, is because it's just not how we manage the firm. If you recall, all the time we spent in the fourth quarter, talking about our ROE framework, in terms of how we think about capital management. That's a much better way to understand how the firm thinks about most efficiently deploying its capital.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So in terms of the PSUs, as for the proxy, our Board engaged with shareholders actively as they always do, and they took that feedback in along with other constituents, and they felt like adding those metrics to certain executives in the firm, made sense from a shareholder perspective.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">All right thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">The other thing Mike I'd say on ROE target, its interesting you know; if we'd had an ROE target out there, and again, because you and I have gone through this so many times. If we'd had a target out there, we had an 11.2% return last year. If we had a target out there of 13%, and we had our 14.7%, I don't know how you would digest that. We really view 14.7%, it\u2019s a good solid performance for the quarter, its close -- we are really in mid-teens territory now. But our aspirations to deliver for our shareholders are higher. And so -- again, that's why we don't have a specific target. We really think about how to drive value over the long run.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">All right. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thanks Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Hey, thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Hey Betsy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Hey good morning. Hey, a couple of questions. One is just on the fundamental review, the trading that Basel is currently engaged in and wanted to get your thoughts on, how you see that going, and if it goes into places its currently outlined, how you deal with that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So we have obviously been actively involved with the regulators, as does the industry broadly on the trading book review. I think its too early to extrapolate anything from the QIS in terms of any final rule. Our discussion, we think its important -- its really about calibration in terms of how folks want to actually think about the next round of a rule set. But as you have seen us do in the past, whenever we get a final rule, we will work within that rule set. I think that -- as we think about these rules that impact businesses where we require to have inventory, again we got to think about calibration, because we need to think about market liquidity and the industry's ability to provide that, so that has been a discussion for us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Right. Just because it feels like the hedging is a little bit clunky, not really treating risk as you would want to manage it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yeah I would say, let's give regulators time on this, I don't want to pre-judge anything. There is still a lot of work to do.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. And then just separately, maybe speak a little bit to how you're thinking about the commodities business? We have had some recent headlines from some of the regulators on that. I know that you're very committed to a client oriented business. But could you just identify how much of -- what your commodities business generates today is client facing?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So the driver -- I mean, our commodity is all about the clients. As you know, we have sold certain assets, and that's really the driver and when we talk about commodities within our fixed income business, that's what it is. I think -- look, its an interesting time to be having this discussion around commodities and regulation, because as we have seen really since the first quarter of last year, we start to see volatile natural gas markets, then followed by this huge decline in the energy markets over the last six plus months.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I think it really reinforces the needs for firms like Goldman Sachs to be in a position to provide our clients with liquidity, with financing capacity, and so for us, as you know, we have been in the commodity business forever. We know how valuable it is to our clients, we are hugely committed to it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">In terms of regulation, we will see how the regulation evolves, and again, we will stay in active dialog with the regulators. But I think at this stage, everybody sees how critical it is, and how important it is to clients. That's what I would say.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Good morning Harvey. Question for you first of all on the buyback comment you made and the idea of backend loading, and I was wondering in the context over the last couple of years, where it has tended to be more consistent. What prompted the rethink? Is it something to do with CCAR, reinvestment opportunities that you're seeing? Just a little color on that would be helpful?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">As you know, year-to-year, the CCAR test changes. Obviously I can't speak to anything at supervisory level detail. But there were aspects and nuances of this year's tests, that to the extent to which we use our capacity, that we would use our capacity later in the year. Now this is public of course, the Federal Reserve gives you capacity on a quarter-by-quarter basis. And so, I was just letting you know, that due to nuances in this year's test, largely driven by the fact that we are mark-to-market firm -- we mark-to-market our balance sheet, that the -- to the extent to which we use it, it will be more back-end weighted.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. So it has more to do with that, than the idea that with business levels picking up, you're seeing more opportunities to deploy capital in the business?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">No. I was specifically speaking in a CCAR context, with the expected capacity. Of course, as you know when you look at our long history, as a firm, for the vast majority of our history, we have reinvested capital into the business, and so to the extent to which we continue to see growth in client demand, obviously that's our preference.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Got it. Let me ask you a litigation question; you certified a $190 million in the quarter, can you give us a sense for how much of that is the reserve build versus just incurred costs?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So we don't break it down specifically at that level. What I will tell you, it\u2019s the same process. We continue to evaluate any outstanding litigation in the course of the quarter, and we accrue accordingly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And how should we think about, the fact that in the most recent quarter, one of your major competitors said that they were in negotiations with the Department of Justice on private label mortgage securitizations. And really at this point, if we assume that they do what they are in negotiations to do. The only major U.S. dealer that wanted to have done one of those settlements is Goldman. Should we be thinking that there is probably going to be something coming down the line in the next few quarters, that you're in negotiations?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So again, to the extent to which on any specific cases, we are not going to comment. I am sure you understand that. I would really encourage you to look at the most recent 10-K and our Q disclosure, where we are very explicit about all these matters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay, fair enough. And then, the final question I had for you is just on the tax rate. You talked about geography and obviously, we have seen tax rates similar to -- that you had this quarter in the past. Would it be appropriate for us to sort of factor that in together with the norm for the first quarter together, with the normal kind of low 30s and be thinking in terms of something along the lines of 30% for the full year, or would you expect this tax rate to continue?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So it\u2019s a good question. So just for everyone who may have not had a chance to be [indiscernible] beginning of the call, effective tax rate for last year was 31.4 and for the quarter was 27.7, and as you have pointed out Guy, that was mostly driven by geographic earnings mix.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">What I would say is, all factors being equal, in terms of the full year rate, and the way you should think about it, given that we are starting from such a low level, I think its reasonable to assume that we come in below last year's rate. But we will see how the year evolves.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. That's really helpful. Thank you, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Sure, thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Hey good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Hey Jim.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Just maybe circling back to FICC. FX [0:41:31] rates are very strong, which you obviously highlighted as did everybody else, credit, mortgages being weak year-over-year, but we had an environment where, I mean, I guess that if you look at sort of trace volumes being up, credit spreads were pretty stable. What's really, I guess, hurting that business, is it just simply, there wasn't enough volatility, or just absolute low rates are hurting spreads, or is it -- clearly inventory levels are down, or is it a combination of all those things. Just trying to think what is a better environment do we just need to see higher rates?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I think this last quarter was really a case of investors evaluating, clients really evaluating, where they used to be, with respect to their portfolios. There was obviously less refinancing activity during this quarter versus a year ago. But I would say the key driver is the debate overrates and how people are thinking about their portfolios. I think if we saw a path towards normalized rates over time, I think you could see a pick-up.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. So we just kind of need to wait and see rates get a little -- more conviction about rates and predictability. And just maybe a bigger picture question on the banking cycle and M&amp;A. Clearly, we have seen a nice pickup and continued in the first quarter, where do you -- in terms of conversations with clients, do you still think there is a lot of juice left in, I think if you look at past cycle, this would imply we still have quite a bit of room to go. Just want to hear your thoughts on it, if you --</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">You're right. In terms of -- if you want to use the benchmark path cycles, certainly there is room for increased M&amp;A activity. In terms of our discussions with CEOs and Boards, I would say that the momentum feels still quite good. There is large transactions within industries tend to be a catalyst for other transactions. Strategies are very well positioned, in terms of driving synergies, the financing markets remain attractive. Again -- so, there is room here, and our recent dialog is quite good, and as you point out, there is room versus sort of historical benchmarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay, great. That's helpful. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Chris Kotowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Hi. Good morning. Just wanted to circle back to the equity client execution, because the result is just so discontinuous with -- though its roughly double the last, say, eight quarter moving average. I mean, can you say -- was it just a unique opportunity set, was it a couple of big transactions, was it related to the block transactions that you were talking about earlier, or is this more like the new normal?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Look, we will see how the subsequent quarter goes. I would say that, look, if we looked at last year's first quarter, it was definitely a more challenging market-making environment. Again, this is really just one where, geographically, from a derivatives perspective, the ability to commit capital. Things just really lined up quite nicely for our franchise; and again, it was broad based. So the environment was good everywhere. Doesn't mean it can't get better and doesn't mean it can't decline, but it was good everywhere this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Chris Kotowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. And then on a kind of a global macro-view back in 2011, I guess the prospect of a Greek default inside the Eurozone and crisis and we seem closer to it than ever. Is it now in your view, a non-event, if and when it happens, that everyone has had enough time and preparation to get ready for it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">It\u2019s a complicated question. I would say, first of all Greece has been in view for a long time for folks, so people have had an opportunity to digest it. I think that, on the plus side, the environment in Europe versus 2011 is dramatically different, in terms of -- if you think about the discussion around other peripheral countries relative to 2011. And so I think, those are all things on the plus side. We are obviously monitoring it very carefully.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I would say, on the concerning side, look, its an experiment that hasn't been run, and so we will have to see what it has for markets. But its certainly, if we compare this to 2011, you'd have to assume that, the risk is much more contained, given people have had years to focus on this.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Chris Kotowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Good morning Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Hey Brennan.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So quick one on thinking about equities here coming into 2Q, typically strong, given dividend season in Europe. How much do you think that QE on the continent is going to play into that this quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Well clearly, it was a big driver in terms of increased confidence in Europe, and you saw that immediately -- that translated immediately into big uptick in European equity markets. We will see how much pull-through that has during the course of the quarter, but clearly it has been in focus for our clients now, and so we will see how much stamina it has. But obviously the commitment to QE is substantial.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Sure. And then, sorry about bringing it back to equities here, but one more; can you just speak to what sort of impact Asia had on the quarter, particularly given some of the market structure changes we saw in the region?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So, certainly it was a contributor, if I ranked it for you, it was -- Europe was a more significant contributor. But the trend in Asia, has been much better, obviously. And as those markets continue to liberalize, I think the dynamic nature of capital flows will continue to increase. Of course, it was helpful in Asia, but again, this was broad-based across our equity business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Longer term, we are pretty optimistic about the opportunities there though.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Terrific. Thanks a lot.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Hey, good morning Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Hey, good morning Steven.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So I just had a question on CCAR and your preferred issuance plans. With total capital under CCAR specifically, now the binding [ph] constraint for the firm. Even though you're already operating at that 150 basis point preferred target, is it fair to expect that you will look to close the gap, or improve your CCAR position by issuing more preferreds or more qualifying debt?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So you may have seen, or you may not have seen, Steven, but we are actually -- we announced this morning, we are out in the market with preferred. So that transaction is out in the market now, and we will be closing later this afternoon. In terms of how we think about this, this is a great question, because as I said before, a lot of this is about how you digest the CCAR results and how you think about -- again things like, how you price the balance sheet, how you deploy your capital and the optimal capital structure. And so, you should assume we are going to look at everything, in terms of how we position the firm going forward as it relates to the capital structure, make sure we do -- we construct it in a way that's most efficient for our clients and most efficient for our shareholders.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">That's really helpful Harvey. And actually, in that same vein, since you mentioned about capital allocations under CCAR, it might be helpful if you could clarify, regarding how you allocate the capital under your attributable equity framework. Under CCAR lines, do you use for your stressed end of [ph] period or your minimum ratio for determining the level of required capital for assessing the adequacy of the ROEs for various trades?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Right. So some of this obviously, we consider proprietary in terms of how we think about the dynamic nature of capital management. But for the folks who haven't studied, and obviously Steven is a very thoughtful consumer of the information. In terms of our return on attributed equity framework, what we have discussed with the marketplace, is basically all those factors that contribute to regulatory capital constraints, Basel-III advanced, standardized, supplementary leverage ratio, elements of CCAR. We had weightings [ph] to those, given their significance and we basically have constructed an algorithm that helps guide us, both in executing certain transactions, and obviously how we evaluate businesses over the long run. But we haven't discussed the specifics of how we incorporate those variables.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. Well that's it for me Harvey, thank you for taking my questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question is from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Good morning Matt.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Good morning Harvey. Just a question for you, in terms of what's going on in the capital markets with your businesses, specifically on the energy side of things. We have heard from a number of more commercially oriented banks so far this earning season about what's going on with their borrowing and capital markets activity within that sector specifically. I am curious given what's happened in the last two to three quarters in the oil markets, have you seen a meaningful increase in those companies coming to market, or has that been much more status quo?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I can't comment specifically in terms of the [indiscernible]. What I will say is, obviously given our role in commodities and our role -- energy companies and industrial companies broadly, the activity level for the past several quarters has been extremely high. Often what you will see is, given sort of this really very steep decline in the oil price, is, those things won't translate immediately. But over time, obviously the industry adjusts that, and then you begin to see things like merger transactions and capital actions. And so, the activity level -- the dialog is quite high, but I can't point you to any specific transactions that I would highlight.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. And then just switching to investment management; you mentioned that there was an outflow on liquidity products. It seemed a little bit larger than what we have seen from a couple of other peers. I guess I am curious if you can just give us a little more color on that, and does -- what happened over the last couple of quarters with the flows, presume a somewhat higher normalized pre-tax margin in that business, relative to the high teens that you typically put up?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So in terms of the flow, as we said, there was $13 billion of combined net inflows and market appreciation, offset by $14 billion in liquidity outflows. Those flows can move around, as clients reallocate assets and move back and forth. I think if you look at the historical movement around those predominantly mutual fund assets, you will see flows like this historically, so I wouldn't point to any meaningful indicator.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">In terms of the margins of the business, obviously this business remains strategically a very high priority for us. We have been investing in it for years, and we continue to see progress; and over time, we expect that you will see margin expansion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. And then just finally for me, was there any material change this quarter versus the fourth quarter in the benefit to your Basel III ratios from a significant financial institution deduction that you said was about $5 billion last quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yeah, that's not the key driver in this quarter. It really is the growth in equity. It\u2019s a [indiscernible] driving it this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. Thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Good morning. Just a quick question on the capital ratios; can you give us what the fully phased-in capital ratios are, what's the RWAs?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Sure. So fully phased-in is 11.8 and 10.6. Now again, we just got a question on the significant clients for institutional deduction, and so when you look at that, that between the transitional, I would say, the best way to think about it on an apples-to-apples basis, assuming all other factors being equal, you should assume that the fully phased-in versus transitional would roughly be around the midpoint of that, because we get the benefit of the significant institutional deduction, as we move money out of funds.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">In terms of RWAs on the quarter, for advanced $565 million, and standardized $626 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. And towards the [indiscernible] 5.3% and the kind of the constraint ratio for CCAR has moved up the total capital. Do you have a sense of what the buffer is that you would run the SLR [ph] at now, could you get away with a 50 basis point buffer, since the total seems to be constraining?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">We haven't finalized a buffer in terms of how we are thinking about that. And so, we will have to see how that evolves, in terms of how we want to think about it. But obviously, there has been significant progress, and we are above the 2018 minimum requirement.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Great. All right, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question is from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Thanks. Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Good morning Eric.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">One of the dominant themes from Goldman last year was the very significant reduction in its balance sheet size. And so I am wondering how -- if we should be thinking about that differently at all, at this stage, given what you're talking about, with respect to client interest and demands, but relative to the capital constraints that were highlighted under the CCAR and I am assuming were the genesis for today's preferred offering. How should we think about all of the dynamics with respect to balance sheet size?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So the balance sheet reduction we went through last year, it\u2019s a great -- I am glad you brought it up. That was about repricing the balance sheet, and all about this framework we talked about, in terms of how we deploy our marginal capital. And so, if you think again about last year's test, you could grow equity, you could grow capital, but the reality is, you obviously -- you want to do that in a way that delivers marginal returns. And so, that was all about repricing, and so as we went through an exercise last year, that was repricing [indiscernible]. If we again -- our preferred operating position would be to grow the capital base, grow the balance sheet accretively and deploy that capital to clients. but obviously, we are going to be very sensitive to returns on that, and how that marginal balance sheet gets priced.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">But it sounds like, from your repricing commentary, you do see that at least on the margin occurring?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Correct. Well we certainly have seen some in terms of pricing, and then last year, we felt the discipline of the process we went through -- went quite well, as we talked about, there was very little disruption to client activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Great. Thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin Ryan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Hey, good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Good morning Devin.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin Ryan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Good morning. Just one the ROE outlook and the drivers, obviously your margin is a big one, and the pretax margin for all of last year is 36%. It was 37% this quarter, which I thought was impressive. So we just look at the businesses, that have more of a granular level, are there are areas where you feel like you're getting to about as good as it will be, and then where do you see the biggest areas for additional leverage to the margin?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So the discussion around how we manage the businesses and where we think about driving additional leverage, that's a continual conversation at Goldman Sachs that's going to happen all the time; because we are always reviewing the businesses, and making sure we are driving them to the ultimate outcome. Now, to the operating leverage you're seeing, that's firm-wide, and really is the result of, again, the years of investment we made in technology, how we scaled the resources, the cost cutting programs that we announced several years ago that was raised, and several billion dollars. And so, you are now just starting to see all that translate through. But we are constantly evaluating the businesses for opportunities, both to grow and to hold.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin Ryan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. Thanks, and then just coming back to Europe one last time, the stability that's helping client activity, is there any way you can just help size that for us relative to the recent past; how much stronger was it this quarter, we talked about derivatives, but where else does that pickup, and any perspective around how much bigger it was this quarter, relative to the recent past?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So I highlighted it to give you some sense of the underpinnings of the activity that's driving it. But again, in equities, it really was broad-based client activity, geographic and across the business and within individual product lines.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin Ryan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thanks Devin.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question is from the line of Kian Abouhossein with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kian Abouhossein</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yes hi. Just coming back to equity derivatives, I was wondering if you could just give a little bit more flavor in terms of products, if the strengths on the execution side came maybe more from the flow side, or was it more from the delta one side or structuring side or dividend swaps; can you just talk a little bit through the products in order for us to get a better understanding of what we should think about going forward trends, in some of these areas? Because clearly, some of them are a bit more bulky than others, if I may?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Really Kian, its truly client activity across each of the businesses. So I wouldn't highlight any particular product line within the derivative businesses. Obviously, when you have a big up move in European equity markets like you did with QE, obviously that's an opportunity for clients to get involved, and there is lots of things they look at, both from a [indiscernible] perspective and a more structured perspective. I think if you try and answer your question around things like where, people are more interested in derivatives that had maybe multi-variables, sure. But again, it was broad-based, it wasn't any one particular driver.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kian Abouhossein</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And there is no real distinction between structuring with this flow, in terms of -- your mix not much significantly changed?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I won't talk to our mix, because the firm obviously, we have the intellectual capital on the systems, and the capacity to point that capital for clients. And so, I think we are always well positioned for those parts of the cycles in the market. But again, broad-based in equities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kian Abouhossein</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yeah. And in respect to fixed income, we have had some things giving us a bit of a steer in terms of how the revenues breakdown between macro and credit, and I was wondering, could you give us a bit of a feeler as well? Is it half-half at this point in the first quarter, or should we think about it differently?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">We don't provide a detail by macro versus credit. What I would say is that -- look, we have an investment in all these businesses, and again, we benefited from the diversity. At times, credits can be particularly active, and at times, macro is going to be particularly active. But we don't provide disclosure in terms of that split.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kian Abouhossein</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And lastly, on commodities. Clearly, commodities had an uptick in volatility, but at the same time, you highlight volatility as a business which year-on-year was down. I am just wondering, if you could just explain a little bit to me, why commodities was relatively weak on a year-on-year basis?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So you may recall that last year, and I was going back to the first quarter 2014, commodities had a very strong quarter, a lot of that is we discussed at the time, was due to the extraordinary volatility of natural gas. And it drove a lot of client activity in the sector, and that was really the first time you and I started talking about the fact, that we were really seeing the absence of competitors on the field, and a huge uptick in client dialog. And so you're just coming off a very strong 2014 first quarter, but commodities remains a very active space for us, and our dialog with clients is quite strong.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kian Abouhossein</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. That explains it. Thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thanks Kian.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Thank you. I want to ask you, one thing that you highlighted in the press release was the largest ever NPL -- largest increase in five years in tangible book value. Would the increase in returns and still continue constraints on capital deployment, isn't that really a fundamental accelerator, as you look forward over the next couple of years?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So again, the environment is going to -- ultimately something that we participate in. But I would say that again, the thing that we have focused on over the last several years, which has been making sure that we continue to invest in our client franchise, and at the same time, build operating leverage. That's why you're seeing that. You're seeing the 14% year-over-year growth in quarterly revenues, and its just translating to the bottom line, with a lot of operating leverage.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And then, when you look at the comp ratio at 42%, once you made some improvement with what you've done in the past, but when you look at it on the average for the year, you have recently highlighted, then on the 38% kind of number. In that, you would look for the year being closer to what you've done in the past couple of years. When you see that you almost have $0.50, $0.60 of earnings per share that's basically pushed forward as you review performance in your compensation plans over the rest of the year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So its our best estimate today, Mosby, and we will evaluate the year as we go through and obviously again, as we have discussed in the past, the culture of pay for performance at Goldman Sachs will evaluate it continuously as we go through, and it will be driven by performance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Thanks Mosby.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Since there are no more questions, I just want to take a moment to thank all of you for joining the call. Hopefully, I will be able to and other members of senior management, we will see many of you in the coming months. If you have any additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to Dane. Otherwise, enjoy the rest of your day, and look forward to speaking with you on our second quarter call. Take care now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs first quarter 2015 earnings conference call.

My name is Dennis, and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">This call is being recorded today, April 19, 2016.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you. Mr. Holmes, you may begin your conference.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Dane E. Holmes - Head-Investor Relations</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm's belief regarding future events that, by their nature are uncertain and outside of the firm's control. The firm's actual results and financial conditions may differ possibly materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm's future results, please see the description of Risk Factors in our current annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, global core liquid assets and supplementary leverage ratio. You should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that's posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">This audiocast is copyrighted material to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Our Chief Financial Officer, Harvey Schwartz, will now review the firm's results. Harvey?</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thanks, Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I'll walk you through the first quarter results and I'm happy to answer any questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Net revenues were $6.3 billion; net earnings, $1.1 billion, and earnings per diluted share, $2.68. Net earnings to common included a $161 million benefit related to the successful tender of our APEX securities. The tender added $0.36 per diluted share.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">The first quarter of 2016 was challenging. It started with renewed uncertainty about the global economic outlook, with the possibility of a recession even being raised. These concerns included growth prospects from China, plummeting oil prices, a strengthening U.S. dollar, and multiple geopolitical events, to name a few. All these came into focus during an eventful first quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">These concerns translated into significant price pressure at the beginning of the quarter across both equity and fixed income markets. The Dow declined by 6% in the first week. This is the worst start in its nearly 90-year history. The index ultimately reached its low point in mid-February, declining 10%. Equity markets in other geographies endured even more material declines during the quarter, with the Shanghai down as much as 25% and the Nikkei down as much as 21%. Credit spreads also widened significantly intra-quarter, particularly for high yield and energy-related issuers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Global Central Bank activity was front and center again during the quarter. After raising rates in December for the first time in more than nine years, the market heavily debated the Federal Reserve's future actions. In the eurozone, the European Central Bank took additional stimulus measures well beyond what was initially expected by the market. And finally, the Bank of Japan moved interest rates into negative territory.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">With all these factors at work, it isn't surprising that it resulted in a difficult operating environment for our clients and, by extension, constrained opportunities in each of our business segments. Within Investment Banking, for example, industry-wide equity underwriting volumes declined by 57% year-over-year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Performance was challenged for many of our ICS clients. For example, nearly 80% of the largest active U.S. equity mutual funds underperformed their benchmarks in the quarter. As you would expect with markets flat-to-down worldwide, our equity investing business was negatively impacted. And finally, incentive fees declined during the quarter due to limited harvesting opportunities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">With that as a backdrop, let's now discuss individual business performance in greater detail. Investment Banking produced first quarter net revenues of $1.5 billion, 5% lower than the fourth quarter as we saw lower client activity across M&amp;A and equity underwriting. Our Investment Banking backlog decreased since the end of the year but is still up relative to a year ago.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Breaking down the components of Investment Banking in the first quarter, Advisory revenues were $771 million. 12% decline relative to the fourth quarter reflects a decrease in the number of completed M&amp;A transactions. Year-to-date, Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced M&amp;A.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the first quarter, including Syngenta's $43.6 billion cash tender offer from ChemChina; Valspar's $11.3 billion acquisition by Sherwin-Williams; and ADT's $12 billion acquisition by Apollo.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We also advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the first quarter, including BG Group's \u00a347 billion acquisition by Royal Dutch Shell; BT Group's\u00a312.5 billion acquisition of EE Limited; and PETCO Animal Supplies' $4.6 billion sale to a consortium of investors.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Moving to Underwriting, net revenues were $692 million in the first quarter, up 4% sequentially as a pickup in debt underwriting more than offset a slowdown in equity issuance. Equity underwriting revenues were $183 million. This was down significantly compared to the fourth quarter due to a decrease in offerings industry-wide. Debt underwriting revenues were up 16% to $509 million and benefited from strong investment-grade issuance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">During the first quarter, we actively supported our clients' financing needs, participating in Newell Rubbermaid's $8 billion financing to support its acquisition of Jarden, Vista's $4 billion loan and bond offering to support its acquisition of Solera, and Devon Energy's $1.5 billion follow-on offering.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our FICC and Equities businesses, net revenues were $3.4 billion in the first quarter, up 20% compared to the fourth quarter. In the quarter, we early-adopted the new accounting standard for DVA, which is now captured in other comprehensive income. DVA for the current quarter was immaterial. FICC Client Execution net revenues were $1.7 billion in the first quarter, up 48% sequentially, as client activity improved in many businesses from weak fourth quarter levels.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">As I mentioned, the operating environment across the FICC complex was quite difficult due to macro uncertainty and volatile markets. This led to a challenging backdrop for our clients with weak investment performance and drove difficult market-making conditions for the firm. The environment in the first quarter of 2016 stands in stark contrast to the environment in the first quarter of last year. Consequently, there was a substantial downward revenue pressure year-over-year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Interest rates and currencies were significantly lower. Client activity and interest rates held up relatively well. However, activity within currencies declined compared to a strong first quarter of last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Credit also decreased significantly as market conditions remained difficult, particularly in Europe. Commodities was weaker as client activity was muted with energy prices remaining low. Mortgages continue to be challenged as spreads widened for some products and client activity remained low.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In Equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees, and security services, net revenues for the first quarter were $1.8 billion, up 1% sequentially. First quarter results in Equities were roughly consistent with the back half of last year but significantly weaker compared to a robust performance in the first quarter of 2015. Net revenues declined 23% year-over-year and reflected the impact of a challenging environment for our clients and the firm.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Equities client execution net revenues of $470 million were down significantly year-over-year. Higher volatility and global equity market weakness at the beginning of the quarter impacted investor conviction and risk appetite.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Commissions and fees were $878 million, up 9% year-over-year as client activity increased in our lower touch electronic channels. Security services generated net revenues of $432 million, up 10% year-over-year on improved spreads.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to risk, average daily VaR in the first quarter was $72 million, up slightly from $71 million in the fourth quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Moving on to our Investing &amp; Lending activities, collectively, these businesses produced net revenues of $87 million in the first quarter. In equity securities, markdowns on public investments entirely offset net revenues in private investments. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $87 million. Revenues were driven by net interest income. This was partially offset by increased provisions on our corporate energy exposures.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In Investment Management, we reported first quarter net revenues of $1.3 billion. This was down 13% from the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of lower incentive fees and management and other fees. During the quarter, management and other fees were down 6% sequentially to $1.2 billion due to a change in the mix of client assets and strategies.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Assets under supervision increased $35 billion sequentially to a record $1.29 trillion, primarily due to net inflows into liquidity and long-term fee-based products. We had $16 billion of net inflows into liquidity products, $10 billion of long-term net inflows, primarily driven by fixed income and equity products, and $9 billion of market appreciation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior-year equity awards and other items such as benefits, declined by 40% versus the first quarter of 2015. The significant reduction in compensation and benefits expense reflects the more challenging revenue environment and translated into a compensation to net revenues ratio of 42%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">First quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.1 billion, significantly lower than the fourth quarter and 6% lower than the first quarter of 2015. This is the lowest quarterly level since the second quarter of 2009.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Now I'd like to take you through a few key statistics for the first quarter. Total staff was approximately 36,500, down 1% from year-end 2015. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 28%. Our global core liquid assets ended the first quarter at $196 billion and our balance sheet and level 3 assets were $878 billion and $24 billion, respectively. Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 12.2% under the Basel III Advanced approach. It was 13.4% using the Standardized approach. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 6%. And finally, we repurchased 10 million shares of common stock for $1.55 billion in the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In conclusion, the first quarter was obviously a difficult period for our clients, the markets and our opportunity set. While clearly we don't control the opportunity set, we proactively took action in key areas that we do control: our cost structure and our capital. In addition, this is the first quarter in a while that we faced significant headwinds across each of our business segments. Given that we operate in a cyclical industry, it shouldn't be surprising that there will be difficult quarters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">That being said, we don't create deep client relationships in a quarter, we don't hire our people for a quarter, and we certainly don't build businesses for a quarter. Our success has been predicated on having a strong culture that promotes both a long-term perspective, while simultaneously being very focused on managing to the current environment. That long-term focus has been the foundation for building a leading global investment bank and creating superior results for our shareholders.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As we look forward, we are committed to remaining nimble and efficient operators, disciplined capital allocators and prudent risk managers. Our commitment to these principles has been and will continue to be the basis for our performance over time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Thanks again for dialing in, and I'm happy to answer your questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p4\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Please limit yourself to one question and to one follow-up question. Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Paul Schorr - Evercore ISI</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Hi. Thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Hey, good morning, Glenn.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Paul Schorr - Evercore ISI</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Good morning. Maybe we could talk about Fixed Income first. I'm just looking big picture. Revenue is a little more than half the big banks and that was obviously not always the case. I'm just curious, are there specific things about your business mix and client mix that doesn't compare as much versus the past in activity levels, things like credit being real slow right now? And if you feel like any of the balance sheet reductions or Volcker implementation has impacted the forward earnings power?</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Obviously, I don't have great transparency into the competitors' footprints. I don't think that any of the things you mentioned, sort of the balance sheet actions we've taken because they've been very surgical \u2013 although meaningful they've been very surgical over time and very thoughtfully executed. I don't think those are issues and, obviously, all firms have adjusted to Volcker. So, I don't think those are drivers. I think when you look at the year-over-year, obviously, we had a very strong first quarter 2015 relative to the peer set. And I know revenue is the most transparent benchmark you have. But when you look at the performance in the first quarter, obviously we outperformed in the first quarter of last year and obviously much more challenging for us this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Paul Schorr - Evercore ISI</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Yeah, totally fair. Okay. Maybe if we switch over to Investing &amp; Lending. I want to focus on the equity side specifically. In some markets, you had the markets go down and then come back. Asia didn't snap back. So, I wonder if you could talk about the contribution of that in the quarter. And then, more importantly, for the equity dynamic going forward, like maybe size the portfolio fair value versus cost basis, see if there are any marks in the quarter that, knock on wood don't repeat next quarter? And then just see if you can update us on what's left to sell down to get compliant?</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">So, okay, that's a multipart question. So if I miss anything, get back.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Paul Schorr - Evercore ISI</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">All right.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">No, it's fine. So in terms of the I&amp;L balance sheet, let's just start there. The I&amp;L balance sheet is $99 billion. Of that, in terms of \u2013 you spoke about equity, roughly $15 billion of that is corporate equity. In terms of the equity line, both private and public, basically the public portfolio was down roughly $140 million during the quarter and that was offset by private marks. Of those marks that were positive, they were virtually all event-related. And you remember, that's the language you use, Glenn, to describe the fact that there's a sale or a refinancing and then there were negative marks in the portfolio obviously also. So that's really the structure in terms of the course of the quarter. In terms of Volcker, because I think you're asking about the equity funds?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Paul Schorr - Evercore ISI</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Yes. Correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So, in terms of Volcker, basically if we start at the top of, let's just say the waterfall, there's $7.5 billion in covered funds. You then have to take out approved Volcker activities. Then you take out the public money. And the way we've asked you to look at it is there's roughly $4.5 billion remaining. And that money obviously sits alongside our clients in these funds. Is there anything else you asked that I missed?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Paul Schorr - Evercore ISI</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">No, that's perfect. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Your next question is from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) LLC (Broker)</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Good morning, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Morning, Christian.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) LLC (Broker)</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So you mentioned a mix shift in asset management impacting revenues. Can you give a bit more color on this and if you expect it to reverse going forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year as we work through, obviously, there are various client segments we work with, whether they're retail clients, private wealth, also institutional clients. And what we're really seeing is a mix shift more to institutional mandates during the period. That had an impact. I think longer term, obviously, I can't predict the longer term. We're looking to basically provide service to all those clients as best we can through long, long cycles. But you're seeing obviously the positive inflows which are quite good. So if you ask me to think of the future, I would point more to the flows than the asset mix.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) LLC (Broker)</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Okay, thank you. And then on the GE deposits that you got in, just curious how we should think about what kind of economics you can earn on that and any time line for deployment?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So the transaction closed on Friday. It went quite smoothly. We're up and running under the GS moniker. I would encourage you to think of this really as we've described it, which is, this is all part of our funding diversification. In that sense, we always, as you know, look to have a diversified funding base. This is just an extra toolkit for us in the financing and so we'll view it over time. But in terms of driving revenues, it's really part of our liability management strategy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) LLC (Broker)</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Okay, helpful. And then a very quick modeling question for me. Tax rate was a bit lower in the quarter. Just curious how we should think about the go-forward tax rate?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Yeah. So in terms of the go-forward, I guess if I was to give you a best estimate, I'd say something similar to last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) LLC (Broker)</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay, great. Thank you very much, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Thanks, Christian.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Hi. Thanks a lot.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Hey, Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Hi. Harvey, maybe first just on the revenue backdrop, I just wanted to get your sense when you look at the January/February trends versus, say, March/April, maybe areas where you're starting to the see some improving trends. I know in any given quarter it's kind of tough on, I think, the market share standpoint, but I feel like when revenues are weak you can't really tell market share and then when revenues rebound, you can figure out who gained and who lost. But just given some of the competitive dynamics, just wanted to get a sense if you're starting to see any of that in terms of the market share?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So, I just want to make sure understand \u2013 I answer your question completely. In terms of the quarter, the way I would describe it is March was better than February and February was better than January. It's early in April, so it's obviously pretty early in the quarter, but I would say that it really feels like many of the factors that were impacting the market in the first quarter, particularly early on, seem to have abated and although the market feels a little fragile from all that, it feels like \u2013 for the most part, that feels like that's behind us. But we'll see how the year progresses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">In terms of the longer-term observation around the competitive dynamic, again, in a quarter like this, hard to see it when our clients are experiencing such volatility and such stress, but I think based on announcements and parts of the business where we're seeing client flows move, engagement with clients is quite good and we're getting good feedback. So I think a quarter like we just had actually only makes the competitor forward look better, but we'll see.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay, that's helpful. And then just on, I guess, I&amp;L and Investment Management, obviously I&amp;L had some pressure and then Investment Management, just like the performance fees were weaker than expected. When you look at what has happened through the quarter and the rebound in the markets, I'm trying to just gauge on the parts of the business that are as simple as markets are up and so you should start to see some improving trends versus maybe on like the I&amp;L, you mentioned the provision on the debt side. So how significant or how much follow through are we going to see that could maybe weigh on that part of the business? And same thing on the incentive fees or the performance fees in Investment Management. I don't know if there's a way to gauge the types of products that generate the performance fees, how much are absolute versus relative or what products are below hurdles?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Yes, so as it relates to I&amp;L, just to level set everyone, obviously we created that disclosure to provide more transparency, and that is, as you described it, the most price-sensitive asset parts of the balance sheet. And so that's why I provide it that way. So, as I mentioned, for example, there are parts of the portfolio, as you know, that are public equity securities where, again, we may sit alongside our clients. As those are monetized out of a fund, there are restrictions and lockup periods. And so that portfolio, as I mentioned, was negative roughly $140 million during the course of the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And so there will be some element idiosyncratic movement. Sometimes that portfolio will outperform. When you look at history, it has generally outperformed. Even if you take the last eight quarters including this quarter, the entire I&amp;L segment has generated $11 billion in revenues. In terms of incentive fees, it's going to be specific, obviously, to performance, which has been solid, but obviously markets are going to have an influence on incentive fees also.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. Thanks a lot.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Morning, Matt.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Can you hear me?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Matt, are you there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Yep. Can you hear me?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Yeah. We can hear you now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. Sorry about that. Just a big picture question. Can you just talk a bit about the disconnect between the markets, the improvement that we're seeing there and what still feels like sluggish client activity, maybe better than January/February, but here's the S&amp;P up a couple percent year-to-date, credit spreads have tightened. I guess the question is, like, is it a timing issue where we need more stability for activity to pick up in a bigger way, or is it the underlying economy's not strong enough? Just any big picture thoughts you have on that disconnect?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So something that I think you're certainly seeing a pickup \u2013 if you look at IPOs, I think there were something in the first couple weeks of April approaching 40 IPOs during the first couple weeks. So certainly elements of the marketplace which obviously slowed down very specifically. But I think after a tough first quarter like the whole market has experienced, I think that there may be a slow reaction function in terms of how various market participants engage the marketplace. But it feels like, as I said before, the most significant factors impacting the first quarter seem to have abated, at least for now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. And then just kind of on an incremental basis, like where do you feel like the engagement \u2013 you mentioned the IPOs picking up, but I guess a timeline? Usually you see trading pick up first and then M&amp;A tends to lag, or what do you think we see beyond IPOs in terms of areas that start to pick up first, assuming we get a pickup in activity?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">I think generally I would agree with your statement over very long periods of time, but I think in terms of the M&amp;A cycle that we're in now, while off a little bit from the levels of 2015, the level of dialogue there feels quite good. As I mentioned, our backlog across advisory, equity and debt is up year-over-year after a strong year. So the dialogue and level of engagement feels quite good at this stage. Certainly there was an element to the first quarter which had a bit of a chilling effect for a period, but right now the dialogue feels good. We'll see how it goes in the future.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. And then just separately on expenses, obviously good cost control in a tough revenue quarter. You did mention about continuing to manage to a difficult revenue environment if that continues, but maybe just expand on that? We've seen some things in the media about further cost cuts coming. So, anything you can elaborate on the cost side would be helpful.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So obviously we're \u2013 look, we always have our eye on ways we can look to operate more efficiently. We've talked about it a lot, that this is a performance-driven culture, and the performance wasn't great in the first quarter and as a result you saw compensation and benefits expense down 40% year-over-year. Again, that's our culture, and so you're going to see those adjustments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">In terms of other cost initiatives, I know there's been a lot of stuff in the press. I guess I would really summarize it as follows. I would just say we're shareholders and we're doing things that you would expect shareholders to do.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. All right. Fair enough. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Good morning, Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hi. The CEO letter talks about secular changes versus cyclical changes and you guys have been steadfast saying that the markets are simply in a cyclical lull, they'll recover. They haven't recovered but you've kept your infrastructure. So at what point do you say maybe these cyclical lulls are more permanent and you need to take more dramatic actions? And it looks like year-over-year your trading is the worst among the five big U.S. wholesale banks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So I think I just want to clarify one thing. Because I think one of the messages that maybe gets mistranslated as it comes across is \u2013 and let's just pick FICC, because I think that's really what you're talking about when you talk about trading. We have expressed a commitment to FICC. What we mean by that, very explicitly, is we're committed to our clients and we're committed to providing superior returns over the cycle. Commitment does not mean inaction, and I think that's what gets a little bit confused in this message. And actually, as far as I can tell, Mike, all of our U.S. peers, they're committed to FICC, too.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">But back to Goldman Sachs for a second. If you think about the things we've done over the last couple of years, since the middle of 2013 we've taken the ICS balance sheet down 25% and FICC RWAs, market and credit down 30%. On the cost side \u2013 we've been very focused on the capital side, and on the cost side since the beginning of 2012, we've taken FICC related head count down 10, and we've taken compensation down by more than 20%. So, I wouldn't say that there's been any inaction. However, I would reiterate that we've been quite committed to our clients and committed to the return.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Now, look, this has been, and I admit it, because I agree with you, Mike, this has been a tough period and this has been a long cycle. But we have a long history of managing our business across the cycle. In 2009, we didn't overinvest in the top, and we're going to be thoughtful about not underinvesting but we are certainly responding to the last several years of decline in (30:04) revenue.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I guess, as a follow-up, I mean, what else can you do? You've danced pretty well the last three to four years without revenue growth, but it seems like you're getting to the end of what you can do and your return on equity is now in the single-digit range, and I think consensus has it in the single-digit range for the year. I know you would not want to see that. So what are your other options?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Well, look. I think you're right to point out that for four years running we are one of the very small handful of firms that have had double-digit ROEs. This is a quarter, I certainly wouldn't sit here and tell you, we are happy about this quarter, but we will do what it takes over time to make sure that we deliver for our clients and maximize the returns for our shareholders in a prudent way. So we are quite focused.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">All right. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thanks, Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Hi. Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Good morning, Betsy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Couple of questions on the fixed income line or the debt line on the I&amp;L?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yeah.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So, typically I think the NII is around $225 million quarter, and I know you posted $87 million, and you indicated the delta is largely due to energy. I'm just wondering, should I take that to mean that the reserve, or the provision, or the mark-to-market in energy was around $138 million or is there more there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So the NII was roughly $240 million and then the offset within provisions, and the majority the offset, about two thirds was in energy related.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. So that feels like it would probably double the reserve ratio that you had posted last quarter. Is that \u2013 it would more than double it. Is that a reasonable assumption? Or maybe you could talk us through how you're thinking about them?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">No, it is not. When you actually look at it \u2013 I think the best way to look at this is with the funded portion of the non-investment grade portion of the energy portfolio. It was high-single digits last quarter, and it remains high-single digits.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. And that's because you either used some of the provision to \u2013 you wrote off some of your exposure? Is that accurate or...</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Well, the exposure \u2013 why don't I just walk you through it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Sure.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So \u2013 yeah. So in the oil and gas sector, this period, including funded, unfunded, investment-grade and non-investment grade was $10.7 billion. That's up from $10.6 billion in the fourth quarter. Now let's just focus on non-investment grade. Non-investment grade is $5 billion. That's up from $4.2 billion. In part, obviously that's driven up by ratings downgrades and actions by the ratings agencies during the course of the quarter, and the funded portion of that is $1.6 billion, and that was up about $100 million. So you can kind of matrix back through all that, and you can see the shift in the portfolio was a result of the ratings agencies.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Got it. And then just ticky-tacky, is the fully phased in for the capital ratios, the CET1, the SLR?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So on the fully phased-in ratios, they are flat quarter-over-quarter, advanced is a 11.7%, and standardized is 12.9%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. Great. All right. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thank you, Betsy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Hey, Guy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research US LP</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Hey, good morning. So I'm going to ask a question that's really going to drill down on one that came a couple of minutes ago on the degree of commitment to FICC in particular. Goldman is obviously a leader in applying technology to traditional voice trading businesses and other things, and you've been pretty vocal in the past about how you transformed equities, and foreign exchange, and cut head count while picking up market share and the process. It seems like FICC has really reached a tipping point recently because of regulatory change and what's going on in the markets and yet the digitization process is maybe trickier in FICC. And, so I was hoping you could give us some color on how much transformation do you expect in the capital structure and the expense structure of fixed income for your business?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Well, first and foremost I'd say the thing that drive the strategy is not digitization in and of itself, it's how we engage our clients. You're right to point out that the equity business went through a pretty significant evolution. While that evolution in historical perspective feels short, it was a multiyear process that really began in 1999 and it finished in the mid 2000s and continues to evolve. I don't know necessarily that I would agree with that we're at a tipping point. It's all about opinions. But it feels like we're in an evolution where obviously clients are looking for efficiencies and we're looking for efficiencies, but the reality is that a vast majority of the fixed income market is more bespoke; it won't lend itself to that. But to the extent to which we can deliver to our clients and drive efficiencies, we're obviously very focused on it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research US LP</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So, is it right though, for us to think that there is going to be a significant transformation in the cost structure and the capital structure that you apply to FICC over the next couple of years? Or would that be too dramatic?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Well I think, look, you've seen some of the evolutionary steps we've taken in terms of the balance sheet reductions and the risk-weighted assets that I talked about earlier. It may be the case that over periods of time, depending on how much client activity there is, but the extent to which it shifts to electronic channels like we've seen under the regulatory framework for swap execution facilities, those transitions happen very, very quickly, and we adjust very, very quickly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research US LP</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. That's helpful in terms of perspective. Thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Sure. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question is from the line of Kian Abouhossein with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kian Abouhossein - JPMorgan Securities Plc</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yeah. Morning, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Good morning, Kian.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kian Abouhossein - JPMorgan Securities Plc</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Just wondering on market share movements, how you see that progressing, considering we have clear strategies of reduction of some of the European IBs as well as Nomura now. How do you see that coming through in your numbers? Do you see that at this point? And how you position to take part of these market share gains as others are retrenching?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So, as you and I talked about over the last couple of years, I don't think we would have imagined a couple of years ago that the industry would be in a position where three of the largest firms were going through a change in leadership and what appears to be a very, very significant change in strategy. That change in strategy is different for all of them, some of them it's geographically driven, some so far, some of it is pulling resources back from certain businesses like derivatives.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">To us, it feels like the feedback is quite good. Obviously difficult to see that in a really tough first quarter, but I would say on the ground, the feedback is good and it continues to improve our position. With respect to how we're positioned, I think we feel tremendously well positioned given our footprint.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kian Abouhossein - JPMorgan Securities Plc</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. And in respect to your fixed income business, looking at your VaR in commodities, it declined a lot year on year, although volatility must have gone up in the commodity space. I'm just wondering it looks to me there's been a proactive reduction overall in the first quarter. Do I understand that correctly? And did that have an impact on your revenue impact in FY 2016? Just trying to put the picture together.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yeah. So, as I spoke about in the early remarks, commodities were down year-over-year, that really \u2013 the VaR reductions you're really seeing are more reflection of the environment. While there was volatility during the course of the period, obviously in commodities, client flows were pretty muted as people really were a bit taken back, I wouldn't say in shock, but a bit taken back by the depressed energy prices and the movement down. It didn't translate into lots of activity during the course of the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kian Abouhossein - JPMorgan Securities Plc</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And if I may, just follow-up on that, do you see an improvement through March and April, both in liquidity terms and in terms of a client activity in the space?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yeah. As I said before, March was better than February and February was certainly better than January. So I would say that's been the general trend. As I said before, the factors that really were impacting the market so severely in the first quarter, at least for now, they seem to have abated.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kian Abouhossein - JPMorgan Securities Plc</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question is from the line of James Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Hey, good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Just wanted to \u2013 I hate to beat a dead horse, but maybe just talk about FICC a little bit, maybe just more strategically? With regulators sort of turning their eyes to the buy-side and potentially cracking down on leverage and forcing more liquidity, do you worry that that just sort of postpones any cyclical recovery in the investor class trading? And then I guess as I corollary to that, could you \u2013 is it possible to sort of pivot towards more the plain vanilla flow businesses that are \u2013 corporate-driven flow businesses that the big universal banks seem to be benefiting from in terms of stability? Is there opportunities set there to kind of crack their market share on those businesses?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yeah. So I would say with respect to the liquidity dynamic, if I had to rank factors and it's very hard to quantify these things, I would say factors like conviction around the markets because of the sharp decline in the oil price and obviously the negative interest rate environment and the big shift to, as you said, the buy-side holding lots of assets, I think those are as significant a driver in the current environment as is regulation, given that banks are holding less inventory globally. I think that underpinning all of that is that when you look at the client base, regardless of how much velocity may be in their current trading activities quarter-to-quarter, the core needs in terms of their need for liquidity and our desire to provide it, that remains. So I think the core of it is the same.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. And do you see any value in trying to sort of capture more market share in the corporate-driven flow business?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">The extent to which we can \u2013 sorry, I didn't mean to ignore the last part of your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yeah.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I think you're right to say that, obviously, the big universal banks, they're two or three times our size, they have a much bigger lending profile and a bigger retail commitment. So they will naturally participate in some flows that, given their size, we won't participate in. But the value is really in servicing the client and so the extent to which we can provide value to a client, obviously, we want to make sure we're doing that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay, that's helpful. And just maybe just one quick question on M&amp;A activity and capital restructurings in the energy space, it's been a hot topic of whether we see some significant pickup in activity in that space as prices stabilize. Are you seeing that? Are you seeing sort of conversations and potential activity pickup there that we could see later in the year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So we saw, obviously, to the extent to which there were financings in the first quarter, they're obviously energy-related financing activity and we were very involved in that. I would say that, look, the space has been under extreme stress which emerged over a fairly short period of time, measured more in months than years, and so I think our expectation that there will be active dialogue across the industry. Whether or not that manifests itself immediately in the near term, we'll have to see, but obviously the industry is going through quite a bit in this price environment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay, great. Thanks for your help.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Good morning. Just a couple quick ones. On trading broadly, thinking about the importance of hedge funds to your trading business, should we temper our expectations for a bounce back here in your revenues, even if we see some market improvement, given the pressure that that client base has experienced this year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yeah. So, look, we think of all of our clients as important, but obviously, we've had a big commitment to the hedge fund industry across equities and fixed them for a long time. We're always rooting for their performance, and so to the extent to which they have improved performance, it may be a catalyst for increased activity. Because in periods like we went through in the first quarter, obviously, they have a tendency to derisk and it reduces trading velocity over many months, although it may be, for example, an active day from time to time. But I think sentiment seems to be improving, but we're going to have to say, as I said before, it's still a little fragile.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay, okay, thanks. And then just one more follow-up on the backlog. Could you maybe help us out a little bit on, number one, how we could see \u2013 I think you indicated in the press release that sequentially down quarter-over-quarter on the backlog. But I would have guessed that there might have been maybe some extension from 1Q into 2Q, so could you maybe help me understand that? And then also if you can give any color on some of the deal funding markets and high yield markets and whether there's been some healing and improvement in the backlogs there, given how stressed they were in 1Q? Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Sure. So, as I mentioned, the backlog was down sequentially, but it's up year-over-year. When you look across the business, the advisory portion of backlog was down versus very strong level at the end of the year, but that's up year-over-year. Versus the end of the year, as we would imagine, given what happened in the equity markets, the equity backlog is up and obviously we had a bit of an outperformance, it looks like, versus the rest of the industry on debt underwriting, and that's down sequentially. In terms of the high yield markets, over the last couple of weeks, still a bit selective, but they seem quite strong, one of the largest transactions was done just last week and so the markets are quite receptive to good solid transactions. Are you there, Brennan?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Oh yeah. Yeah. Sorry. Thanks. Appreciate it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">No problem.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Hi. Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Good morning, Steven.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So, Harvey, I appreciated the color that you've given on some of the factors that were impacting market liquidity, and I know that one of the Fed Governors had recently spoken on the topic and suggested that that reduction in liquidity is a cost worth paying for to help the overall financial system. And given the regulators' willingness to sacrifice that liquidity to ensure improved safety and soundness, I'm just wondering how that informs your strategy on balance sheet and inventory management? Have you considered the fact that there might not be any relief on the regulatory side in the context of your longer-term strategy for the business?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So I think \u2013 look, you have to give the regulators a lot of credit over the last several years for making \u2013 and I'll focus more on the U.S. financial system, including things like CCAR. I think that the safety and soundness of the large U.S. banks and the whole system, they deserve a lot of credit for driving some of that. Obviously, we made a lot of changes to our balance sheet even prior to the regulations, but I think you have to give them a lot of credit for it. I think that all these good benefits which we all benefit from, they come at some marginal cost. It's very hard to measure that marginal cost.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I don't know. I have yet to see a very good analysis that breaks down in great detail the impact of negative rates, the fact that we had declining spreads for multiple years that increased asset holdings for mutual funds compared to the shrinkage of bank balance sheets and come up with something that really does a great cost-benefit analysis. I don't think we've seen that. But I think we have to argue the benefits are pretty clear.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Now, as it informs our strategy, look, we have an obligation to deliver to our clients and we have an obligation to make sure that we comply with the rules in the way that we can most thoughtfully. And so that's how we approach our strategy. To the extent to which there was demand for the balance sheet and client activity picked up and that demand was accretive to returns, we'd be happy to grow the balance sheet, given the strength of our capital ratios. But we just haven't seen that, so you're not seeing us do this. But over time, the system is going to have to balance liquidity needs and I think that will happen. It just may take a while.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Got it. And I know you touched on some of the emergence of some of the electronic trading platforms. I'm just wondering has that in fact translated into improved liquidity in certain product areas.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Well, I think if you go back to history, even ignoring the recent regulatory changes that both clients and market providers participated in, if you go back to some of the formation of Tradeweb back into the early 2000s, I think all of those vehicles, and there may have always been challenges at the start, whether it's TRACE reporting or Tradeweb or things like that. I think over time, those generally have been at the margin, maybe not in all cases, they've contributed to increased liquidity. I think so far the markets have adjusted to things, as I said before, very well and the regulators have done a very good job of introducing swap execution facilities and gradually implementing these things.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So I think the extent to which those things have occurred has been helpful. I think where most people talk about liquidity in the marketplace really relates to transacting corporate credit and high yield credit and I don't know of a technological solution that is sort of a cure-all for that. It's all very bespoke and that may be an area that for a while the market struggles with, but not just because of regulation, it's because of all the factors I talked about before.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Thanks, Harvey. And one more just follow-up from me. I was hoping you could actually provide some color, just given the focus in the press on Brexit in terms of how you're thinking about the possible impact on your UK operations and maybe more specifically what strategies you're considering to maybe help mitigate the potential impact.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So, obviously, we're paying very close attention to it, whether we're monitoring it from a market and credit risk perspective or from a strategy perspective. As you know, under the framework, as we understand it, it's a multiyear transition to the extent to which Brexit goes under it. But we feel when we look at it, again I want to caveat this given there's a lot of uncertainty \u2013 when we look at it, we feel like in terms of our physical commitment to the region that we're well prepared. But again, there'll be a lot that all of us will learn to the extent to which the referendum goes through on June 23. But that'll be a multiyear process.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Understood, Harvey. Well, thank you for taking my questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Sure. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question is from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Good morning, Harvey. Thanks for taking my question. First, I want to focus a little bit on Investment Management. Revenue was obviously a bit weaker, as you've described. Guess I'm curious as to how you're thinking about the pre-tax margin in that business over the relatively near-term, say the next 12 to 18 months? By my calculation, it's been running in the low 20% range. Do you have designs even in a not so supportive market environment to be able to improve that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So we're obviously always focused on running the business efficiently. We don't target a pre-tax margin for the business. So over time, you may see that move as we're investing in the business, as we're taking on different types of asset pools, but we look at it across the whole business, but we don't target it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. And then just moving on to capital returns, I notice that you issued some preferreds this quarter. I think in the last CCAR test, your constraining factor, in terms of the stress test at least, was the Tier 1 ratio. The preferred issuance should help you with that. Does that help you in terms of thinking about future capital returns?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">The preferred that you saw us do this quarter was the exchange of preferreds. So we were net neutral on the preferreds this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">But you're right to point out that last year \u2013 all the things you point out about last year are accurate. Look, we utilize preferreds to the extent to which they are consistent with our capital plan and our objectives. Generally speaking, as you've heard me say before, we view them as reasonably expensive securities, and so we're not desirous to use them beyond where we think they sort of fit optimally in the capital structure.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. That's helpful. And then just quickly, lastly on energy. It sounded like the vast majority of the increase in the noninvestment grade side was from downgrades. Were there any net draws on the exposure this quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">There were during the quarter. They weren't material, but I don't have that number off the top of my head.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. Thanks, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question is from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thanks. Harvey, I just wanted to follow up just a bit on the pipeline issue. Was there any \u2013 particularly on M&amp;A, has there been any pipeline fallout because of change in political circumstances globally or here domestically because of the change in the Treasury's stance on inversion transactions?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Well, there was one large transaction in the marketplace which looks like in part in response to Treasury actions. It's no longer in the marketplace. We were a participant in that. But I would say that's a minimal factor in the status of the backlog. And so, no, I'd say these are small impacts.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. And so to the extent that macro conditions seem, let's say, broadly unchanged over the past several months, does that continue to support what is generally a very high level of M&amp;A? Or is the tide turning in some way in your view?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So it feels like the fundamental conditions for I'd say an elevated level of M&amp;A activity, they all feel like they're still in place. And those things are challenged top line growth, slow to very moderate GDP growth globally, and so it all feels like it's still in place.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Great. Thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thanks. Good morning, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Devin.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Just want to ask the revenue question maybe another way and maybe from the top down. Just when you think about asset productivity at the firm level or revenues per asset, is it really all about increasing velocity here as client activity hopefully improves? Or are there some things that you can point to around maybe remixing how the balance sheet is weighted over time? I know it's fluid, but just trying to think about the size of really proactive opportunities to improve asset productivity by changing the balance sheet mix outside of just a pickup in client activity?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So we really try never to drive balance sheet to different parts of the firm in a top-down way. It really comes bottom-up, and it comes bottom-up because it's in response to exactly what you're describing. It's client activity. If our bankers need more capital and more liquidity for their clients because they're financing M&amp;A transactions, but we can't \u2013 obviously, from the top, we can't control that from the leadership of the firm. And so it's really in response. So I would say velocity broadly, whether it's in M&amp;A, debt, financing, the ICS businesses, that really is the driving motor for the firm. Obviously, we look to be as thoughtful and efficient about our balance sheet as capital as we can in the context of that, but it really is about velocity and activity levels.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up on expenses. As you guys think about just further steps that could be taken from here to reduce expenses if the backdrop remains challenging, I know you're always evaluating those, but are we at a point where the focus is really on reducing costs or maybe the footprint in low return areas that would reduce revenues but they'd still have a positive net impact? Or are there still some costs in the system that can be removed that don't touch revenues? I ask just because you guys have already done so much on this front.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Well, thanks for acknowledging what we've done over the last couple of years. Look, we're net ROE focused. And net ROE, as I just talked to you about, that's going to be driven in part by client levels of activity. And so, for example, as you know, at the beginning of the year, we go through a firm-wide review of resources, and when you look at that over historical time periods, that's resulted in about a 5% adjustment to resources in the firm. This year as we went through that exercise, parts of the businesses that were more challenged, like fixed income, they elected to take more significant action. And so they would have been greater than 5% during this period. But they're just responding to the market environment and there has been demand for their services in the short run.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Great. Thanks, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Hey, Brian.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Good morning. Just a quick question on energy or the commodities overall within FICC. I mean, you mentioned during your comments that the client activity was low due to the low energy prices, but I think you then clarified that as saying it was really the drop in energy. I just want to make sure I got that straight and that you can still grow the business even at a low level of energy prices, or was it really just because energy prices are low, revenue is going to be low?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Yeah. It's great question. It's less the absolute price level; it was more the shock and the nature of the decline. And so when you think about the precipitous nature of the decline and you go through the various client segments, so think about producers responding to that decline in prices and, for example, certainly you didn't see much incremental addition to hedge portfolio activity. On the consumer side, when you get those moves down so quickly, they tend to be a delay until you find some price stability. And for investors, I think the move was so volatile that it was difficult for investors to participate. We've certainly seen some stabilizing in those flows and increased market participation over the last several weeks. But what we saw in the first quarter, really not surprising in terms of client behavior.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay. Thanks. And then just one question. I know before we get into the next quarter's earnings, we'll have the CCAR results, and over the last couple of years you've been, I guess, not shy about using amalgam with regards to CCAR. Can you kind of outlay how you think about capital return as well as whether or not you're going to always be aggressive in your capital ask within the CCAR process? Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So I wouldn't \u2013 just to get a little ticky-tacky on language, I wouldn't that there's a shyness or lack of shyness or aggression or anything like that. We very specifically and carefully go through our capital plan and we ask for what we think is appropriate. And so that's the way I would describe it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Your next question comes from the line of Richard Bove with Rafferty Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Richard Bove - Rafferty Capital Markets, LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Good morning. I was wondering, if we take as a given that your balance sheet is in pristine condition and that you're the very best, or among the very best in each one of the businesses in which you operate, we run up against a situation that the world has changed dramatically so that we are now nine years into Goldman Sachs not being able to come close to what it did in 2007. Its revenues have been flat-lining for, let's say, five years. Its earnings, pre-tax earnings this year, certainly last year, are half of what you did in 2007. When does Goldman say the time has come for transformational change, that we must do something radically different because we are getting nowhere? We're just treading water for nine years now. The stock is going nowhere. Earnings are going nowhere. Revenues are going nowhere, and yet we are the very best at what we do. When do you start saying we've got to do something radically different? We've got to change?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">So, I guess, I would say a couple of things. First, Dick, over the last several years, as you pointed out, we've been a $34 billion firm. However, we have changed. During that time period, we sold off $2.5 billion-plus worth of businesses, and we replaced those revenues. You've seen us grow our Asset Management business. Over the time period, when you look at our performance versus the peer group, and I thank you for acknowledging we're the best, we've continued to outperform the peers. We've grown book value. We've returned $25 billion to shareholders over the past four years, and so we have done many things.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">We can't control what happens in terms of the environment. We don't believe negative interest rates are going to be here forever. We don't believe the client activity is going to be low forever. And you really have to look at this over long periods of time. Look, I will go back to book value, Dick. If you look at it over the past decade, we've grown it by threefold. I think that's contributing value.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Richard Bove - Rafferty Capital Markets, LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">No. I totally agree with you. I don't see anything wrong with Goldman Sachs. I see things wrong with the world and that Goldman Sachs' position in the world is where things are wrong. And what I'm wondering is, when do you think about doing a massive merger of equals? When do you start thinking about entering new business lines which are radically different from the ones that you're in now under the understanding that you can't get anything more from what you're doing other than waiting for the tide to come in? In other words, when do you get control of your destiny as opposed to sitting here for nine years, letting the world control where you are and what you're doing?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yeah. So, again, it's all about language, Dick. I would agree with some of the things you're saying. I certainly wouldn't agree with your statement that we are sitting here, waiting for the world to do what it does. If we felt like there was a client segment or a transaction we could do that would benefit our shareholders, and we could deliver to those clients, we would do it. We're open-minded. There is a reason why we're the leading advisory firm in the world. We would take our own advice, Dick.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Richard Bove - Rafferty Capital Markets, LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay. Thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Your next question is from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Thanks. Harvey, we'll go from the strategic to the very tactical of my questions here. We've harped on this in the past on kind of the timing of the comp ratio. Year-over-year the expenses were right in line with revenues. But if you look from sequential, you had a 13% reduction in revenues and a 29% increase in your overall compensation. So that combination really created a squeeze on your returns, which if you would have adjusted for that, would have raised your return on tangible common equity by 1.5 percentage points, 2 percentage points in this particular quarter. So just was curious, in the past, it's worked in your favor. This quarter, it really didn't.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">So, look, at this stage, it's our best estimate, Marty, in terms of where we think the year will go. Obviously, the performance was challenged in the first quarter and you saw competition of benefit expense come down 40%. It's pretty meaningful.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">No, it was. I am just saying, sequentially the pattern, it just throws you off, and it creates the pressure on returns in a first quarter that's not strong, but weak. Whereas if you were on the average for the year and kept it kind of constant for the average, then you would have a much more kind of just leveled out playing field that we'd just have a dramatic shift between fourth and first quarter. So that's the way...</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Yeah. I understand your point. It really is our best estimate. We're going to have to see how the year progresses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Fair. The other thing which I know is a hard question to be able to answer, but it's kind of important when you start thinking about just what are the core earnings and trying to take out some of the volatility that happens from quarter to quarter. The I&amp;L business gives you increased tangible book value, it has been a contributor, so there's nothing wrong with it, but the volatility does create pressures and then also advantages in certain quarters. What is your just range? And just kind of you're not think out the recession, but just kind of think about it in general, what would be the range of outcomes given that you do have some NII in there and you would typically have some flow of deals? And it could be a broad range. I was just kind of thinking when you budget or plan for some normality, what's your kind of aspect to what you think about there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">So, when we budget and plan for it, it really is a process through which, because of the nature, again, this is a long-term business, where we're committing long-term capital, it really is done under a very controlled process where the businesses request that capital. As you pointed out, we had roughly $240 million of NII in there. And now the majority of the balance sheet, and this has been in transition over several years, the balance sheet has transitioned more to debt and lending activities, but that is not something, again, that we drove top-down. That was driven by the client demand and the opportunity set. As I said, look, you have to look at this over the long term. As I said earlier, including our first quarter, it's driven $11 billion of revenue over the last eight quarters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Right.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">But you have to look at this at the long term because it's going to be \u2013 it's pro-cyclical and there's going to be volatility quarter to quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">And then the recent history of zero this quarter to $1 billion would be kind of the range we've been seeing. Is that kind of what you would see?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Well, I would say that this has been a pretty extreme quarter. You have to go back to the third quarter of 2011 or back to other periods where markets have been extremely volatile to see this kind of performance. But, again, it reinforces what we've told you already, which is, it's price sensitive, it's pro-cyclical and quarter to quarter, you really have to look at it over the long term.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">I got you. And you adjust for those two pieces, you put it to an average in I&amp;L and kind of the average compensation ratio for the year and you're really at 9.5% kind of returns. So that's the benefit you'd have as you kind of roll forward. So, thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Well, that's your job.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">That's right.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Thanks, Marty.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">And at this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">So, hey, everybody, since there are no more questions, I'd like to take a moment to thank all of you for joining the call. Hopefully, I and other members of senior management will see many of you in the coming months. If you have any questions come up, please don't hesitate to reach out to Dane.

I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Second Quarter 2016 Earnings conference call. This call is being recorded today, July 19, 2016. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Mr. Holmes, you may begin your conference.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Dane Holmes</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. Today\u2019s call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm\u2019s belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain and outside of the firm\u2019s control. The firm\u2019s actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm\u2019s future results, please see the description of risk factors in our current annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 2015. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our investment banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, global core liquid assets, and supplementary leverage ratio, and you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that\u2019s posed on the Investor Relations portion of our website at <a href=\"http://www.gs.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"><u>www.gs.com</u></a>.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">This audiocast is copyrighted material of the Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Our Chief Financial Officer, Harvey Schwartz, will now review the firm\u2019s results. Harvey?</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thanks Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I\u2019ll walk you through the second quarter results, then I\u2019m happy to answer any questions. Net revenues $7.9 billion, net earnings $1.8 billion, earnings per diluted share $3.72, and our annualized return on common equity was 8.7%. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">As you all remember, the first quarter of 2016 was dominated by renewed uncertainty regarding the global economic outlook. This impacted prices across various asset classes and drove macro headwinds in each of our businesses. Many of the concerns that existed in the first quarter moderated as we started the second quarter. This was a better environment for our clients and our performance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">This was also reflected in equity markets; for example, the S&amp;P 500 was relatively unchanged for most of April and May. In addition, we saw sequential improvements in global investment banking volumes. Activity for the first two months of the quarter was on pace to be up over 20% for equity offerings and nearly 15% for announced M&amp;A; however, as we approached June, the market became increasingly focused on Brexit. The focus was on both the economic uncertainty surrounding the potential outcome and the potential economic implications of leaving the EU. These concerns negatively impacted client sentiment, risk appetite and activity levels heading into the vote. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">In response to the Leave vote on June 23, market volatility spiked and global equity markets declined significantly, with the MSCI World down roughly 7% in two days. While equity markets largely reversed those losses in the last three days of the quarter, clients and the border marketplace continue to wrestle with the Brexit vote and related uncertainty.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">With that as a backdrop, let\u2019s now discuss individual business performance in greater detail. Investment banking produced second quarter net revenues of $1.8 billion, 22% higher than the first quarter as we saw increased client activity across equity and debt underwriting. Our investment banking backlog decreased relative to the end of the first quarter and the year ago. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Breaking down the components of investment banking in the second quarter, advisory revenues were $794 million, up 3% from the first quarter. Year-to-date, Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced and completed M&amp;A. We advised a number of important transactions that were announced during the second quarter, including NorthStar Asset Management\u2019s $16.9 billion tri-party merger with Colony Capital and NorthStar Realty Finance; Great Plains Energy\u2019s $12.2 billion acquisition of Westar Energy, and Hewlett Packard Enterprises\u2019 $8.5 billion spinoff and merger of its enterprise services business with Computer Sciences Corporation. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We also advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the second quarter, including Charter Communications\u2019 $78.7 billion acquisition of Time Warner Cable and $10.4 billion acquisition of Bright House Networks; Visa Inc.\u2019s \u20ac18.7 billion of Visa Europe, and Airgas Inc.\u2019s $13.4 billion sale to Air Liquide. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Moving to underwriting, net revenues were $993 million in the second quarter, up 43% sequentially as capital markets activity picked up from the first quarter. Equity underwriting revenues were $269 million. This was up significantly compared to weak activity in the first quarter due to an increase in IPOs. Debt underwriting revenues were up 42% to $724 million and benefited from asset-backed issuance and strong leveraged finance activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">During the second quarter, we actively supported our clients\u2019 financing needs, participating in Mylan\u2019s $6.5 billion investment-grade offering to support its acquisition of Meda AB; U.S. Foods\u2019 $1.2 billion IPO; and the approximately \u20ac850 million IPO of Philips Lighting. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Turning to institutional client services, which comprises both our FICC and equities businesses, net revenues were $3.7 billion in the second quarter, up 7% compared to the first quarter. FICC client execution net revenues were $1.9 billion in the second quarter, up 16% sequentially as market making conditions improved in many businesses from the first quarter. Credit and mortgages increased as the backdrop for providing liquidity was more normalized compared to the first quarter. Rates was also higher sequentially given better market making conditions. Currencies declined relative to solid client activity levels in the first quarter, and commodities declined slightly during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees, and securities services, net revenues for the second quarter were $1.8 billion, down slightly quarter over quarter. Equities client execution net revenues of $587 million were up 25% sequentially. Better market making conditions for most of the quarter and select corporate activity drove improved performance. Commissions and fees were $745 million, down 15% quarter over quarter as client activity decreased following heightened volumes in the first quarter. Securities services generated net revenues of $422 million, down 2% relative to the first quarter as seasonally stronger client activity was offset by slightly lower customer balances and spreads.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Turning to risk, average daily borrowing in the second quarter was $62 million, down from $72 million in the first quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Moving on to our investing and lending activities, collectively these businesses produced net revenues of $1.1 billion in the second quarter. Equities securities generated net revenues of $626 million primarily reflecting company-specific events, sales, and gains in public equity investments. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $485 million and included more than $250 million of net interest income. In investment management, we reported second quarter net revenues of $1.4 billion, consistent with the first quarter. During the quarter, management and other fees were roughly flat sequentially at $1.2 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Assets under supervision increased $23 billion sequentially to a record $1.31 trillion. The $23 billion increase was substantially driven by $19 billion of net market appreciation. We also had $4 billion of net inflows with $3 billion from liquidity products, and the remainder from long-term fee-based products. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense for the year to date, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity work and other items such as benefits, was accrued at a compensation to net revenues ratio of 42%, consistent with the first half of last year. To respond to the more challenging backdrop, we completed an expense initiative during the first and second quarter. The run rate expense savings will be roughly $700 million. In 2016, these expected savings will be partially offset by severance and other related costs. Second quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.1 billion, up slightly compared to the first quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Now I\u2019d like to take you through a few key statistics. Total staff was approximately 34,800, down 5% from the first quarter. Our effective tax rate for the year to date was 26.8%. Our global core of liquid assets ended the second quarter at $211 billion and our balance sheet was $897 billion. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 12.2% under the Basel III advanced approach. It was 13.7% using the standardized approach. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 6.1%. All of our capital ratios are well in excess of regulatory requirements. This reflects our multi-year effort to de-risk the firm and strengthen our financial profile. Given robust capital ratios, the firm is well positioned to return excess capital to shareholders.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In the quarter, we repurchased 11.1 million common shares of common stock for $1.7 billion. For the five quarter CCAR cycle for 2015, we provided shareholders with $6.2 billion in share buybacks and $1.5 billion in common stock dividends. In terms of this year\u2019s CCAR test, we announced that the Federal Reserve Board did not object to our plan.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In conclusion, the first half of 2016 has certainly presented its fair share of challenges and concerns. At the core of these concerns is the outlook for the global economy. As you have heard us state many times before, confidence in economic growth is the most important long-term driver of our business. Confidence incentivizes client activity, which increases demand for our advice, our content and our execution capabilities. While like the rest of the world we would welcome more robust economic growth, ultimately we have to manage the firm for both the current environment and potential future opportunities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">How we\u2019ve navigated the difficult environment in the first half of 2016 demonstrates both the strength and resilience of our culture. We remain vigilant regarding our cost structure, our capital usage and our risk profile, and at the same time we have maintained the necessary commitment to ensure that we can meet our clients\u2019 needs as they grow.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Being in a position to deliver for our clients and our shareholders requires ongoing investment and a long-term perspective. While we continue to invest in our existing set of businesses, we are also looking for new opportunities. One example is our digital consumer lending platform. While still in its early stages, we expect to begin the initial phase of engaging consumers this fall. As we have discussed with you in the past, we are taking a very deliberate and methodical approach to this effort. We are looking to build a durable business, so it will take time. Similar to our other businesses, creating a valuable and differentiated service for our clients is core to our strategy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In summary, our ability to both react to the current world and simultaneously invest in the future will position the firm to deliver superior value to our clients and our shareholders in the years ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Thanks again for dialing in, and I\u2019m happy to answer your questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p4\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">[Operator instructions]</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Hi, thanks a lot.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Hey, good morning Glenn.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Good morning. A question on comps. It\u2019s always a little touchy, but if you look at it on a year-to-date basis, the ratio is flat with last year but the dollars are down 28% six months year-on-year. So I\u2019m just curious, I know you\u2019ve been remixing a little bit in the employee base. How much of that can help that ratio when you look at it on a full year, and then just how do you balance between a higher ratio versus the 37% you had the last couple of years, three years, and then just having it be a little bit more belt tightening?</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">So obviously 42 at this stage is our best estimate, but incorporated in that is all the steps that we\u2019re taking. So as I communicated, year-to-date the cost efforts themselves on a run rate basis translate into $700 million of run rate savings. Now, after severance that number is going to be more like 350 this year, but obviously we\u2019re staying very focused on this and I think you see that performance has been down, and with that compensation and benefits expenses down 28% year-to-date.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Just so I understand, the\u2014your run rate savings comments - 700, 350 ex-severance, is that in this quarter\u2019s number and therefore just sets a lower bar as we roll through the rest of the year? I just want to make sure what we\u2019re looking at versus what\u2019s on the [indiscernible].</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">The way I would think about it is it\u2019s in 2016, and it gives us operating flexibility. But that\u2019s executed - the $700 million is done. Again, that\u2019s run rate, severance costs and other things.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Okay. Then your comment on the investment banking pipeline\u2019s down, I\u2019m just curious, how much of that is just off of great numbers and as you execute, including the debt underwriting that you talked about, and then versus how much does Brexit play a role in just kind of slowing things down on deals that might have been happening across Europe?</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">So when you look at the backlog, I think one way to look at it is the year-over-year, so if you\u2019re actually standing here at the end of June last year, obviously the second quarter and first half of last year were very dynamic. If you look at the backlog in aggregate, it\u2019s sort of down mid-single digits, and so that\u2019s the trajectory of the backlog. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s surprising coming off of high levels - it is where it is. Obviously our market shares have been very significant.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In terms of Brexit, where we sit today, given I think that the base case expectation is that the dynamic is going to play out over a long period of time, and in some respects it may contribute to some of the same factors that contributed to a very active M&amp;A environment, other than maybe very specific transactions that are geographic in nature, that are really driven by geography, which is generally few, when we talk to our bankers, if we continue in this low growth environment, they don\u2019t feel sitting here today that Brexit is going to be a headwind but obviously it\u2019s going to be a dynamic situation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Okay, I appreciate it. Thanks Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Your next question is from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Good morning, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Hey, good morning Christian. How are you?</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Good, good. Thanks for the update on expenses. I might just ask a question, just to try and understand the knock-on impact of Brexit on your cost base. So do you have a sense, a rough sense of what percentage of your revenues and expenses are denominated in pound sterling? I presume you have significant more cost in sterling than revenues, so curious if the decline in the pound could be a further tailwind to expenses in 2H16.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">No, it\u2019s not the case necessarily that we have significantly more expenses denominated in sterling. There\u2019s a whole host of processes through which we go through in terms of how employees elect to get compensated, et cetera, so that\u2019s an issue obviously we monitor very closely in terms of our foreign currency risk broadly across the globe, managing a global business, but I wouldn\u2019t point to that as a significant consideration, although it\u2019s a consideration of the many things we look at. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">In terms of Brexit, the way I would frame it for you is I\u2019d say there\u2019s sort of the near-term observations I can give you and then sort of a longer term perspective. The near-term ones would be just sort of going through the process. Now, obviously we were preparing for Brexit well in advance, even though we all expected it to be a very, very unlikely outcome, but we were significantly prepared for that and that really left us in a position, we feel, to be very front footed with clients. Going into Brexit, client activity tapered off, but at the point of Brexit and potentially thereafter in a number of our businesses, we either near-peak volumes or peak volumes, or new peaks, so that was quite good to see.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">In terms of the longer term perspective on Brexit, as I said before, this looks like this process is going to take a while, and we\u2019re hopeful, along with everyone else, that the parties that are engaged in these negotiations will be prudent and thoughtful because obviously it\u2019s good for all of us, a thoughtful negotiation and outcome will just be good for economic growth. As it relates to our business, we\u2019ve been in Europe and the U.K. for a very long period of time, and we\u2019re completed committed to our clients in the region, and regardless of how these negotiations go, we\u2019re going to make sure that we\u2019re there for them. That would be my broad comment on Brexit.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Great. Thanks for the detailed response. On debt underwriting, very, very strong numbers and well in excess of what we can see in the kind of public lead tables. So just curious maybe if you can detail some of the growth initiatives around the debt underwriting business and particularly any color on businesses that we would not typically be able to see in the public lead tables. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So one of the drivers in this quarter, as I referenced, was an asset-backed related activity, and there was one significant transaction where earlier on, we had committed capital to purchase a portfolio, which ultimately translated through in the debt underwriting line that would not be included in a lead table, so it\u2019d be difficult for you to see.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Okay, thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Thanks Christian.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Thanks Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Hey, how are you?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Good. First, just on the G-SIB surcharge, just wanted to get an update where you stand, and then probably more importantly when you think of wanting to reduce that versus taking advantage of opportunities to take market share, just given some of the exits that we\u2019ve seen throughout the industry, just want to get a sense on where you\u2019re at and kind of the pullback versus the growth, just given some of the dislocations out there with some of the competitors.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Yes, so you\u2019re right - I would summarize it because I think you framed it well. It\u2019s a bit of a balance, and so at this stage we\u2019re at 2.5 on the surcharge. Obviously we\u2019re very focused on reducing our systemic footprint. We believe that and all firms obviously should make that a priority; but you\u2019re right to say that as the competitive environment is shifting and a number of our competitors have stated restructuring plans, we want to make sure that in all of our efforts, whether it\u2019s managing our capital, that we\u2019re focused on costs, that we remain full service across all of our businesses and we\u2019re there for our clients. We believe at this stage we\u2019ve found that balance, and for shareholders it gives them a lot of operating leverage.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay, got it. Just as a follow-up, I guess just two things on the regulatory side. So with CCAR, I know you guys don\u2019t disclose what you\u2019re going to do, but just from a quarter as we kind of go through the third quarter through 2017, should we expect the same type of ramp that we saw last year just in terms of the lighter up front and then the heavier buybacks as that plays out? And then just any update on the\u2014you know, you guys\u2019 capital and funds that would have to be liquidated in 2017? I guess just when you think about those investments, any way for us to gauge where those are marked or where the potential gains could be as those are exited over time?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So what\u2019s expected of CCAR and the CCAR process, obviously you say the 11.1 million shares this quarter and the 1.7 billion-plus in dollar buybacks, so last year\u2019s test had some idiosyncrasies in it which led to this profile where, to the extent of which and we ended up using capacity that we\u2019re repurchasing, that we were more constrained in the early quarters versus the later quarters. And even though we don\u2019t disclose the buyback capacity, and you know we don\u2019t want shareholders to conflate that with dividends, and that\u2019s why we don\u2019t, the profile that you would expect this year doesn\u2019t have those idiosyncratic elements to it, so the extent to which we repurchase, it won\u2019t necessarily follow that profile. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">In terms of the\u2014I think what you\u2019re asking, the question really relates to the harvesting in the funds. Is that what you\u2019re asking?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Yes, that\u2019s it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay. So I\u2019ve walked you through that, for lack of better language, that waterfall, so why don\u2019t I just do that. So right now, dollars that are invested predominantly alongside our clients, where we act as a fiduciary, is $7.3 billion. There is $900 million that you would characterize as permitted under the Vogel rule. That leaves us with $6.4 billion. Of the $6.4 billion, $2.1 billion is public; that leaves us with $4.3 billion that is still private sitting alongside those funds.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Actually, I think you asked a question\u2014did you ask a question about - I tried to write them all down. Did you ask a question about how we mark them?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Q - Michael Carrier</strong><br></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Well you know, because these would be relatively seasoned. I was just trying to get a sense on based on the investment versus where it is today, is it running at 1.5 times the cost when you invested? Just trying to get a sense of where things are marked in terms of what the potential gain could be.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">I understand. Yes, so we mark everything to fair value, so we\u2019re marking it quarter to quarter. So whatever gains or losses that are occurring in those investments, you\u2019re seeing those translate through every quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Got it, okay, but we don\u2019t have a cost base versus a fair value, meaning to\u2014</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">It\u2019s across multiple funds, and so I don\u2019t have an aggregate number for you on that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay, all right. Thanks a lot.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">The funds have obviously performed well - you\u2019ve seen that translate through the performance over the last couple years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Your next question is from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O\u2019Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Good morning. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Hey Matt, how are you?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O\u2019Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Good, thank you. Could you talk a little bit more about investment management in terms of why the fees were so weak there, say, versus a year ago? I realize a lot of it is the incentive fees, which tend to be lumpy, but even the other, call it more [indiscernible] like fees were sluggish. Is there something on the timing of when you collect, say, versus equity prices and the volatility there, or is there something else going on?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So the biggest driver in the quarter when you look year-over-year is obviously the incentive fees, and that\u2019s reflective of the environment and incentive fees from time to time are going to be lumpy. With respect to the management and other fees, it really is just about mix and the average fee coming down, although offset in part by the fact that obviously [indiscernible] has grown pretty significantly year over year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O\u2019Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay, and I guess what exactly is the negative mix shift? I mean, obviously liquidity under supervision has increased, but it seems like the overall balances for equity and fixed income really across the board, it seems like the balances have increased. When you talk about the mix shift, what exactly is that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So as you know, in the business obviously we have a number of different client segments so it\u2019s full service across a number of different lines. One of those lines is large advisory institutional mandates. Those mandates, given their size, tend to come at a lower fee base, and so that\u2019s really the mix shift. So it\u2019s basically away from classic mutual funds and into those types of mandates. You can see\u2014I think we break it out for you in the 10-Q, you can see all that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O\u2019Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. Then just separately on the bank initiative, you did mention about rolling out the digital consumer lending platform in the fall. But just more broadly speaking, maybe give us an update on where you are on the lending thought process overall, and then on the deposit side as well, I think you did the brand conversion of the deposit acquisition this past quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Yes, so by view of the separate banks, this one\u2019s really about liability management. Are you talking about the GE deposit acquisition? Is that what you\u2019re asking about in terms of the brand acquisition? Is that what you\u2019re talking about?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O\u2019Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Yes, okay, so why don\u2019t I just start there and I\u2019ll take your question in reverse. So we view those\u2014obviously that\u2019s separate in terms of\u2014obviously we view asset liability management as an integrated exercise, but those two efforts are separate. But having said that, the acquisition went quite well, added in excess of $15 billion of deposits to the firm. It\u2019s great for us because it diversifies our sources of funding, which as you know we\u2019re always looking to do. Since the acquisition date, it\u2019s been well received by consumers - we\u2019ve had in excess of 20,000 consumers open up new accounts for us, so it\u2019s had very significant growth in a short period of time. So it really speaks to the brand strength, which has been very nice to see.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Now in terms of the longer term objectives, maybe I\u2019ll just take an opportunity to level set you on where we are in the online lending. So as we talked about, we hired Harit over a year ago and he\u2019s been a fantastic addition to the team, and he\u2019s built a very capable team over that period of time. So I think it\u2019s probably important just to level set you on how we approach this process.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So we\u2019ve obviously keenly aware of the fact that this is a new business opportunity for us and, importantly, a new client base, so one of the things we did is we reached out to thousands of consumers to really understand what they want and their borrowing priorities. Through that, we learned some things that probably aren\u2019t so surprising - they want a product that\u2019s simple, it\u2019s straightforward, it provides a lot of value, and they also want what they refer to as really a high quality user experience. So what we have attempted to do is take all this feedback, we developed one product. I\u2019ve emphasized\u2014you know, we\u2019ve emphasized a number of times that we\u2019re going to be very deliberate and slow with this, so we\u2019ve developed one product which we plan to launch later this fall, so that\u2019s where we stand [indiscernible] over the next several months.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O\u2019Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay, and sorry - what is that one product? Is it an unsecured loan, or what\u2019s the\u2014</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yes, it\u2019s an unsecured consumer loan product.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O\u2019Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. Would they ask\u2014I mean, target a customer of kind of short duration, small loan size, bigger loan size? What\u2019s kind of the\u2014</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">We\u2019ll come back with all those details in the fall.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O\u2019Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay, fair enough. Okay, thanks for all the answers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Morning, Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hi. So headcount was down a lot just over three months, I guess down 5%. Is that right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">That\u2019s correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So where were those\u2014where did those headcount reductions occur?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So in terms of the headcount process, the process itself really started back in February in terms of our analytics. Now as you know, Mike, we go through\u2014what gets a lot of attention is that we referred to it as a review of the 5%. In years, it varies. Sometimes those reviews yield small reductions, sometimes we actually add people. It varied by business. Obviously for businesses that have hit heavier headwinds, like fixed income, they elected to go beyond the 5% in terms of their exercise, and then there are supporting businesses that are adjacent there, so things like ops and tech. This is a broad exercise across the firm.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Now, I would point out again that this is netted against hiring, so we\u2019re still hiring, and so\u2014but the 5%, as I pointed out, on a run rate basis it\u2019s $700 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I\u2019m sorry - what\u2019s $700 million?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">$700 million is the cost savings on a run rate basis associated with that exercise.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And that\u2019s not reflected in the second quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">It is reflected in the quarter to the extent to which it\u2019s reflected in our compensation accrual, which is our best estimate for the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay, so what was the gross headcount reduction? Net is 5%, before the hiring, was it 6 or 7%?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">The biggest addition offsetting that would have been, for example, roughly 600 new analysts that joined the firm in June.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">That\u2019s a really big headcount reduction in just three months. How do you know that you did it correctly? I mean, did you cut into muscle, did you cut fat?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">You know, it\u2019s interesting. We, as you know, like sometimes\u2014sometimes I think that because we don\u2019t announce targets in advance, that people misunderstand a bit about the way we run the business. So we view this as a very thoughtful exercise. We don\u2019t feel like we\u2019ve sacrificed any optionality. We certainly have not sacrificed any commitment to our clients. These exercises are done at the business level and built up from the business level.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">All right, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thanks, Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Good morning. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Morning, Guy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I just wanted to return first of all to the capital management question and maybe ask it a little bit differently in terms of what we might expect over the next several quarters. So you bumped up the buyback to $1.7 billion, the diluted share count fell by about 2% in the quarter. If you annualize, then you\u2019re two or three percentage points ahead of what the kind of last five years\u2019 run rate has been in terms of how you\u2019ve reduced the diluted share count. So in the absence of a specific guide post-CCAR, what should we be thinking about in terms of that attempt to reduce the share count? Should we be thinking in terms of that 5% run rate, or maybe a couple of percentage points higher in line with what you\u2019ve done recently?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I think the reluctance for me to be more specific in terms of guiding you really reflects the dynamic nature of how we do it. So you have to think about\u2014and it\u2019s obviously more complicated than this, but you have to think about the three competing factors that we\u2019re always managing. The first and most important is that we put ourselves in a very strong financial position so that we\u2019re there for our clients, so if we saw a big uptick in client demand for our capital, we would be very happy to deploy that capital and actually not return it to shareholders. So this really reflects the fact that the client demand of a period of time hasn\u2019t been there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Now, the second things we do and the strength of the financial footings of the firm, obviously you\u2019ve seen us do a huge amount of work and you see it reflected in our ratios with 13.7 standardized at the end of this quarter. Obviously we\u2019ve been very focused on how we\u2019ve been de-risking the firm and deploying that capital when demanded for us. Ultimately, that gives you the flexibility to either return it or not, and that\u2019s why you\u2019ve seen the uptick over the past couple of years in terms of levels of activity. But the average diluted share count, as you pointed, is at a low level.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay, that\u2019s actually useful in terms of understanding your overall framework, so thanks for that. This actually turns out to be a related question - you caveated in the release that the environment for FICC continues to be pretty challenging because of low rates and volumes and low client activity, which implies that there is a more normal run rate that you think is achievable. Can you give us a sense of what that might be, and does that take into account revenue pressures from shifts to electronic trading as well as alternatively the potential to gain share from global competitors who may be retrenching?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So I\u2019ll make a couple of comments on that. You know, Guy, I\u2019d say that first in terms of client activity levels and run rate, if you will, run rate is a difficult thing but I don\u2019t think anyone would disagree that when you look at the trading activity levels and the industry trends over the last couple years, obviously they\u2019ve been in decline. When you look at the factors in terms of our clients and what they need, our clients are still there and they still need those services, they need them from us, and so the type of environment we\u2019ve been in, if you actually look at the sort of\u2014for lack of better language, the violence of the first quarter in January and February, and then the concerns about Brexit in the second quarter, I think it\u2019s fair for us to say these feel like low levels\u2014these are the type of factors that contribute to reduced client sentiment, reduced confidence, and as a result reduced activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Now, one interesting takeaway, and we\u2019ve seen this before sporadically, is after Brexit when volumes were much higher for those couple of days, in all the things that we watch, we could see a demonstrable uptick in our market shares. That may be the result of the current competitive environment as we\u2019ve talked about a number of the global competitors are going through restructurings, they\u2019ve been quite challenged. So when volumes pick up, we feel like we see it, but it\u2019s difficult for me to tell you what the run rate will be over a long period of time, given the dynamic nature of markets and the unique place we find ourselves with respect to global growth and interest rates. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So can you elaborate a little bit on those metrics, even though I recognize it was just for a short period of time, but the metrics that told you that you were picking up market share, because up until now when we\u2019ve asked you that question, you\u2019ve generally said it\u2019s still hard to measure, it\u2019s early days, you\u2019re not really going to be able to tell in this kind of environment. But you sound much more concrete about it now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes. One of the things that we\u2019re able to do over time, given all of the public regulatory reporting, is we\u2019re able to monitor those things more closely in fixed income than historically exists, and obviously you have exchanges that you can monitor. Exchange volumes are not necessarily the greatest indicator, but over long periods of time you can see it, or under unique circumstances when you get big spikes in activity. But it feels like it to us, Guy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question is from the line of Fiona Swaffield with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Fiona Swaffield</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Hi, I have questions in two areas. Firstly, I think you made some comments about security services and margins and volumes being somewhat down. I wonder if you could go into that in more detail, and are we\u2014historically we\u2019ve seen wider spreads, this is kind of a real change in trend. The second question was on your clients. In a recent presentation, Goldman talked about a mix shift in clients, or stronger growth among some clients versus others over 2015, going back. I mean, has there been a continued shift change if you looked at the client mix in 2016? Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes, thanks Fiona. So with respect to [indiscernible] client services, that\u2019s just reflective of activity levels, and as markets were volatile in the first and second quarter, you saw that translate through with respect to demand, market prices and spreads, so there\u2019s nothing really to highlight there other than its reflective of the environment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">In terms of the client base and our client footings, we\u2019re always looking to grow our market share across all segments, across all regions, and so we continue to focus on that and there\u2019s always things we can do better. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Thanks Fiona.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question is from the line of Kian Abouhossein with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kian Abouhossein</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes, hi. First question\u2014</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Kian, are you there? Kian, I think we lost you. I don\u2019t know if you can hear us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Kian, maybe your line has been placed on mute? Okay, we\u2019ll move onto the next question, and that\u2019s from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Hey, good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Good morning, Jim.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Just a couple of quick small questions. On FICC, you guys mentioned that mortgages were down significantly. None of your peers really talked about that. Is there anything unusual there for you guys in mortgage that hurt you in the quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">No, I think that\u2019s maybe just reflective of different product lines that businesses may have. We\u2019re not as big in things like credit cards and other parts of things which may flow through those business lines. I don\u2019t really have the visibility into the competitor base well enough to tell you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">But why was mortgages so much weaker than a year ago? I\u2019m just trying to think through the dynamic there this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Client activities and inventory, in terms of the way it moved year over year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Right, okay. Maybe I missed it - did you give us the fully phased in ratios?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">No, I didn\u2019t. So you want me to [indiscernible] for you, so just to recap again, I\u2019ll start with the advanced. Transitional 12:2, the fully phased is 11:8, standardized 13:7, fully phased 13:1.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay, so those gaps are closing as you kind of sell down the private equity, so that\u2019s progressing nicely. Okay, great. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question is from the line of Kian Abouhossein with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Welcome back, Kian.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kian Abouhossein</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes, sorry. I got disconnected somehow. Just briefly on Brexit, and I really have two questions. The first one is related to clearly we had the sell-off, high volatility, a lot of transaction volumes as you indicated in FX, et cetera. Historically after such an environment, we\u2019ve seen more of a dry-up of the business. Is that something that you\u2019re seeing, or do you see more seasonal adjustments to the business as you see in normal times, or is there a more pronounced adjustment to the business environment transaction volumes is getting a bit lower than usual what you would expect?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes, I think that\u2019s a reasonable question in terms of just the unique nature of Brexit. It\u2019s interesting how the world\u2014so the market reaction, the activity level right around Brexit obviously I don\u2019t think was surprising to any of us. I think you could have sat there those couple days after Brexit and if you were forecasting the next month of activity, I think you might have been surprised if we could have known in advance that equity markets would rebound so strongly, there would be a rebound in currencies, and the world would sort of normalize. I think that may be a little bit different, to go back to the core of your question about things we\u2019ve seen in the past, so this normalization was so quick that it actually may be something that\u2019s a better harbinger in the near term usually following one of these events for activity levels. I can frame that for you in a bit more detail.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So I talked about the merger business earlier. If we stay in this low growth environment, unless something is really uniquely impacted by Brexit and if the negotiation process takes a long period of time, then as I said, our bankers don\u2019t necessarily see this being a headwind. If we stay in this low interest rate environment and you take a look at our asset management business, then this is really an environment where clients need advice, and that also translates into our ITS business. This is a very content-rich environment now and markets have stabilized so quickly, whether it\u2019s debt or equity, et cetera, that I don\u2019t know if I would have guessed a couple of weeks ago that the market would have rebounded so quickly, but it feels pretty normalized for now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kian Abouhossein</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">The [indiscernible] that you underlined, do you see that already so far planning out?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Well, I think there would have been a lot of questions a few weeks ago about the cross-border mergers, for example, into the U.K., and obviously we\u2019ve seen that within two weeks, so I think there\u2019s evidence.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kian Abouhossein</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. The second question on Brexit is I think there was an earlier question about the impact of Brexit on you, but clearly there\u2019s this issue of EU passporting and there\u2019s clearly the potential of using [indiscernible] Article 4647 assuming there is no EU passporting. Is that something that you feel as a European player sitting in the U.K. you would be able to use to your benefit, or is that not strong enough of a regulatory setting in order to operate out of the U.K.?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I think the answer is it\u2019s just too early to tell in terms of how this process was going to unfold. Again as I said earlier, like everyone else, yourself included, we\u2019re hopeful that this is a really thoughtful and prudent process, but it really is a question\u2014you know, we\u2019re contingency planners and so we\u2019ll contingency plan for multiple outcomes, but way too early to speak specifically. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kian Abouhossein</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay, thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thanks Kian.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thanks, good morning. How are you doing, Harvey?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Good.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">A quick one on NII. I think when you were walking through INL, you said that NII was around $250 million or so, so if we\u2019re run rating that at about $1 billion, when we look at your INL balance sheet in the Q and just using the last quarter\u2019s numbers because I doubt they\u2019re that different, if we sum up the debt and loans, you get to about $70 billion or so, just over, which is a little over a 1% net yield. Is it that funding costs for that portfolio are really high? What causes that, or is it that the asset yields are low? What causes that yield to seem a bit low to folks?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So that\u2019s a good question. So let\u2019s start with\u2014why don\u2019t I just level set you on the balance sheet, the INL balance sheet first. So you were very accurate in your high level commentary, but the balance sheet is down roughly $2 billion quarter over quarter, down to 97.1, and that breaks out between roughly $20.8 billion of what we call equity, and of that $3.5 billion is public equity and the total $16.8 billion of corporate equity, and then the rest, as you said, is debt. With respect to the NIM, in part it has to do with deposits but for the most part it has to do with the quality of the portfolio. So as you know, a large portion of the portfolio is collateralized, so it\u2019s just less risky.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So it\u2019s more on the asset side rather than on the funding side.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">It\u2019s a mix. We don\u2019t have branches all over the United States, so we don\u2019t have the lowest marginal cost of funding in terms of deposits, but it really is more of the collateralized nature of the lending that we\u2019re doing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Got it, that helps. Thanks Harvey. Then one question on capital post-CCAR here. We in the past have gotten the dividend increase in the first quarter for you guys post-CCAR. I believe you mentioned in your press release post-CCAR that you were approved for a dividend hike, so was the difference this year just around timing with the Board not having time to meet before the third quarter dividend got announced, or should we think about this CCAR year differently than past years? </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I think what we intended to communicate was that the approval gave us the flexibility to do all those things, but we weren\u2019t speaking specifically to any decision making with respect to the dividend. The way we\u2014as you know, our preferred methodology, because it gives us a lot more flexibility internally how we manage our capital, is to provide capital return to shareholders, but there\u2019s nothing specific or you shouldn\u2019t interpret anything as a takeaway year to year as we think about the dividend. Those will be discrete decisions that we make as we think through the capital planning process.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay, thanks Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Hi, good morning. </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Morning Steven. How are you?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Well, thanks. So Harvey, first question I have is on CCAR. You noted in the past that CCAR is the firm\u2019s binding constraint on capital, and I\u2019m just wondering whether the favorable result in the latest exam positions you to maybe attribute or allocate less capital to market making activities; or said a bit differently, does it enable you to be more competitive on pricing assuming that your attributable equity has come down? </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes, so it\u2019s an interesting question. I guess you could say CCAR is binding if you ask of capital return and you have to revise it. That\u2019s not necessarily what we\u2019ve meant to communicate. Obviously if you just looked at our headline ratios at 13:7 and 12:2, we have significant excess capital relative to the required regulatory minimum. It\u2019s a dynamic process for us, and so in this particular year the Federal Reserve\u2019s interpretation of their scenario was more favorable than our interpretation of the scenario, but it\u2019s our interpretation of the scenario that\u2019s going to govern our capital policy and how we think about capital management, so that\u2019s how we\u2019ll approach it. It\u2019s our test.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Got it, okay. So in thinking about capital allocation, should we look at your own submission as a way to infer how much capital you\u2019re allocating for certain activities, or is that not reasonable?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes, except for the fact that\u2014the one thing I would say is that the capital allocation process itself, and now we\u2019re talking about operating principles, we\u2019re not talking about tests, the operating principles, we design the firm, we manage the firm to be very flexible. So if there is client demand for capital in investment banking, we want to be in a position to deploy that. If there\u2019s client demand for capital\u2014because the vast majority of our capital is high velocity. If there are opportunities and client demand in investing and lending, which tend to be longer term commitments of capital, obviously we engage in those also, but we don\u2019t allocate down a capital in a way that says, okay, here\u2019s your capital Mr. and Mrs. Business, you use that, we\u2019ll see you in a year. We feel like we get a much better ability to deliver to our clients globally if we can be more flexible and dynamic with it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Right, thanks Harvey. Just one more follow-up from me. There was a senior regulator who recently made remarks suggesting that they could impose some tougher capital requirements for activities specifically in the physical commodities space. I know that\u2019s been debated for some time, but do you have any sense as to what form that proposal might take and whether it could compel any changes in terms of how you strategically manage that business?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">No, we\u2019ll have to see what the rule comes out with. The vast majority of our business, as you know, is not unlike a lot of the other capital markets businesses where we\u2019re working with corporate clients on hedging their exposures, we\u2019re working with investors who want access to the commodity markets. So commodity hedging for a consumer or a producer of a commodity, to them it\u2019s no different than the way a corporate would hedge foreign exchange. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">We\u2019ll have to see what ultimately the rules look like, but obviously we\u2019re very committed to those clients.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Thanks Harvey. Do you have any sense as to timing as to when we\u2019ll get clarity on that rule?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">No, I only have the same information you have.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Fair enough. All right, Harvey. Thanks for taking my questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question is from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Good morning, Harvey. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple of quick follow-ups. First of all, in terms of the additional global core liquidity you had on the balance sheet at both the end of the quarter and for the average of the quarter, that was up a bit from last quarter. Is that primarily due to the GE deposits, or is there something else going on there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">No, that\u2019s correct. We took in $16 billion roughly of deposits, and that\u2019s really the whole driver of the increase, both in the balance sheet and in the GCLA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay, fair enough. Then just in terms of the backlog decline both sequentially and year over year, is there any specific geography - you know, Asia, Europe, North AmericA - that is meaningfully stronger or weaker within that trend?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">No, not necessarily. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay, that\u2019s it for me. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question is from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Thanks very much. Harvey, just to circle back to the expense commentary for a moment, would it be your expectation that the actions you\u2019ve taken will allow you to generate positive operating leverage, or maybe just more broadly, what is your expectation about operating leverage for the back half of this year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Look, you\u2019ve seen it - it seems like ages ago now, but in the first quarter of 2015, we had an improved market environment, we were very quickly able to deliver lots of operating leverage, and you saw a near 15% ROE in that quarter. Like I said, it feels like a long time ago now. We continually review all the businesses to ensure that we\u2019re maintaining the right footprint, so this is all about making sure that we find the right balance between our commitment to clients over the long term and expense management, and obviously the first half of this year has not been the greatest environment, so you\u2019re just seeing us respond to it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Can you just help me understand - when you say $700 million of run rate savings, from what level and under what revenue circumstances?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So the way to think about that is, if we finish the end of the 2015 with a certain [indiscernible], all those adjustments and resources on a run rate basis would be $700 million, so all other factors being equal. But that won\u2019t translate into this year because there are severance and other related costs, and net of that will be something more like 350, so you should really think of that as translating into 2017. Now, this will be dynamic of course because we\u2019ll be hiring more people, so you and I are really sterilizing the discussion for this number, but I think that\u2019s the best way to explain it to you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">It sounds like you think that the actions you\u2019ve taken are sufficient to address this current revenue circumstance, but what would cause you perhaps reconsider and make additional adjustments?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Well certainly if the environment continued to be challenged, we would continue to refine the businesses. On the flipside, if the environment globally improved dramatically and there was a real demand for our resources, which has been no difficulty in attracting very, very high quality talent to the firm, so we\u2019re also being very thoughtful about giving people an opportunity to want to be at Goldman Sachs that we want to be here.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Great. Then just one quick accounting question. I think last quarter you indicated that your expected tax rate for the full year would be around 31%. Has that changed at all, given the second quarter\u2019s figure?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yes, given where we\u2019re running now, I would say something just shy of 30 feels like a better expectation where we stand right now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Great. Thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin Ryan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Hey, good morning Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Good morning, Devin.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin Ryan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I appreciate the update on the digital consumer finance business initiative, understand the current view that this is going to be a slow build. It sounds like it could take some time to really move the needle under the current path, but is there a case for buying something to enhance either the lending capabilities or liability gathering, just so that you get to that critical mass more quickly, or just thinking about the strategy, is it just kind of by its nature it needs to be built up organically, just so that it\u2019s a differentiated platform?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yes, it\u2019s a good question. So obviously you\u2019ve seen us do a number of smaller bolt-on acquisitions in IMD, and the thesis behind those, because we\u2019re certainly not reluctant to do that, is when we feel like we had a capability that we would\u2014if there\u2019s a service we\u2019d like to enhance for our clients or a capability that we\u2019re quite good at, that we think we can add scale to, we\u2019ll just weigh the costs and benefits of acquiring versus building in-house. </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">This particular effort, when we looked at it, we really felt like best designed from scratch, and the reason for that is I think we\u2019re kind of uniquely positioned. It allows us to leverage our technology skills and our risk skills, but this is really about if you look at sort of the competitive landscape, there are benefits that online lending platforms provide to consumers and there are benefits that large commercial providers of credit provide to consumers. We\u2019re just really looking to bridge the gap between those strengths and offer consumers as best we can a really thoughtful and differentiated product.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin Ryan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Got it, that\u2019s very helpful. Separately, just love some thoughts about how you guys are thinking about the upcoming election just as an influence on business, either from a client perspective or even how you\u2019re thinking about planning in your business. There\u2019s been a lot of rhetoric just around some pretty bold proposals recently, reinstating Glass-Steagall, for example in financials, some similar kind of bold themes in other sectors. I\u2019m just curious how much is this uncertainty into the election delaying decision-making, if at all, or keeping a lid on client activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Look, I think this cycle will have its unique aspects to it versus other presidential cycles, but historically there\u2019s always been some element which may have ultimately deferred a decision that a client might make to a later period. But these are short term in nature, so we don\u2019t see any significant impact in terms of the near term.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin Ryan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Got it, okay. Just last one quickly - the decline in VAR, I know that can bounce around, but was that just de-risking into the U.K. referendum or just the reduced volatility? Just curious what drove that - it was at the lowest level in quite some time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">It was a combination. Obviously the VAR declined pretty meaningfully in average over the quarter. Really, that was a combination of two factors. There was reduced client activity going into Brexit, and as I mentioned earlier, we were being pretty prudent as we approached the date.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin Ryan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Understood, got it. Thanks Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question is from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thanks. Harvey, I wanted to go back into the CCAR and think about adjustments on operational risk. Like we had talked about, there had been some double counting. You did get a benefit of 250 basis points, so to speak, in your minimum ratios going higher. Is that\u2014you know, as we talked about double counting and SIFI possibly going into CCAR, it looks like you got a break on operational risk that almost equals your SIFI charge almost exactly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">We don\u2019t have any visibility into those calculations, Marty. As you know, there\u2019s no transparency in that process, so I really can\u2019t comment. I think this year\u2019s test and last year\u2019s test and the year prior to that, I think it just confirms what the Federal Reserve has been very clear about. Their test is going to be dynamic from year to year. They\u2019re going to incorporate lots of different variables - that\u2019s how they designed it, so I actually think they\u2019re just fulfilling their design criteria.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">The other thing I was going to ask you was on this quarter and the headcount reductions, where the severance costs would probably hit, when you look at kind of dividing it, if you just said well, you\u2019re at full run rate in the second quarter, which I know you probably weren\u2019t, but $175 million per quarter, and then you look at the net for the year you\u2019re talking about for this year of being 350 net severance then being possible $350 million, I was trying to think of the timing in relation to the gains in the sense of the expense savings and how that might have affected the second quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yes, so the way to think about it is on an annualized basis, Marty, so you should incorporate those numbers as $700 million on a run rate basis, that run rate basis\u2014and this is again a very sterilized way we\u2019re doing this conversation. That\u2019s all other factors being equal going into 2017, and this year that will translate roughly into $350 million of savings this year. How that flows through quarter to quarter, that\u2019s very specific to a number of circumstances. </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Would it be safe to say that a majority of the severance was going to be at least in the second quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Some, but not all. </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Hey, morning Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Hey Brian.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I just had a quick question on the Volcker investments. I know you said previously that there is a chance that it could get extended as you get into 2017, but there\u2019s really been no discussion as far as I\u2019ve seen with regards to that. So how should we think about those Volcker investments over the course of next year? Is it really just some type of liquidity event in 2Q17 that will become or happen because if there is no extension or you\u2019re just going to take a wait-and-see approach on winding those down?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So as I mentioned before, we have $4.3 billion that\u2019s private, $2.1 billion\u2014I went through the waterfall, so I won\u2019t do it again. You would have seen a communication from the regulators that basically spoke to the confirmation of the extension to 2017, and then there\u2019s been public submissions in terms of industry-wide requests for incremental extensions, which I believe under the Volcker interpretations can be as much as an incremental five years. </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">If you remember, if you go back to the genesis of Volcker, it wasn\u2019t designed to force fire sales or anything like that, so the industry again has been working with the regulators through various bodies, and we\u2019ll see how the regulators finally respond to that. But I think the industry has done a good job, as have we, of bringing down these levels, but we\u2019re sitting alongside our clients mostly in these funds, so we don\u2019t have unilateral authority just to sell these assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay, good. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">That\u2019s great. Since there aren\u2019t any more questions, we just want to thank everybody for joining the call. Hopefully we\u2019ll all get to see you over the course of the coming months. If you have any other questions, give a call into Dane and the team; but otherwise thanks again for participating and have a great summer. </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs second quarter 2016 earnings conference call.

(NYSE:<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GS\" title=\"Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\">GS</a>)</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Q3 2016 Earnings Conference Call</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">October 18, 2016, 09:30 AM ET</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Executives</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Dane Holmes - IR</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Harvey Schwartz - EVP &amp; CFO</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Analysts</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Mike Mayo - CLSA</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Fiona Swaffield - RBC</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Jim Mitchell - The Buckingham Research</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Brennan Hawken - UBS</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Steven Chubak - Nomura Securities</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Devin Ryan - JMP Securities</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Brian Kleinhanzl - KBW</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning. My name is Dennis, and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today, October 18, 2016.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you. Mr. Holmes, you may begin your conference.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Dane Holmes</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm's belief regarding future events that, by their nature are uncertain and outside of the firm's control. The firm's actual results and financial condition may differ possibly materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm's future results, please see the description of Risk Factors in our current annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, global core liquid assets and supplementary leverage ratio and you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that's posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">This audio cast is copyrighted material to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent. Our Chief Financial Officer, Harvey Schwartz, will now review the firm's results. Harvey?</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thanks Dane and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I'll walk you through the third quarter and year-to-date results and am happy to answer any questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Net revenues were $8.2 billion, net earnings $2.1 billion. Earnings per diluted share $4.88 and our annualized return on common equity was 11.2%. For the year-to-date, net revenues were $22.4 billion, net earnings $5.1 billion, earnings per diluted share $11.24 and our annualized return on common equity was 8.7%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Relative to the first quarter of this year, the second and now the third quarter, have shown steady improvement. This improvement is reflected in third-quarter revenues, which increased 19% year-over-year. We also had a modest sequential increase which is particularly noteworthy given the third quarter is often seasonally slower.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">A few factors contributed to the enhanced operating environment. The markets generally improved with equity prices steadily moving higher. The S&amp;P 500 was up 3.3% in the third quarter. The MSCI World increased by 4.8% and the VIX declined by 15%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Credit spreads also tightened during the quarter with U.S. investment grade and high yield cash spreads tighter by 12 basis points and 87 basis points respectively. In addition, there weren't any major changes to the global economic outlook over the course of the quarter. For example consensus estimates for global GDP growth remained roughly consistent.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Ultimately a more favorable backdrop and improved client sentiment translated into year-over-year revenue growth in three of our four business segments. Now let's discuss them.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Investment banking produced third quarter revenues of $1.5 billion, 14% lower than a strong second quarter. Although revenues declined sequentially, our investment banking backlog remained robust and was up versus last quarter. Breaking down the components of investment banking in the quarter, advisory revenues were $658 million down 17% compared to the second quarter as industry-wide completed activity declined.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Year-to-date Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced and completed M&amp;A. We advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the third quarter, including ARM holdings \u00a324.4 billion sale to Softbank Group. AGL Resources $12 billion merger with Southern Company and Lockheed Martin's $5 billion spinoff and merger of its IS&amp;GS business into Leidos.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We also advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the third quarter, including WhiteWave Foods $12.5 billion sale to Group Danone. Hewlett-Packard Enterprises' $8.8 billion spin off and merger of non-core software assets with Micro Focus International and Abbott Medical Optics' $4.3 billion sale to Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Moving down to revenue, revenues were $879 million in the third quarter, down 11% sequentially, due to a decline in both debt and equity underwriting. Equity underwriting revenues were $227 million down 16% compared to the second quarter due to a continued weak backdrop for equity issuance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">However the end of the quarter was significantly more active in the beginning with more than half of the quarter's IPO volume occurring in September. Debt underwriting revenues of $652 million were down 10% quarter-over-quarter, following a robust second quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">For the first nine months of the year debt amortizing produced record year-to-date results. During the third quarter, we actively supported our client's financing needs, participating in Postal Savings Bank of China's $7.4 billion IPO, Great Plains Energy's $2.5 billion follow-on and convertible offering to support its purchase of Westar and Fortis' $2 billion investment grade offering for the purchase of ITC.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our FICC and equities businesses, net revenues were $3.7 billion in the third quarter up 2%compared to the second quarter. FICC client execution net revenues were $2 billion in the third quarter up 2% sequentially.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Credit increased and benefited from strong primary issuance and tighter spreads. Mortgage also increased and included better market-making conditions even tighter spreads. Rates was down slightly as client activity was driven by the continued discussion around potential Central Bank actions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Currencies was essentially unchanged compared to the second quarter with lower client activity, particularly post the Brexit vote and commodities declined during the quarter as activity remained light. In equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees and security services, net revenues for the third quarter were $1.8 billion up 2% quarter-over-quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Equities client execution net revenues of $678 million were up 16% sequentially, reflecting better market-making conditions. Commissions and fees were $719 million, down 3% quarter-over-quarter. Security services generated net revenues of $387 million down 8% relative to the seasonally stronger second quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Turning to risk, average daily volume in the third quarter declined to $57 million, down $5 million sequentially. Moving on to our investing and lending activities, collectively these businesses produced net revenues of $1.4 billion in the third quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of $920 million, reflecting company-specific events, sale and gains in public equity investments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $478 million and included approximately $275 million of net interest income. Investment management we reported third-quarter net revenues of $1.5 billion up 10% from the second quarter as incentive fees, management fees and transaction revenues all increased.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Assets under supervision increased $37 billion sequentially to a record $1.35 trillion. The increase was due to net market appreciation and net inflows. Long-term fee-based net inflows of $14 billion were primarily driven by fixed-income products.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Now let me turn to expenses, year-to-date compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior your equity awards and other items such as benefits declined by 13%. This was roughly in line with net revenues.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">The 13% year-to-date decline results in a compensation to net revenues ratio of 41%. This is a hundred basis points lower in the funds accrual in the first half of this year. Third-quarter noncompetition expenses were $2.1 billion down slightly compared to the second quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Now I would like to take you through a few key statistics. Total staff was approximately 34,900 roughly flat with the second quarter. Our effective tax rate for the year-to-date was 26.9%. Our global core liquid asset ended the third quarter at $214 billion and our balance sheet was $880 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14% using the standardized approach. It was 12.4% under the Basel 3 advanced approach. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 6.3%. In the quarter we repurchased 7.8 million shares for $1.3 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In terms of capital, our ratios have significantly strengthened over the last several years. This reflects the transformation of our balance sheet and our cumulative effort to de-risk the firm. All of these actions, combined with more than $30 billion of earnings since 2011, position the firm to grow our capital ratios and simultaneously bring our basic share count to its lowest point ever.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Before I wrap up, I want to cover three topics, our client franchise, expense initiatives and new opportunities. With respect to global client franchise, it's in great shape. We have a strong position in each of our four segments, investment banking, institutional client services, investing in lending and investment management.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">While many of our clients are currently challenged by the low growth environment, we are committed to partnering with them and they look to navigate these headwinds. On expenses, last quarter we discussed the $700 million savings initiative that we undertook in the first half of the year and we continue to look at additional means of improving our efficiency without impacting our global client franchise.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Focusing on operating efficiency, not only positions us for margin expansion in better environments, but it also provides additional benefits. It allows the firm to maintain its global footprint and to continue to invest in the future, which is an essential component of sustainable value creation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">While there are currently economic headwinds in several countries globally, our focus on efficiency across all of our businesses and regions allows the firm not only to maintain, but also to invest in our client franchise through the cycle. Additionally, our expense discipline allows us to invest in new opportunities. Last week we launched a new online personal loan platform Marcus by Goldman Sachs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Marcus' goal is to enter the consumer credit market and provide a product that is simple, transparent, flexible and provides consumers with real value. Like any new effort, we are taking a slow and methodical approach with Marcus. We are leveraging all the firm's pre-existing strengths across risk management and technology and we have brought an experienced team of consumer lending professionals to drive Marcus forward led by Harit Talwar.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Before taking your questions, I would like to leave you with one thought. The firm is as focused on navigating today's environment, as we are on preparing for the future. You have to do the first really well to be in a position to do the latter. Thanks again for dialing in and I am happy to answer your questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p4\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Hi thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Hey, good morning, Glenn.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">So I appreciate the color around things related to FICC and I've a question of overall backdrop. In the first quarter of '15, the Swiss re-pegged stuff went bonkers for a couple weeks and you made tons of money even more than the overall industry. This quarter it didn't seem like there was too many aha moment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Credit spreads tightened and they had aftermath of Brexit and stuff, but in your text you point out low rates and slow economic growth as headwinds for FICC. You talk about lower market firms and volatility and equities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">I'm just curious when you look at the quarter we just had in FICC particularly, is it more like you had a nice pickup like first quarter of '15 and you're setting this up for keep calm like things have returned back to normal or is this possibly a little bit higher activity environment given the uncertainty?</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">So it's a great question, year-over-year we were up 49% on a core basis. I think in some respects that speaks to a weaker third quarter environment last year, but I have to agree with you. I wouldn't say it was a particularly strong quarter for FICC. Year-over-year I talked about some of the drivers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">I would say maybe the best way to describe, it wasn't so much -- it wasn't so much about tailwind as it was about not having so many headwinds in the quarter and of course we translated nicely for us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">I'll take it if it will get a little bit higher operating environment. One last one on I&amp;L, it's interesting that multiples -- take up multiples were near their highs and you would expect a lot of exits. This one happened to be a better quarter. You talked about some company-specific events, some sales and the up markets, but I guess the question is, is are you finding opportunities that will also put money to work especially on the equity side.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">I saw the UFC deal and I am a huge Conor McGregor fan, but that was close to six times, the six times cap. So curious about how you see the investing environment for I&amp;L?</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">So the opportunities for a while have been more on the debt side. You've seen the I&amp;L balance sheet transition. When you see it again this quarter it is going to close to 80% debt, but selectively we're certainly seeing opportunities whether they be in what we recall other forms of equity, real estate or other areas, but selectively we've seen some good opportunities in corporate equity. As you're probably seeing, we're in a market now raising a fund, and the reception to that has been quite strong.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">How big is the I&amp;L balance sheet now? You said its 80% Fixed Income, but it's over 100 now?</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">So just to give you the exact number, it's 98.9 billion, [indiscernible] just under 99 billion, and that's up $1.8 billion quarter-over-quarter. And I said almost 80%. It's 78% really debt and other assets, which leaves you basically with $21.5 billion of what we would categorize as equity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">All right. Awesome. Thanks. Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Sure. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Your next question is from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Good morning Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Hey Christian.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">So a question on your consumer lending efforts, given the firm will be facing a very different demographic than you have historically faced, may we just talk about how you think about reputational risks and how you mitigate it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Yes, so it's a great question. So I think the short answer is providing value to the consumer. So one of the reasons we have said so many times and this is going to be a very deliberate and methodical approach and a bit of crawl before we walk in this business is because we're well aware that this is a new effort for us. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Now and some of this is not new for us, our technology skills, the risk management, but the interface through the technology with this new important client base, it's a different space for us. So we've hired, obviously, people with decades of experience. But I think the greatest mitigating factor is slow growth, monitoring it very closely. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">But also, when we put this together, we took input from consumers, and it really is, I don't know if it's the first-ever, but it\u2019s really is a lending product that is driven by consumer input. And so that means providing them with flexibility, with real value, with simplicity. And that's why we've come out with something, and we got feedback, consumers don't necessarily like and they don't understand the fee structures. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So we created a no-fee product, no small print. If you call our call centers, people pick up. Some of these things are simple, but they're quite important in terms of what consumers want. And if you deliver what consumers want and you really control your processes, then obviously, you create value and you deliver what regulators want also.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Okay. That's helpful. And then just a cleanup question. On the buyback, $1.2 billion in the quarter, which is a bit lower than the first half run rate. I know the last CCAR cycle buybacks were back-end weighted. How should we think about the pace for this cycle?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So you're right. A year ago, there were some [indiscernible] that attach, which led to more backend weighted profile. This year, we had a bit of flexibility in terms of how we'll approach the next couple of quarters, but a lot of this i6s going to be driven by edging out the environment and demand for the balance sheet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We would really like to start putting our capital to work if the environment improved from where it is today. But certainly, there's some flexibility in the profile for us to go up a little bit from these levels. But again, certainly not committing to that. You know how we think about capital management, and share repurchase for us is not to be equated with dividends and so it's going to be dynamic.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Okay, thank you Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Thanks Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Hi, Mike</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Can you just first, question on capital ratios. Your ratio continues to improve. Based on we had some recent comments by [indiscernible] and where CCAR is heading into '18, did anything change in how you managed through that process?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">And then just with your last comments on the last question on balancing buybacks versus investments, are you starting to see some opportunities to make investments? And maybe it's because of market share opportunities globally but just wanted to get your thoughts on that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So again, on the ratios, as I mentioned, 14 under standardized and 12 4 are advanced. By the way, just [indiscernible] and I'll know I get the question Mike, its 13.4 standardized fully phased and 11 9 on the advanced fully phased. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">In terms of the stress testing, white paper and govern it relates comments I'd say at a high level, obviously, they put a ton of work into this with various constituencies. We \u2013 our initial frameworks were their framework seem quite awful. And it seems somewhat consistent with the way we actually manage the firm. So we manage the firm obviously on the forward-looking basis in terms of how we stress tests. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We obviously also manage the spot capital ratios. And under our spot capital ratios, as you can see, we have lots of capacity. And so we'll have to see ultimately the details in the MPR, but again, they did the right thing here by giving the bank the opportunity to make adjustments because as you know, this won't be incorporated into the 2017 cycle. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">And so the extent to which firms need to adapt, will be able to adapt after we see the MPR. But I think our starting point puts us in a great position and again the treatment of share repurchase and we'll see what happens with balance sheet and other things. But we'll take our normal approach in terms of capital management from here. But it seems like the right direction.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on I&amp;L. When you look at some of the things that the Fed has put out there on physical commodities and some of the pressures on that part of the market versus what you guys have been doing on the debt side, just where do you see the outlook based on maybe some of these potential changes, the increase in RWAs? And what you can still grow versus what could potentially be at risk?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So that's a great question. In terms of why we just talked about commodities MPR. So the market's been waiting for this for a while. As you know, we've been in the commodity business for decades, and we think it's really important that the Federal Reserve\u2019s taken the lead here in terms of an important area of focus for us in the industry, but especially as it relates to ultimately establishing uniform standards across the industry. So we welcome all that. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">With respect to our business, we've obviously been very vocal in our commitment to the commodity business, and some of that I think maybe that gets misunderstood. So I want to underscore for you a bit. What we're committed to is serving our clients and their needs and you kind unpack that a bit and simplify by saying there's really three activities that are critical to our clients. It's critical for them to hedge, and that's consumers and producers would have commodity price exposure.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Financing of those businesses is critical. And then obviously, market-making activities, which provide liquidity to the markets under a critical component of making those markets function. That's what we're most committed to. You've seen over the years, we've been reducing on balance sheet, investing in commodities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">And so we'll work with the industry and with regulators like we would in any MPR process. But what we're more focused on ensuring that those services from a Goldman Sachs' perspective and across the industry can get provided to clients in a safe and cost-effective way. No different than if we were to approach any of the MPRs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay. Thanks a lot.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Thanks Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Hi Matt.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the targeted customer base for the [indiscernible] platform in terms of FICO scores, income or however you're defining it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Yes. So with this launch and with this one product, we're focused on the prime borrower base.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">And I guess, how do you define prime? I mean, it's a pretty big segment overall.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So we would define it broadly for you. Let's just say above 650 FICO category.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay. And then just over time, will you provide more disclosures on this? Because as I step back and look at some of the names I cover, there seems like it could be one of the meaningful new initiatives that's out there in terms of change in the profile the company a little bit, and I think more disclosures over time will be helpful to be able to track the performance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Sure. We're happy as it grows, obviously as it becomes more meaningful, I mean just to underscore this. I got an e-mail last that we booked our first loan. So if you want to continue, if you want to consider that continuous updating of financial disclosure, Matt, but I don't mean to make a lot of your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Obviously, as it grows and becomes more meaningful, we'll spend more time with you on it. I think the important thing now is that, we make sure that everyone understands the product, the pace we expect to move at, which will be very deliberate and slow. And that in terms of return for long term, if that's kind of where you're getting, obviously, I talked a lot bit about the consumer here but we built this business to be accretive in the long run to Goldman Sachs returns. But we're certain, we're happy to keep you updated.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. And then completely unrelated, any color on the regional performance within fixed income trading this quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">No. There was nothing specific that jumped out. It was really more across the products but it wasn't anything, particularly in the regional clouds.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay, all right. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Good morning, Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Hi in the past, you've mentioned that you felt some competitors were having a more permanent retreat from the market. Did you see some of the benefit of share gains this quarter as part of your capital markets revenue? And also your comp ratio was up 100 basis points year-over-year. Are you trying to hire more people or pay more in an effort to gain share?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So with respect to the market share, certainly over the course of the past year, I would say there's been periods, particularly things like some of our core strengths, Prime Brokerage in fixed income, across the regions, we've seen discrete shifts in market share. I would say when we look at it in terms of the core businesses, for example, like credit, as we monitor those market shares, certainly with certain client segments like asset managers, it feels like we're picking up market share. Again, one of the difficult things about market share is you really need volume to grow. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And even though obviously our performance this year significantly better than last year, it's the best quarter we've had in five quarters. You really need activity levels to pick up from here. Now just in terms in the second part of your question, the 41% of this 49 is our best estimate. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">We told you forever that as a conceptual matter, you should expect in periods where revenues should decline that compensation and benefits expense should lag that and obviously, we talked to you ton about operating leverage. And so as revenues grow, you should also expect compensation and benefits expects to lag that growth because of the operating leverage. But at this stage 41% an output.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And one follow-up. Brexit, is this a chance to gain additional share? Or is this just pain that everybody has to share? And do you think more business shifts to the U.S.?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">I would say that Brexit potentially is something that could drive share to the U.S. I think what we've witnessed over the last several years is U.S. firms like ourselves with really, really strong market shares and leading business positions whether you look at FICC, investment banking, equities, asset management, if you're a leader in a franchise throughout this cycle, particularly as activity picks up, I think there is share to gain. I think our European clients need us. But in terms of Brexit, I think it's unclear whether that's having any impact at this stage. It feels like early days.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">All right, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hi good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hi Betsy, how are you?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hi good. I just had a couple of questions. Looking at the VaR that you guys put out in your note obviously in the press release. It seems like volatility actually came down a bit in certain segments and yet the VaR came down as well. And I look at this and I'm thinking is there an opportunity for you to allocate a little bit more in this environment and continue to generate some nice sized trading revenues?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So I think that observation is correct. I think what's most important about that observation is just the capacity we have under the capital ratios, so obviously. But again, VaR is going to be driven by market volatilities and by client demand. And as client demand picks up or as market volatilities pickup, certainly you would expect that to translate through. We're not feeling constrained at all really only by the macro environment and our client appetite is same.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So in this past quarter it was more function of client demand pulling back because it feels like you have the capital capacity to have had more of allocated this past quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">When you look at it in terms of so you are talking about year-over-year sequentially and you look at -- sorry, my allergies [ph] are bad today. If you look at more sequentially it's kind of mix of our total level is coming down and what I'll call position changes. If you look at year-over-year it's more about position changes. I think your big point is this environment wasn\u2019t a particularly strong environment, again it's the third quarter it's got some of the seasonal characteristics.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yes. Okay. And then just secondly on Asia, could you give us a sense as to how you guys are reorienting your Asia franchise, I noticed that there was some headcount changes over there and some management changes, so could you give us a sense as to what the strategy is for that region?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So, as you remember from the last call, we talked about the expense initiatives we launched in the first half, which translated to $700 million run rate savings. Anything you are reading in a press is a bit distorted. This process in Asia it just a continuation of the process that has been ongoing for the rest of the firm. In terms of Asia completely committed to the region. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">They make sense. I'm just saying I think there is also a comment around the Head of Asia was changing and so wondered if there was a shift in focus on?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">No, they are completely unrelated events. If you're sitting at Magic Me [ph] yesterday you would have heard Mark talked about how we joined the firm in 1976 and he just thought this would be a perfect time for him. But now they are completely unrelated in terms of there is nothing strategic in that. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">All right. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Good morning, Guy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I wanted to follow-up on the I&amp;L questions. Specifically, maybe you can just give us some color, maybe some examples, of how you have been continuing feed the equity balances to offset the gains harvesting that you have been doing over the past couple of years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Because you've harvested quite a bit, and yet you have been able to maintain that asset line item in the $21 billion, $21.5 billion range. And in the context of that, maybe you can comment on some of the recent proposals or requests that the Fed has made for congressional action to tighten up.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So in terms of I&amp;L balance sheet, again you are right to point out that $21 billion, $21.5 billion have been relatively constant. Obviously, that from a smaller component of the balance sheet I mentioned before it's close to 8% and 8% is really lending another item. And so I don\u2019t have details in front of me to give you blow-by-blow breakdowns on where reinvestments are occurring. Obviously, corporate private equity has been slow over the last couple of years, but that $21.5 million 20% of that now is made up of real estate globally. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And so that's been a meaningful participant. Now why have you generally not seen the asset class going lower? Obviously it's about high class problem. The assets have been performing, the markets have been generally going up over the last couple of years and you've seen that performance as I&amp;L segment. So that's part of the gives and gets. In terms of I think you are -- I think -- I don\u2019t think you are much talking about brokers you are talking about the fed discussions with congress, very early days and we'll see how that evolves, is that your question?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yes, I think that there was some -- there was -- before the commodities NPR came out the fed had also I think made some noises about asking for congressional guidance I guess on cutting back on merchant banking that's allowed within broker.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And I was wondering if you had some sense of whether you would be able to continue to seed that equity line and keep it in the range that it's been in or grow it if in fact there're further restrictions on merchant banking.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Well, obviously the opportunity exist, we think we are providing an important layer of capital, but these conservations evolving, it's super early, so there'd be no way for us to interpret or give you any guidance on that. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Fair enough. I guess the other question, also I&amp;L-related is, and had this has to do with the negative operating leverage comment that you had made for the Firm broadly. So for the nine months, your revenues are down; your comp is down not as much, maybe a couple of percentage points differential, which is a negative operating leverage.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">But the biggest component of the revenue decline has been I&amp;L. My question is, if I&amp;L had declined in line with the rest of the Firm, would it be possible to keep the comp declining in line as well? In other words, would you have been able to maintain your margin better if it hadn't been I&amp;L that was driving the revenue down?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So on the competition benefit expense you are right, so revenues are down 15%, you relate any competition benefit expense down 13. Now I wouldn\u2019t -- maybe we characterize that as negative operating leverage I don\u2019t know that's meaningful negative operating leverage and the reason we are able to achieve that almost lock step decline, it was because of the expense initiative we launched in the beginning of the year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">In terms of contribution of an individual segment, we look at this as firm wide collective as we go through the competition process. And obviously competition as we repeated to you many times before, it's about performance, but it's also about managing the company for the long term and executing our strategy for the long term. So it's not going to be a -- a competition process not going to driven by one segment contribution one way or another. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate it. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Sure. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question is from the line of Fiona Swaffield with RBC. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Fiona Swaffield</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Hi.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Fiona Swaffield</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I just wanted to ask -- good morning. About pricing you mentioned -- we talked about market share, but have you seen given that some banks putting less capital to work than others, any impact on pricing in any of your products, and there is the follow-up as well on the tax rate now that is coming lower again what are you thinking about for the future? Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So in pricing at the margin it's very business specific, we have seen in some cases that I'll call a rational re-pricing and things like prime brokerage. But again in this low volume environment I don\u2019t know how much that you will see, in other words, the same low volume, low growth environment we have globally that's contributing to what it looks like in the future extraordinarily strong competitive environment for our businesses is the same thing that doesn\u2019t allow for lot of price improvements.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And so I think these one of your things where even though it has taken while you need environment that is challenge for a while or to get competitors retreats of the same challenges don\u2019t allow for price adjustments, it maybe overtime you see price adjustments, but certainly things the more capital intensive parts of the business like prime brokerage where we are market leader. In terms of tax I think in terms of your estimate obviously it will be driven by regional contributions, but I would say 28% to 29% that range. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Fiona Swaffield</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question from the line of Jim Mitchell with The Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Hey Jim. How are you?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Good. How are you doing, Harvey?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Good.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Maybe just a question on Asia I guess in a more positive way, you have the Hong Kong, Shanghai connect going into place later this year, it seems like when the Hong Kong Shanghai connect went in you guys had a nice boost in equity trading the industry did in the first half of 2015. Do you expect something similar this time around?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I don\u2019t know, necessarily we have a strong view in terms of the immediate. I do think that over the intermediate term it's an important development. I think more broadly, well it might not be a straight path to increasing volumes, I think more broadly in Asia our perspective is and with China that we are on a long upward trajectory of activity and our role and ability to work with clients in the region, whether its trading, advisory, capital raising, this just feels like a very long positive trajectory, but it\u2019s not going to be straight line.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Right okay. Fair enough. And then maybe a follow-up on the pipeline. You guys did note you're down year-over-year. Is that mostly M&amp;A and can you give any more color on what you're seeing in terms of the outlook on the pipeline?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So the pipeline feels pretty good when you talk our M&amp;A team. And the backlog sequentially was up, not down. But the activity levels that I mentioned in terms of completed transactions in the market, obviously down over year after very, very healthy levels.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">The best perspective I can share with you is the one I get from talking to our M&amp;A bankers. And it hasn\u2019t shifted much over the course of the year. The same fundamental factors that are contributing to the last two years of M&amp;A activity, generally low topline growth, a desire to drive efficiencies, access to the capital markets, all those factors still in place.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Now regionally the U.S. field is more active then Europe and Asia fields a bit more active than Europe, but I am giving you really very localized commentary. Long-term it feels like the fundamental factors are in place.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And the underwriting side of the equation?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So in underwriting as you saw, we've had very strong debt performance and we had a record for the first nine months of this year on a year-to-date basis. I mentioned before that half year IPO volume or meaningful portion of the IPO volume actually occurred in September.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So it does feel like we are starting now again into a market where a lot of that activity that got pushed from the first quarter into the second quarter that that still exists. So we feel reasonably good about activity levels in the capital markets on an intermediate basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. Great. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question is from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Chris Kotowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes, I wonder if you could give us some more color on the new private equity fund? I saw a press report saying it's between $5 billion and $8 billion. But if you could just comment on the targeted size and mandate? Is it global or North American? Is it pure corporate equity, or is it broader? And then as a follow-on to that, if it's $5 billion to $8 billion, the Blackstones and Apollos of the world are raising $18 billion-plus. So what's the strategy to put the money to work? Is it to go more middle market? To do fewer deals or to bring in more co-investors? Those kind of my questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">No I am happy to talk about it. I don't know if I'll get to all of your questions, but let me just give you the high level. So we are in the market, there is really two fundamental reasons why we decided to engage in the fund raise. One was really to have a full offering for our private wealth clients.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And the second is if you look at the capital regime particular under CCARs as it related to private equity, corporate equity specifically, those capital requirements continue to adjust. So they are giving us the flexibility to utilize the funds and to provide that to our clients. It seem like it made a ton of sense.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Now in terms of the fund size, we have been talking about $5 billion to $8 billion, that\u2019s what the team feels is the right size for the horizon that they are thinking about. So they are not looking the raise the largest one of the world despite the fact that there\u2019s been very significant interest in terms of how we are approaching it and in terms of its focus, its focus will be on corporate private equity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Chris Kotowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. And should we assume that you will commit 3% to it? And is it the standard asset management 1% and 20%? And I assume that these will show up on the asset management side? And then kind of related to that, is this all a wealth management, asset management, standalone business that's walled off from investment banking? Or can there be cross-pollination between the two?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Well the activities, the activities allow for us obviously to work with our investment bankers, but it is an asset management driven product and its broker compliance, in its design.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Chris Kotowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. All right. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Good morning. So first question on non-comp. I think you took a charge here in occupancy. Is there some benefit that we should see flowing through in subsequent quarters from that occupancy charge this quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes. So we took a $63 million charge. This relates to one asset that we leased out. The run rate on that is small, but generally speaking, we look at these things, we look for a reasonably short term in terms of payback, in terms of recouping those expenses but this has been something we were just waiting for the market to recover, but it's a small item.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. And then, hoping to ask a follow-up for your previous comments on FICC. I think you commented that the quarter wasn't a particularly strong one, even though the year-over-year growth was good. And it seemed like you commented that you are gaining share in FICC, at least among some market participants.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">But if we look at year-to-date trends in revenue, it does look like some of the U.S. money center banks are growing double digit plus over 2015 year to date, whereas Goldman's revenue is down. Can you help us understand maybe why that's diverging? Is it a business mix issue? Is there something else going on? Are you shifting away from certain clients or what have you? Any help you could give us there, Harvey, would be great.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes. It's no problem. I think that's more environment-specific. So it could be in some aspects, different footprint. All these businesses at this stage in FICC, and we don't have much visibility in FICC competitors, they're all very different. Some of these are enormous balance sheets. Some of them are very big in emerging markets, some are not.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I think when you look at it I wouldn't overemphasize the first quarter '15, which I think is really the factor that's influencing your math. And again I wouldn't overemphasize the performance that we had in the third quarter either, because things just don't shift that quickly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I think that the third quarter was solid for us. But as I talked about currencies, commodities was down year-over-year. So it certainly wasn't an environment we were hitting on all cylinders and even with that, we were in a double-digit ROE environment. So it feels pretty good to us and the momentum feels good.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Hey Harvey, Wanted to start off with just a follow-up question relating to the earlier merchant banking discussion. Recognize that many of the recommendations are, in fact just that, that have come from the regulators. But just thinking about the strategy for this business, longer term, looking at the activities more broadly, it's been a very good profit source, historically, but it also consumes significant amounts of capital.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And under a CCAR lens, some have speculated it could even be ROE dilutive overall. I was wondering, given the current backdrop and some of the high-end regulatory scrutiny, whether you have considered strategic alternatives for the business, such as an IPO or a spin that could generate value while maybe allowing for some degree of regulatory unshackling?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So I think you're right to underscore, which I mentioned earlier, the fact that over time, the CCAR requirements under -- let's just use private equity investing and corporate equity have certainly increased. Now the nice thing about that analytic framework is it's perfectly transparent with the global market shops are etcetera. So you can certainly evaluate investments that you're making.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Now we're talking about investments at the bottom part of the capital structure and so in terms of the return profile, we're obviously very selective about how we deploy that capital. But as I mentioned before, one of the nice things about launching this fund is it does gives us flexibility in terms of how to think about deploying that capital and it creates a new important product for our clients. So we have options.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Got it. Okay. That's very helpful color, Harvey. Thank you and maybe just one follow-up on the capital side. Actually, we're shifting over to the denominator. It is quite evident that you have made significant strides in mitigating your standardized RWAs. I think it's down about 15% since the end of 2014. But the advanced risk rated assets have actually crept higher.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I know some of that is going to be a function of increases in op risk. But I was hoping you could speak to any mitigation potential that you can achieve on the advanced risk rated assets moving forward, particularly if the Collins floor does end up applying to some of the new proposed capital changes that Tarullo spoke to in his recent remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes. So as I mentioned on the advanced transitional, we're at 12.4% under the current capital regime. Obviously, that gives us more than enough capacity. We obviously have things that roll off and things like that, but not material enough for me to highlight for you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">But to the extent to which I think at this stage whether you look at the supplementary leverage ratio, standardized, advanced, we have the tools in place through our return on attributed equity framework, the ROE framework, which we talked a lot about.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">We have the tools in place at this stage and more importantly, the culture, the people engagement across the entire firm. We will adapt if needed but right now we feel we have more than enough capacity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Got it. Thanks for taking my questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Sure. Steve.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question is from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Good morning Harvey. Thanks for taking my question. Just a couple of quick ones. You mentioned that there was the strongest inflow of AUM in the quarter was in fixed income. Any color as to what was driving that and if those were -- was that all liquidity or was it slightly higher margin flow?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">No. So liquidity products, I believe, it's up $2 billion in the quarter. So this was long-term fee-based assets that were really the driver. And the team has done a very good job in their advisory businesses and so that I would say would be the more meaningful part of the driver in terms of this quarter's flows.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay, and just circling back to another question previously asked. If I back out the charge that you took in occupancy this quarter, it looks like, as well as litigation, it looks like you are running in the last couple of quarters at around 24%, 25% non-comp to revenue ratio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I understand revenue can be a bit volatile, but it's been trending prior to that at 30%-plus. Is 25% a new run rate? Or is it really going to depend -- should we really think more about the dollar value rather than the ratio?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">We don't target a ratio. You should think of the ratio as an output. Now obviously, we have been very diligent around expenses over the last couple of years reflecting the environment. If you happen to have a lot of historical financials, you would see that market development this quarter was under $100 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I think it's the lowest it's been in seven years. So obviously we've been very focused on this, but we don't target a ratio. And a big driver obviously is BC&amp;E and if you saw big activity pickup, that would move with the environment as well. But we're very focused on expenses as you know.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yes, thanks very much. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question is from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Thanks very much. Hi, how are you Harvey? Just to step back for a moment, can we just talk about how we should contemplate revenue growth across the mix of businesses more broadly? Because I look at what happened this quarter and what's occurred over the course of the year. And in the underwriting businesses and in the advisory business, obviously you know the statistics much better than I. But advisory may be moving to a new, lower plateau than what we've seen recently. And with all the cross currents running through the trading environment and through the investing environment, how do we contemplate the overall go-forward mix of business?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So I think we don't target the mix, as you know. We focus on the clients in those businesses where, as you know, we have leading market positions and so we feel good about that. I think it's a bit more of what's your expectation for the environment is.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">We control the micro issues we can focus on, our client engagement, expenses, capital management. But a lot of the things are outside of our control and I would say that in aggregate, when you look at the vast majority of our businesses, this is not an extraordinary environment, despite the fact that third quarter performance was strong on a relative basis, there's lots of challenges regionally.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">You could certainly envision an environment that was significantly better from where we are today. You've heard us say this a lot, but we look for growth and an environment of negative interest rates in vast parts of the world is not indicative of a role that's growing at great pace. So you could see much better environments than we have today, and we hope that ends up being the case.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">But just from a planning perspective, I mean is there any reason to think that, or that this environment, that those policy dynamics are changing over, let's say, a medium-term horizon?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Just like I think they could change always pretty quickly for a negative, and we tend to be more contingency planners. You could certainly see things break for the high side. Obviously, rates could move back into positive territory, which should be an indicator and there's been speculation in the market that we might be more in the cusp of that in the United States.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I think the most important takeaway is whether or not we move into that environment in the near term? We're incorporating all those current factors in how we're running the firm today, which in a pretty muted environment, we're able to grow revenues, demonstrate a double-digit ROE and we truly believe we're well positioned in the franchise with significant operating leverage if the environment improves. So we feel quite good about our position, but we are rooting for a better environment for everybody.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And if I could sneak in one last one on Marcus. Most firms that do similar kind of lending typically have a 2.5% to 3% pre-tax ROA. How does that compare with what it is you are targeting?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So that's perfectly consistent with what we're able to generate. Of course, we don't have any legacy infrastructure cost structure. This is all white sheet of paper for us. So we'll see how it evolves, but that's certainly achievable.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. Thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin Ryan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Thanks, good morning, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Hi how are you, Devin?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin Ryan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Good. So it seems like we are speaking a lot more about your technology footprint on these calls. And you have been increasingly highlighting a number of those capabilities. When we look at those initiatives, like Marcus or Symphony, Marquee, or consolidating the electronic trading book across businesses, and maybe I missed something there, but where do you see the most immediate opportunities to actually move the needle?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And I guess that's part one. Part two is as you think about future investments in the technology, do you think more of the incremental spend from here is going to be more offensive positioning, revenue-producing, rather than defensive?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So it's a great question. I would say that broadly speaking, and this won't be completely inclusive, but I think you can define our technology strategy as focused on client engagement and those tools and services we can deliver to clients that provide differentiated value to those clients, and you see that doing us in our capital markets businesses and obviously you see us creating that with Marcus.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Two, there are times when we feel like given our core technology skills, we're in a position to develop technology, which will be better enhance outside of the firm ultimately even though we incubated it in the firm, and Symphony will be a great example of that. We feel like as an information sharing platform with better security, better compliance controls, we felt like that was something better utilized by a broad range of market participants.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And lastly, our own technology internally is quite important for making us more efficient and adapting to regulatory change and managing our risks, and that's obviously been very core to what we do. So we look across all three of those different platforms if you will, for lack of better language.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I would say the most important thing in addition to controlling the firm is our client engagement and Marcus reflects that trend as it relates to consumers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin Ryan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Got it, that's great. Very helpful. Maybe just a quick follow-up. Just any update on the momentum in deposit gathering within the online bank? Just how that has been, I don't know if you give any numbers there, but how that's been maybe relative to expectations now that we are a little ways away from the launch?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So it's more than exceeded our expectations. I think in the past quarter, we picked up another $1 billion of deposits and so the momentum there feels quite good and the team's done an excellent job of transitioning the platform into Goldman.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin Ryan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Got it, okay. Thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Hey Brian.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Hi Harvey, actually I'm all good. All my questions were asked. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. Great. Thanks, Brian.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And your next question is from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thanks. Going back to the comp ratio, and what you said earlier about as revenues go higher, the comp ratios should really drift lower. As we are having lower revenues this year, the comp ratios should probably drift a little bit higher than it was last year. Is that the concept you were really pushing forward earlier?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So this is completely consistent, Marty. As you know, you've been following us forever in terms of broadly speaking and it may not be the case in any given year. But broadly speaking, we've encouraged you to expect that compensation and benefits expense will lag revenue moves.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So you've seen it through the first -- through the year-to-date. 41% is our best estimate but revenues are down 15%; compensation and benefits expense, down 13%. In environments where revenues are up, base case, you should expect a lag in that direction also particularly given how much we've emphasized operating leverage with you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">That is what I thought. I've just been spoiled the last two year with revenues being fairly consistent on a year-on-year basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">The other thing I was going to ask was, you had mentioned you had four businesses, which is outlined on income statement very clearly. When you talk about the new consumer business and lending, it really doesn't fit into any of those four. Do you feel like you could put deposits maybe in asset management? But are you thinking about this as evolving into a fifth business? Or how would you tuck it into your overall strategic mix today?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So three of the four segments are up this year obviously. The one segment, which we worked hard to unpack for everybody is Investing &amp; Lending and this would very naturally fall into the lending segment. Obviously, to the extent to which down the road as an activity in and of itself, if it had material contribution, we could talk about highlighting more, but I think it will give a lot of attention as it grows anyway, it's pretty exciting.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Got you. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thanks Marty.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So since there are no more questions, I just really want to take a moment to thank all of you for joining the call. Hopefully, I and other members of senior management will see many of you in the coming months.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">If any additional questions come up, please don't hesitate to reach out to Dane or the team. Otherwise, please enjoy the rest of your day and I look forward to speaking with you on our fourth quarter earnings call in January. Take care, everyone, and thanks again.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs third quarter 2016 earnings conference call.

My name is Dennis, and I'll be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs' Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today, January 20, 2016.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you. Mr. Holmes, you may begin your conference.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Dane Holmes</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. Today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the Firm's belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain and outside of the Firm's control. The Firm's actual results and financial condition may differ possibly materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">For discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the Firm's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our current Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 2014. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, global core liquid assets, and supplementary leverage ratio. And you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that's posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">This audiocast is copyrighted material of the Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent. Our Chief Financial Officer, Harvey Schwartz, will now review the firm's results. Harvey?</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thanks, Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I'll walk you through the fourth quarter and full year results and I'm happy to answer any questions. Before outlining our results, I would like to discuss the previously announced settlement for legacy mortgage activities. As you know we took a total net provision for litigation and regulatory matters in the fourth quarter of $1.95 billion. The RMBS Working Group matter, was the most significant outstanding piece of litigation facing the firm. As you would expect, following a settlement, there has been a significant decline in our recently possible loss number. We are currently estimating a more than 60% decline compared to third quarter levels of $5.3 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Now turning to the fourth quarter, net revenues were $7.3 billion. Net earnings were $765 million and earnings per diluted share were $1.27. With respect to our annual results, we had Firm wide net revenues of $33.8 billion, net earnings of $6.1 billion, earnings per diluted share of $12.14 and a return on common equity of 7.4%. Revenues were down slightly compared with last year and expenses were significantly higher due to approximately $4 billion of net provisions for litigation and regulatory matters. Despite these headwinds, we grew book value per share by 5%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">The growth combined with our risk reduction efforts, strengthened all of our regulatory capital ratios. Excluding the litigation charges related to the RMBS Working Group, our 2015 return on common equity would've been 380 basis points higher.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">2015 presented both challenges and opportunities. The challenges were more acutely felt in the back half of the year, as concerns about global growth intensified, which is reflected in public equity markets, with the MSCI rolled down, 5.7% over the last six months of the year. Credit markets also reflected these concerns, particularly within the non-investment grade space and most acutely within the commodity sector. For example, U.S. high yield spreads were 157 basis points wider in the second half of 2015. And at the end of 2015, the trailing 12 month default rate for U.S. non-investment grade bonds more than doubled year-over-year climbing to 4.3%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">These factors negatively impacted the broader opportunity set for our clients and as a consequence for the Firm. To varying degrees, the firm faced headwinds within certain of our FICC businesses, underwriting within investment banking and our investing and lending activities. However, these significant headwinds were largely offset by client activity in other businesses. Many of our clients decided to pursue M&amp;A as the best means for creating shareholder value. And now M&amp;A volumes for the industry increased by 47% in 2015. The Firm's volumes increased by 81%, a significant expansion of our market share.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Our global equities franchise also posted strong results for the year. Clients continue to place significant value on the integration of our various services; electronic, cash, derivatives and prime brokerage as well as our global footprint. Our performance in 2015 highlighted these strengths. In addition, the combination of continued strong performance for our clients and the diversified set of offerings drove a record year for our Investment Management business. We ended the year with record assets under supervision of $1.25 trillion and robust net inflows, which totaled $94 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Ultimately, 2015 reinforced a long standing operating principle, that there is tremendous value to having a diversified set of global businesses. More importantly, it is the value of being a leader in these businesses that really counts.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Now let's discuss the individual businesses in greater detail. As it relates to the quarter, Investment Banking produced net revenues of $1.5 billion, slightly lower than the third quarter. A pickup in M&amp;A was offset by a decline in underwriting activity. For the full year, Investment Banking net revenues were $7 billion, up 9% from 2014 on the back of a 40% increase in financial advisory revenues. This was partially offset by lower equity and debt underwriting revenues.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Our franchise remains very strong. 2015 was our second highest annual revenues for Investment Banking. We ended the year ranked 1st in global and announced and completed M&amp;A. Our completed M&amp;A volumes were approximately $350 billion higher than our next closest competitor. A record gap, since we've been a public company. We were also ranked 1st in global equity and equity related and common stock offerings for 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Breaking down the components of Investment Banking in the fourth quarter; advisory revenues were $879 million, a 9% improvement relative to the third quarter reflects an increase in a number of completed M&amp;A transactions. We advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the fourth quarter, including SunGard's $9.1 billion sale to Fidelity National Information Services. General Electric Capital Corporation's $9 billion sale of its Transportation Finance business to BMO Financial Group and HCC Insurance Holding's $7.5 billion sale to Tokio Marine Holdings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We also advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the fourth quarter, including DuPont's combination with Dow Chemical in a $130 billion merger of equals, Newell Rubbermaid's $20 billion acquisition of Jarden Corporation and SanDisk's approximately $19 billion sale to Western Digital.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Moving to underwriting, net revenues were $616 million in the fourth quarter down 11% sequentially as debt issuance slowed. Equity underwriting revenues of $228 million were up 20% compared to the third quarter as IPOs increased from very low levels last quarter. Debt underwriting revenues decreased 21% to $440 million due to a decline in leveraged finance activity. During the fourth quarter, we actively supported our clients' financing needs, participating in Visa's $16 billion investment grade offering to support its purchase of Visa Europe, McDonald's $6 billion investment grade offering and Worldpay Group's $3.8 billion IPO. Our Investment Banking backlog improved from third quarter levels and finished at its second highest level.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our fixed and equities businesses; net revenues were $2.9 billion in the fourth quarter, down 10% compared to the third quarter. For the full year, $15.2 billion of net revenues were roughly consistent with 2014. FICC Client Execution net revenues were $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter down 23% sequentially and included $54 million of DVA losses. Excluding DVA, revenues were down 10% quarter-over-quarter as many businesses were impacted by either lower client activity or more difficult market making conditions. Credit decreased significantly, as the market was characterized by widening high yields spread in the U.S. and low levels of liquidity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Interest rate in currencies were lower sequentially as client activity declined. Mortgages continue to be challenged as spread widened and the prospect for higher rates and client activity remained generally low. Commodities was essentially unchanged as client activity was muted and energy prices remained under pressure. For the full year, FICC Client Execution net revenues were $7.3 billion down 13% year-over-year, where challenging market conditions and lower levels of client activity in our micro businesses, credit and mortgages, offset stronger client activity and a favorable backdrop for our macro businesses, particularly rates and currencies.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees and securities services, net revenues for the fourth quarter were $1.8 billion, flat sequentially and included $14 million in DVA losses. Equities client execution revenues were roughly consistent sequentially at $562 million. Commissions and fees were $763 million, down 7% relative to the third quarter as global client volumes declined. Securities services generated net revenues of $430 million up 13% sequentially.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">For the full year, equities produced net revenues of $7.8 billion up 16% year-over-year. In 2015, we benefited from several factors, a better market backdrop and a more favorable environment from securities services. Turning to risk, average daily VaR in the fourth quarter was $71 million down from $74 million in the third quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Moving on to our investing and lending activities, collectively these businesses produced net revenues of $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of $1 billion, primarily reflecting the company's specific events, including financings, sales and gains in public equity investments. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $299 million which was largely driven by net interest income. For the full year, Investing &amp; Lending generated net revenues of $5.4 billion driven by $3.78 billion in gains from equity securities and $1.66 billion of net revenues from debt securities and loans.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In Investment Management, we reported fourth quarter net revenues of $1.6 billion. This was up 9% from the third quarter, primarily as a result of $190 million in incentive fees largely from alternative asset products. Management and other fees were up 2% sequentially to $1.24 billion. For the full year, Investment Management net revenues were a record $6.2 billion, up 3% from 2014, on record management and other fees and higher transaction revenues. During the fourth quarter, assets under supervision increased $64 billion to a record $1.25 trillion, primarily due to net inflows into liquidity products. On a full year basis, we had long term fixed income flows of $41 billion, equity inflows of $23 billion, and alternative inflows of $7 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Moving to our performance, 73% of our client mutual fund assets ranked in the top two quartiles on a three year and a five year basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as benefits, remained roughly flat at $12.7 billion for 2015 and translated into a compensation to net revenues ratio of 37.5%. Fourth quarter non-compensation expenses were $4.1 billion and incorporated $1.95 billion in litigation and regulatory expenses. The quarter also included a $123 million donation to Goldman Sachs Gives, our donor advised charitable fund.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">For the full year, non-compensation expenses were up 30% due to $4 billion in provisions for litigation and regulatory matters. Excluding litigation provisions, non-compensation expenses would have been down 4% year-over-year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Now I'd like to take you through a few key statistics for the end of the year. Total staff at year end was approximately 36,800, up 8% from year end 2014. This is a significant increase, so let's breakdown the drivers. Of the 2,800 of incremental staff, a little more than half was due to our continued investment in regulatory compliance and other federation initiatives, largely in technology and operations. The remainder was focused on business growth initiatives, particularly with Investment Management.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Our effective tax rate was 30.7% for 2015. Our global core liquid assets ended the year at $199 billion. While our balance sheet was roughly flat year-over-year, Level 3 assets declined by 33% to $24 billion. Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 12.4% under the Basel III advanced approach. It was 13.6% using the standardized approach. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 5.9%. With respect to our method to G-SIB surcharge, we currently estimate that we are at or near the lower bucket, given a decline in Level 3 assets and derivative notionals over the course of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">And finally, we repurchased 8.9 million shares of common stock for $1.65 billion in the quarter. For the full year, we repurchased $4.2 billion. Year-over-year, our average fully diluted share count declined by approximately [15 million]. In addition, we increased our quarterly dividend to $0.65 per share in the second quarter and paid out approximately $1.2 billion of common dividends during the year. In total, we returned $5.4 billion of capital to shareholders in 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Before taking questions, a few closing thoughts. Clearly, it has been a challenging environment for the entire industry. 2015 marks the fourth consecutive year that we have posted revenues of approximately $34 billion. Excluding litigation charges related to the RMBS Working Group, it is also the fourth consecutive year that we have produced strong relative results and returns that exceeded our cost of capital. We have been able to post consistent, strong relative results despite the difficult operating environment, which is a statement of the strength of our global client franchise, the caliber of our people and our culture of teamwork and adaptability.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Over the past four years, we've also grown book value per share by 7% per annum, returned nearly $25 billion in capital to our shareholders and reduced our basic share count by 75 million shares or 14%. And most importantly we've been able to accomplish these things while maintaining leading positions across all of our businesses, transforming our financial profile, prudently managing our risks, adapting to regulatory change, continuing to invest in our future and positioning the Firm to provide significant operating leverage when the environment improves.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">There's no doubt that the second half of 2015 had its fair share of challenges, which significantly impacted market sentiment and client activity. It's quite natural for all of us to be influenced by recent events and we maintain a healthy respect to them. We certainly don\u2019t control the opportunities set, however we do control several things; how we build our client relationships, how we invest in our people, how we adapt to change, how we allocate our capital, manage our risks and control our costs, and finally, how we invest in the future. We believe our Firm's commitment to excellence in these areas has been and will continue to be what drives our performance over the long term.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Thank you again for dialing in and I'm happy to answer your questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p5\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Ladies and gentlemen we will now take a moment to compile the Q&amp;A roster. [Operator Instructions]</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">I guess you're in a better position than most to ask this impossible question, but from your vantage point everything you see, are we on the cusp of a tougher credit cycle, balance sheet recession? Are we looking at the wrong things meaning, I'm about to ask you your energy exposure and I should be asking you your sovereign exposure to Italian sovereigns or Italian banks like, I'm just curious to your thoughts on where we are besides the market going down?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So, look obviously the first couple of weeks of the year have been difficult from a market perspective and the last half of the year and continuing the dramatic decline in commodity prices broadly has been disruptive for the market. I think if you talk to our folks, obviously that sector of prices remain where they are, it's going to be under stress, that's an inevitability. But it does feel at this stage where perhaps the market is discounting some of the benefits of the declining commodity prices, we'll have to see how the market evolves. Look, these things are never going to be a straight line and so it's not surprising to some extent that the markets responding to China, reduced activity volatility in markets this way. In terms of our exposures to that sector, they haven't moved material since early [cost] across the entire oil and gas sector, Glenn. Funded and unfunded we had just more to $10 billion of exposure but to really dial it in for you, funded exposure to non-investment grade entities in that sector was a $1.5 billion as we finished the quarter. So, from our perspective we feel well positioned and in this kind of market environment, its type of market environment where your clients really want you to stay close to them and that's what we're doing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">A glass half full question of this increased volatility across some of the asset classes, using [indiscernible] clients of losing money, but is there any case to be made that [FICC] revenue pie can bottom and actually grow a little bit over the next say two years given the changing monetary landscape things like that monetary policy of landscape?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We don't generally run the businesses as you know as pretty well. We don't run the businesses for the bull case, but I think that, and there certainly is a bull case in terms of fixed income activity. The stable to improving global growth and we're seeing that in the U.S., and we're seeing that across Europe certainly could be a tailwind diverging monetary policy, could be a tailwind. Look, as we go through parts of the credit cycle it's very natural for spreads to widen after having a period of such strength in the contraction. But even right now you're seeing the market, which has been under stress, be thoughtfully selective about those transactions and there's been a lot of appetite for certain parts of the market. So I think as we look forward over the next couple of years, when you start adding in things like the competitive environments. For all the potential activity around hedging and other activities, I think you could construct a pretty impressive bull case for fixed income and again it's not the way we generally run the businesses, we'll react to that as we see it. But there's a -- there certainly is an upside case.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Okay, I appreciate that. Last one it takes two seconds is, did you say that you're at or near the 250 bucket, was that your comment about the G-SIB at or near the lower bucket, is that what you meant by that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Yes, that's correct. I mean that's our estimation. That's obviously not confirmed by the regulators, but that's where we believe we stood at the end of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Got it, okay. Thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Thank you, Glenn.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Your next question's from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Good morning, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So on Investment &amp; Lending, could you remind us how much of the equity portfolio you need to divest before the 2017 Volcker deadline? And just given the current choppy markets, what's your level of confidence that the Firm can divest those assets by 2017? And also remind us what the process for getting an extension from the Fed is if you can't meet the 2017 deadline? Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Thanks, so roughly now we're under $5 billion of capital that is sitting in funds alongside our clients, which are obviously legacy funds. The exact number's roughly right around $4.7 billion. And with our expectation given these are legacy funds is that we'll continue to monetize those assets and we'll see how that progresses. There's a lot of runway between here and the compliance date in 2017. We haven't at this stage contemplated seeking any additional extensions and I don't believe the industry has at this stage.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay thanks. And then maybe just some thoughts on the incremental operating leverage in the model, I mean the Firm has been very disciplined in expenses despite effectively four years of no top line growth. Just curious, how much more you can pull the expense lever to drive margin expansion or do you need some revenue growth there going forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So obviously we've done a lot of work on expenses, we were very early to expense reduction initiatives. As you know we started several years ago and those have continued, for those businesses that have faced headwinds and we've been investing in those businesses that we feel we've had tailwinds. At that point, headcount's up 8% this year and compensation benefits were flat, so we've done a pretty good job at this stage. We'll continue to monitor it, but at this particular -- given all the work we've done we will always look to be more efficient, but I think we chopped a lot of wood here. Now we have really, we believe well positioned the Firm for an uptick in revenues and even though it feels like a long time ago now, you saw that in the first quarter of last year where on a modest up in revenues year-over-year we produced nearly a 15% ROE. So we feel very comfortable about the upside leverage.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Your next question's from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Thanks, for taking the question. Just on the G-SIB surcharge I think you mentioned you know part of that was exiting from Level 3 assets, I don\u2019t know if there's any granularity or clarity on what that was or what you got out of, but just curious on the any color around that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So generally speaking, you remember during the course of the year that there was a change to the FASB accounting which was a driver in terms of the NAV and the look through the funds and the other driver obviously, to get back to Christian's question which is as we monetize things they become public equities. As you know the public equity has been hovering between $3.5 billion and $4 billion also and that's part of the monetization process and obviously once the public equity, you have complete transparency on pricing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay, got it. And then just on the expenses, I think you guys you have mentioned, you have done a pretty good job of balancing the investing versus the environment, but just want to get your sense when you think about what you're focused on the regulatory, the IT side that you need to invest versus areas where if we are in weaker markets and activity starts to dry up, where can you pull back on the cost front? And so whether it's on the non-com side, although it seems like that's running pretty low ex the legal stuff, or on the comp side?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Yeah, so I think -- but from a compensation perspective, compensation is always going to be driven by performance, most importantly at the Firm wide level and then obviously bottoms up from individuals to businesses and through [indiscernible]. And so that's where I think you'll see as related to the specific performance. We will always continue to look to be efficient. At this stage, obviously we're making a very significant investment in regulatory compliance. We think it's critically important. We actually think it's a competitive advantage to be best in class and so you'll see us continually invest in tech and businesses and over the long-term, we think it's a contributor to our performance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And last one, just on I&amp;L, given that portfolio and just given maybe the market backdrop, if you can just remind us of what portion I guess mostly on the equity side, would be public that you're going to see more like mark-to-market versus the portion that might be on the private side that might be more driven by models or economic growth that's not going to swing around as much?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Yeah, so coming into the end of the year, the public portion or public equity portion of the I&amp;L balance sheet was $4 billion of notional.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. Thanks a lot.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Sure. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">If you look at the size of the balance sheet, it came down by about $20 billion versus the end of the third quarter. Just thinking going forward how do you think the size of the balance sheet trends and then also with respect to SLR exposure?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Well, so obviously all of our capital ratios give us a great deal of flexibility to respond to client demand, so we feel like we're well positioned. Now, we talk about there's a lot in the past. We went through a pretty significant early shift in shrinking the balance sheet and that was really about a replacing effort. And so we're going to be very sensitive to marginal deployment of capital ensuring that it's accretive in the long run and so you're going to be as we pretty sensitive to balance sheet growth, but obviously given the strength of our capital ratios, we have a lot of capacity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And I guess following up on the SLR exposure specifically, you're obviously in excess of the 5% needed pre-CCAR, but for CCAR if you needed more, because do you have the ability to bring down some of the SLR exposure with only a modest impact to revenue?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So, it's interesting the way you ask the question. I think you're basically saying, listen can we re-price the balance sheet in an accretive way? If we could, we should, so we're doing that work today. I think if the world became more constrained then by definition re-pricing would be necessary. And so a lot of it'll be driven by constraints, but if we found ourselves constrained to any particular category, we will make a long-term decision about how we wanted to address that. Look for us as you know, CCAR stress has been a constraint and you saw us react to that a bit ago when we shrunk the balance sheet so dramatically.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. All right, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Couple of questions, one on I&amp;L again, in the past sometimes you've given us some color on how much has been either realized or mark-to-market and I get the $4 billion on equity component. Just wondering, if you can give us some color on how much of the split between second equity is on -- of realized base versus a marked base?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Yeah, so as you know Betsy we talk about in the context of event driven and non-event driven and that's what I talked about at the conference in the fourth quarter. So looking at I&amp;L as I said during the quarter, net interest income was really the bulk a driver of the debt line and in terms of I&amp;L relating to non-event driven most of the activity was really event driven or public marks. So things like refinancings, companies going public and then the subsequent public marks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay and then on a question regarding the stress test, a lot of people thinking out loud about what potential scenarios the Fed could throw at us and I'm just wondering on prior stress tests, are you given full credit for the hedges that you have on in the various asset classes that you're trading in?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">We have no transparency in to that level of detail with respect to the Federal Reserve but they're pretty comprehensive in their analysis, so one would assume everyone gets credit for their hedges.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Right. In your own analysis that you're running obviously, you give yourself credit for hedges?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yes. In the stress scenario they would perform, so we give ourselves credit, I mean, yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Right, of course. Just to make sure.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">[indiscernible] company's scenario on our own submissions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Correct in both.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yes, of course. Just like we'd model the Firm under any stress scenario.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So, when we're thinking about the commodity business that you've got, maybe you can talk through a little bit on how your positioned for the trend that we've been seeing here year-to-date?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So, we've been very committed to the commodities franchise and obviously we have a very strong banking franchise and so this is a part of the cycle and I'd say, broadly across commodities where clients are going to be in need of advice, they are going to need capital market solutions, they're going to need potential hedging solutions depending on where they sit in the cost structure or scheme of things. And so I think a lot is expected when you marry those two strengths together with our research and analytic tools, I think we feel very well positioned to provide our clients with advice and value and solutions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Do you see yourself taking share in this environment?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">In commodities -- well just talk commodities in a fixed income context, as I said in my prepared remarks, it's pretty obvious we took share in Investment Banking over the course of the year. I mean assuming you saw the big uptick in M&amp;A, you saw a big outperformance by our team. In terms of the FICC activity, it's hard to see it when activity is low but certainly really not in comparison to commodities where activity has been high to us, we've picked up significant share but that's probably not surprising given how much people have pulled resources out of their commodity businesses or least they said, they have over the last couple of years globally.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thank you, Betsy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hi. I guess, I'll go to energy and how big a deal is this oil price decline to you guys? I mean you've mentioned you only have $1.5 billion in funded non-investment great exposure but your total exposures are over $10 billion. Where could you up potentially otherwise get hurt from the decline in oil prices other than that funded non-investment grade exposure? And where could be industry otherwise get hurt or you might have to pay attention to some of the counterparties that you have?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So, from a counterparty exposure, our counterparty risk we feel good about right now, I think, I mentioned on an earlier call, if you take the example that the commodity trade houses, our exposure to those is less than $200 million as we sit here today. And I talk about the $10.6 billion that I brought out earlier, $6.4 billion of that -- again this is funded and unfunded, this is not funded, $6.4 billion out of the investment grade, so the maximum potential exposure we can get in non-investment grade companies would be $4.2 billion and that's absolute exposure that does not -- that's not recoveries or anything like that Mike. So, in terms of our capital position, I think we are relatively well positioned. I haven't gone through all the peer banks like you have but look for us, while we're very focused about and we're certainly not being complacent about it, we feel pretty front footed even on a relative basis, we have smaller exposures.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">What sort of reserves --</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I think Mike for us, if this translates into somehow, which we don't see today but you never discount any possibility, if this somehow translates into a real drag on a long-term economic activity or economic growth, but as I said before when I was asked the question and it's just an opinion, lots of folks have been on this side of this discussion. When we talked to our people internally, it feels like the degree to which the market is focused on energy exposures has managed to discount the long term tailwind to the consumer and a reduction in cost across the globe. But that\u2019s how the markets we act into are now. So there maybe information content in that too.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So what sort of reserves do you have against that $10 billion exposure? I guess some of its mark to market but some of it's not.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So of the $10 billion obviously we\u2019re being thoughtful about our exposure. I can tell you for example the non-investment grade side, those reserves were in high single-digit percentages for that part of the portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So lastly just are you able to hedge some of that exposure, are you helping your clients to hedge? Are you getting additional business activity to do this, and if you could just elaborate on the benefit to consumers because certainly people aren\u2019t paying much attention to that if that\u2019s there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I can\u2019t quantify the benefit of consumers to you, but obviously over time, that translates into more purchasing power because obviously it's a good thing that people are paying less in the punt, the obvious offset to that and maybe more acute in the U.S. is obviously there is a lot of pain in this sector and that will lead to increased unemployment specifically in this sector and it has infrastructure spend impact. In terms of hedging, we can hedge on a case by case basis, it really depends specifically on the underlying and where we can and we think we should. Obviously, we do. As it relates to client activity, one of the things about this move because it came down so quickly, is it really did not give a lot of our clients the opportunity to hedge to the downside. Obviously, in these low price levels across commodities you would expect to see a pick up in the consumer side of hedging activity and we expect to start seeing that. But these moves have been pretty dramatic and usually what happens when they are this sudden is there is a bit of stepping back. But certainly we\u2019re well positioned to provide hedges across the broad commodity space.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thanks, Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So I wanted to broaden out the market share of activity question that came up before with respect to commodities. More broadly, with respect to FICC globally we\u2019ve seen so much retrenchment including a big domestic player recently. So, any signs yet that the retrenchment of competitors in the area is helping market share or helping pricing? And to what extent is what you\u2019re seeing there or the expectation of what you\u2019ll see there really driving some of that investing in the business that you\u2019re talking about?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Well, we certainly have seen it across parts of the businesses, it\u2019s been somewhat episodic. We talked it before we\u2019ve seen it in securities services and prime brokerage, a bit of a retrenchment. I think that was more regulatory driven as people began to focus on balance sheet and capital related to that business. We\u2019ve seen it in parts of equity derivatives during the course of really now last year, year and a half. And then in fixed income, one of the things that shouldn\u2019t get lost about the fixed income discussion in 2015 for our Firm is that, while it was a difficult market for the micro products for credit and mortgages, it was actually an improved year for interest rates for currencies. And while commodity wasn\u2019t improving, came up very strong year prior, I think that we\u2019re seeing it when activity picks up. Now, in terms of the announcements and the retrenchment from competitors, one of these things is it's not surprising that you need to have a couple of or several tough years and that announcements will generally lag. And so, I think we may see this over the next couple of years now that we\u2019ve been in this period of a tough couple of years in FICC and where the vast majority of the industry has had multiple years of performing below their cost of capital. So all these things -- all these constraints are now really starting to come into the fray, particularly as we get into the 2018, 2019 compliance periods. Sorry, that was a long answer but it was a big question, but it was a long answer.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">No, it\u2019s a helpful answer. So I mean it sounds like you\u2019ve lost none of your confidence in the opportunity there, it just takes a while?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Well, in terms of the competitive set, I think that\u2019s our read today. Look, in terms of monitoring the businesses, we\u2019re always monitoring the businesses. I think one of the things that, one of the things that we haven't talked a lot about, we haven't talked directly about is our philosophy and how we manage cyclical businesses. Everyone has to acknowledge that financial services is a cyclical industry and one of the things that we've been very thoughtful about is not over investing at the top of the market. So, you didn't see us do that in 2009 when FICC had a record year and making sure that we don't overshoot in the bottom part of the cycle. Now we were early to the cost cutting because we felt the activity levels declining after 2009 and that's how we managed through the cycle and you've seen us do this in the equity businesses and sometimes these cycles are long. We cut 1,000's of people in our equity franchise in the early 2000s but right now given all the work we've done on the cost side, we don\u2019t feel like we need to catch up. So, but we'll see how the year goes, if the trends in fixing can continue, we will continue to manage the business as efficiently as possible.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And then just a follow-up question, since no one's asked it, I'll ask, I know we're only a few weeks into the year and the market backdrop has been, God awful, but how would you characterize activity levels since the beginning of 2016?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">It's only two weeks, so we're -- I'm not going to really extrapolate it. We generally don't root for the S&amp;P 500 to be down 8% in the first two weeks of the year though.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Maybe we should talk a little bit about M&amp;A with the volatility that we've seen in the market I think some have been concerned I guess about the impact on M&amp;A I guess both in the near term and what it means to for the cycle? Just maybe your just your broad thoughts on where we are in that cycle and what you're seeing in the conversation levels today?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So, again obviously we had a pretty significant pickup in activity over the last year and Goldman Sachs market share grew dramatically with that. I think you have to take a step back and you have to ask yourself what are the factors that drove the M&amp;A environmental [chord] over the past 18 months and are they still in place? And those core factors, is really limited organic growth, companies were struggling to find top line growth. You had positive but modest economic growth in major economies and companies had done quite a bit of work both on cost and refinancing going into that cycle and there was high level CEO and Board confidence. Those were the factors that drove the big pickup in activity. As we sit here today after couple of weeks of volatile markets, we wouldn't say that those factors are significantly diminished. We saw a very volatile August and yet in the fourth quarter, M&amp;A activity continued and we finished our backlog higher than last year. And so, I think that we'll have to see obviously if markets stand the stress and you get into questions about finance-ability and other headwinds and then if we saw a loss of confidence, but we wouldn't say that two weeks of volatile markets would stop a pretty powerful M&amp;A trend. We will see how these markets keep going.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And maybe just a follow-up on asset management. You had $48 billion of flows in liquidity products in the fourth quarter, what -- that seems pretty high. Can you -- what were the drivers there, is it, it's for the seasonal thing or are you seeing some market share gains there and as profitability improves with higher rates, do you see that as an opportunity?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">When you look across multiple quarters in asset management for us and you look at the flows and you look at the investment of the competitors I think you'd say we're gaining share. Obviously it's been a strategic focus for us to grow that business. In that quarter in particular I think it was a combination of volatile market and increasing rates, which brought money and obviously we're a leader in the money market business and so it was a catalyst for inflows.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Just a quick question on energy follow-up here I think you said $10 billion of total exposure, roughly two thirds in investment grade, is it right for us then to apply that sort of two-to-one investment grade, bull investment grade to your funded book as well and sort of back into about $3 billion funded IG exposure?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes, so why don't I just give you the -- I'll just give you the numbers so you will have all the detail. So $10.6 billion is what I would call total potential exposure. Funded is $1.8 billion, unfunded $8.8 billion. And of the funded non investment grade's $1.5 billion, and you could get an incremental $2.7 billion funded on that side. But that's the total exposure.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Terrific.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And you can fill in the rest of the grid on the investment grade stuff.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes, we can back in into the rest, thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question's from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura, please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So Basel published the updated guidance for the market risk calculations last week, I recognized the document and some of the calculations are pretty, the document says calculations are involved, I didn't know if you've done any preliminary analysis on the impact this might have on your pro forma market risk assets?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes, you're talking about the fundamental view of the trading book that came out last week. So as you said it is a pretty big document, I think it was over 90 pages. We had the team going through it, I don\u2019t have any specific quantification for you. I think it'd be too early for me to put that out there and we still haven't even seen an NPR from the Federal Reserve. So we'll to see how this evolves. I would say the high level read is that from the early documents and the early discussion it seems like the regulators in the industry may continue to progress in terms of trying to find the right balance. But at this stage for us I don't see it being a significant impact but we'll give you more detail.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">All right, I suppose over the last few quarters it does look like the market risk assets have been steadily declining. I didn't know if that reduction was in anticipation of what might be tougher rules or are there other factors that are really driving that decline?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">No definitely certainly not in anticipation of this, I mean just to be clear, we'll approach this rule like we've approached all the other rules. We don't want to try to adjust our business potentially have a negative impact to your clients. The one good thing, regulators have been very thoughtful about the runway to rule adoption. And this is something that we have till 2019. So the industry is going to have time to make adjustments and I think that's in everyone's best interest because it actually will be less disruptive to market, the incentive of this rule is significant and we've seen that in all the rules and so you'll see us approach this rule the way we approached all the other rules. But we haven't even seen as I said a Fed NPR so we'll see how that goes. But any reduction in market risk assets is really a [complexion] of client activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Got it, okay, and just one quick follow up, I did see that the advance Core Tier 1 did in fact decline quarter-on-quarter. I assume it's a function of the increase in operational risk tied to the settlement but didn't know if it was attributable to something else?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">No that's correct. So the settlement added $21 billion to operational risk assets and it had a corresponding decline in the ratio of roughly 40 basis points.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Great, I appreciate you taking my questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question's from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities, please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Good morning, Harvey. Just a couple of questions, I guess starting on M&amp;A. We've heard across both you and to a lesser extent some of your competitors about the potential for market share gains as some non-U.S. participants back away. But I think that's mostly focused, that those comments are mostly focused on the trading side of things. Given your market share gains in M&amp;A this year, do you get the sense that that's also true with Investment Banking in specifically M&amp;A transactions?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">No, I haven't had a chance to dig through all the lead tables and I may not have this perfectly accurate but the last time I spoke to our team about this, I think it was really that there's a segment of banks which lost share to some of the boutiques and there's firms like ourselves which obviously gained market share broadly across the board, and we took share from everyone else.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay and then just on FICC and trading, you've given us some helpful commentary and I realize it's early days in the year in the quarter, but I guess I'm curious, so what the level of rate positioning within your client base has been, did that change dramatically late in the fourth quarter with the Fed's action and has it changed much so far this year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Not a significant factor, really nothing to comment on that. Obviously, the Fed reserve data, very good job of communicating to the marketplace the first rate increase in December and I think to a great extent that it being a non-event, which is a good thing. And so early in the quarter it was influencing client activity, but by the time the event occurred, obviously it wasn\u2019t significant.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And just finally for me, I don\u2019t think you've given these. Can you provide us the fully phased in capital ratios at the end of the year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Sure, so under the advanced, we were 11.7 and under standardized 12.9. I remember that on a apples-to-apples basis, that's a little bit conservative just given away some of the items actually transitioned to fully phased in, but that's where we stood at.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question is from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I've obviously heard everything that you have said this morning and I recognize of course that you don\u2019t run the business to any particular metric ratio, but to the extent that revenue conditions sort of stay as they've been over the past few years and call it around that $34 billion level. Is there a path to generate incremental positive operating leverage for you?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So it's an interesting question. I'm going to modify it a little bit because of the way I heard it, maybe I'm not modifying because it is the way I heard it. I think you're saying if I knew over the next couple of years, like let's just say we had a crystal ball and with certainty I knew that the Firm is going to [gross] $34 billion over the next couple of years. Now, I guess what you're saying is the thing that we've elected to invest in, we shouldn\u2019t be investing in and so I think we wouldn\u2019t invest for growth because you're telling me it wouldn\u2019t be there, but that's not our expectation. We see growth in parts of our businesses and so where we see growth and where we think we can take share, we're going to invest. And again, we run the Firm for multiple years and so -- but that's the way I would think about answering the question, but we see opportunities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And what conditions would arise or what would be the signals to you that in fact it is appropriate to retrench on some of the growth opportunities?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Well, we always evaluate -- and at the end of the day, it's really about the dialog with the client. The dialog with the client, so let's take M&amp;A, we just talked about the things are interesting because now the current concern is that M&amp;A may slow down. Five years ago, you'll remember the dialog was M&amp;A is never coming back. And last year, we had dominant market share and tremendous activity levels across the industry. In 2009, our client dialog told us there were factors that were influencing decisions that were delaying decisions, but it certainly didn\u2019t tell us that no one would ever do mergers again. And so when we see, when we listen to the client and we know for example that our clients in fixed income still value the services, they just need to do more volumes, that's how we'll inform our strategy over the long run. But obviously we're not being complacent, you've seen all the things we've done. We've returned significant capital, we've cut costs and we're early to all those things, we have reduced risk, improved our ratio, so we're certainly not sitting still here. Revenues might be $34 billion for a couple of years because a lots going on.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And so at times as if then the indication is at this stage there's no change in client dialog or demands or expectations.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">No. Certainly not. After the first couple of weeks of the year, no.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question is from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Building on what you were just talking about, what are the things as the pipeline keeps building quarter-to-quarter, year-to-year that the customers are saying are delaying, so what factors do you need to see some of that pent up demand begin to get released and accelerate some of the activities you have seen even at the levels last year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So I think look again at its core, we're correlated to long-term economic growth and what we're really seeing in the markets in the second half of the year was really general concerns about economic growth that might be isolated to specific markets but really that's what was driving activity levels. I think more than anything else client conviction and I mean that in all spaces, whether we're managing a client's money, their conviction, their confidence, whether we're advising on a merger transaction, the CEO and the Board and the CFOs, their confidence levels. The same thing exists in the capital markets businesses and fixed income and equities. Now what leads to that, confidence in economic growth, reduced uncertainty. And so those are the factors that fuel activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I will ask you I think a more as a peer kind of question but I think it has some pertinence to what's going on. Given the rules that limited your ability and all the market makers ability to take on any risk, turning you basically into a conduit of transactions, when we see these types of disruptions in the marketplace, what are your traders saying in the sense of, how activities and clearing levels and new equilibriums get reached, when there isn't really any buffer still left in the market? So we're seeing some of the ramifications of Volcker now in distressed markets which can have I think some very unfavorable effects just on trading levels to get to a new clearing equilibrium?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Look, I don't know, if you and I are going to solve that, heated debate on a lot of different sides around the benefits of regulation, which are obviously numerous versus some of the unintended consequences potentially around liquidity. I would say, we feel like we had more than adequate capital and liquidity to be there for our clients and that's how we're positioning ourselves.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I guess, I just do you feel like the answers at certain times get to be over blown one way or another because of that unintended consequence?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I think that is a very complicated question which is very difficult for anyone to answer, which is, there's my own view there is not a rule that has had a big impact on market liquidity or lending across industries. I think something that's very difficult for anyone to quantify is, what is the economic impact of the collection of rules that have been put in place since the financial crises that impact capital liquidity, derivative, all sorts of things. I just think that, it's very hard to anticipate the combined effect of all that. But for us, we're just focused on the clients, Marty.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And then do you think the markets evolving to adapt to all that and how far along that process are we and that's last piece of that question. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I think firms are in different places. We've obviously invested tremendously in risk reduction change, technology tools, educating our people. So I think we feel pretty far along the curve. You have seen in our capital ratios and in the Firm's balance sheet how much has changed over the last. But I think it varies across the industry and so I really can't speak to everybody else.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Right, thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Thanks. Just a quick question on Investment Management, I mean, you've benefited from a couple of acquisitions there over the last year. Did you actually budget for growth from acquisitions as you look forward and what's the investment in that area expected to be?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So you've seen us do a number of bolt-on acquisitions, the one I think you are referring to this year was Pacific Global Advisors which was $18 billion in asset and they are focused on the pension and retirement space. We don't budget for acquisitions at all. We do it on a case by case basis and acquisitions that generally are a little bit simplified. They either give us a capability that we don't have today and we think it's better for us to have bolt-on versus build organically or they actually fit a current strength where we can add scale. That's like -- that's kind of the extreme end of the spectrum in terms of how we think about them, but it's a 100% case by case.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay and then just a follow up question on the Basel III and I'm sorry if I missed this, but did you give the RWA for the fully phased-in ratios?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">No, I didn't for the four -- do you want the fully phased-in?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Correct, yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So for fully phased-in, we are at 430 of credit risk and 104 marked risk, sorry about that. I was looking -- that was at standardized, another advance 587 that\u2019s 103 in operational, 353 in credit risk, 103 in market risk, sorry about that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question is a follow up from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So Harvey just on that same topic, it looks like your standardized RWA sequentially came down 10%. And I just wanted to know, first, what\u2019s the driving force behind that and just given the magnitude of the decline? And also just to clarify, that\u2019s the number that matters for the CCAR submission, if I remember correctly. Is that right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">That\u2019s correct. So, the standardized is the ratio using CCAR and the driver, the bulk of the driver was really in derivative notionals.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Everyone, thanks for dialing in today. And, myself and the rest of the team, we look forward to seeing you during the course of the year. If you have any follow up questions, please reach out to Dane and the team. Take care and have a great day.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs' fourth quarter 2015 earnings conference call.

My name is Dennis and I'll be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today, July 16, 2015. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Mr. Holmes, you may begin your conference.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Dane E. Holmes - Head-Investor Relations</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm's belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain and outside of the firm's control. The firm's actual results and financial condition may differ possibly materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">For discussion of some of the risk and factors that could affect the firm's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our current Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, global core liquid assets, and supplementary leverage ratio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">And you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that's posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com. This audiocast is copyrighted material to Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Our Chief Financial Officer, Harvey Schwartz, will now review the firm's results. Harvey?</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thanks, Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I'll walk you through the second quarter and year-to-date results then I'm happy to answer any questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Net revenues were $9.1 billion, net earnings $1 billion, earnings per diluted share $1.98, and our annualized return on common equity was 4.8%. For the year-to-date, net revenues were $19.7 billion, net earnings $3.9 billion, earnings per diluted share $7.93, and our annualized return on common equity was 9.7%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">In the second quarter, we recorded net provisions for mortgage related litigation and regulatory matters of $1.45 billion. Despite these charges, book value per common share was up 4% relative to year-end 2014. Excluding these litigation charges, net earnings were $2.3 billion, earnings per diluted share were $4.75, and our annualized return on common equity was 11.5%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">The second quarter of 2015 was another example of the benefits that come with having a diversified global client franchise. Certain businesses showed year-over-year strengths while others faced headwinds.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Investment Banking and Investment Management net revenues increased year-over-year by 13% and 14% respectively. The increase in net revenues within these primarily fee-based business s largely offset net revenue declines and are more capital-intensive businesses with a 6% year-over-year decline in Institutional Client Services and a 13% year-over-year decline in Investing and Lending.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">The benefits of diversity were even demonstrated at a business level. For example, strength in advisory and equity underwriting more than offset the year-over-year decline in debt underwriting, which was lower versus a record last year. And for Institutional Client Services, revenue strength within equities helped offset a difficult operating environment for FICC. Ultimately, we continue to benefit from our diverse set of market leading businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">If you look at our first half results, excluding the $1.45 billion litigation charge in the second quarter of 2015, you can see the embedded operating leverage, with expenses flat relative to revenues that are up 7% compared to last year. You can also see the improvement in several underlying performance metrics.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">These include a 440 basis point improvement in pre-tax margin, a 27% increase in net earnings, a 31% increase to diluted earnings per share, and finally, a 220 basis point improvement in ROE, to 13.1%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Now I will discuss each of our businesses. Investment Banking produced second quarter revenues of $2 billion, 6% higher than a strong first quarter. We continue to see the benefit of our leading global franchise, with second quarter revenues at the highest level since 2007.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Our Investment Banking backlog was down slightly compared to the first quarter and remained higher year-over-year. Breaking down the components of Investment Banking in the second quarter, advisory revenues were $821 million. The 15% decrease relative to the first quarter reflects a decrease in completed M&amp;A.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Year-to-date, Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced and completed M&amp;A. We advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the second quarter, including BHP Billiton's $12.7 billion demerger of South32; Synageva Biopharma's $8.4 billion sale to Alexion Pharmaceuticals; and Imperial Tobacco Group's $7.1 billion acquisition of certain cigarette brands and other assets of Reynolds American and Lorillard.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We also advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the second quarter. These include BG Group's \u00a347 billion acquisition by Royal Dutch Shell; Altera Corporation's $16.7 billion sale to Intel Corporation; and Pall Corporation's $13.8 billion sale to Danaher Corporation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Moving to underwriting, revenues were $1.2 billion in the second quarter, up 27% sequentially, primarily due to debt issuance. This was our second highest quarterly performance in underwriting. Year-to-date, we ranked first in global equity and equity-related and common stock offerings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Equity underwriting revenues of $595 million rose 12% compared to the first quarter, due to an increase in IPOs. Debt underwriting revenues of $603 million improved 47% quarter-over-quarter, largely driven by an increase in leverage finance activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">During the second quarter, we actively supported our client's financing needs. Leading Qualcomm's $10 billion debt IPO, Daiichi Sankyo's $3.2 billion sale of its stake in Sun Pharmaceutical, and AIG's $3.5 billion sale of its stake in AerCap.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our FICC and Equity businesses, net revenues were $3.6 billion in the second quarter, down 34% compared to the seasonally-stronger first quarter. FICC Client Execution net revenues were $1.6 billion in the second quarter, and include $153 million of DBA gains.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Net revenues were down substantially from the first quarter, as client activity declined across our businesses and market-making conditions were more difficult. Within interest rates and currencies, a shifting macro backdrop negatively impacted client activity and results. While currency has experienced a significant decline, client activity and interest rates, though sequentially lower, remain solid.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Credit was significantly lower, as credit spreads generally widened during the second quarter and activity levels declined. Mortgages also declined versus the first quarter, as volatility and client activity remained generally low. Commodities decreased significantly, with reduced levels of volatility and client activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In Equities, which includes Equities Client Execution, commissions and fees, and security services, net revenues for the second quarter were $2 billion, down 14% quarter-over-quarter and included $32 million in DBA gains.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Equities Client Execution net revenues decreased 30% sequentially, to $787 million. Client activity levels remained high this quarter, though not as high as the first quarter. Commissions and fees were $767 million, down 5% relative to the first quarter. Security services generated net revenues of $443 million, up 13% sequentially, reflecting seasonally-stronger client activity and higher customer balances.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to risk, average daily VaR in the second quarter was $77 million, down from $81 million in the first quarter, reflecting a decrease in commodities and interest rates.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Moving on to our Investing and Lending activities, collectively, these businesses produced net revenues of $1.8 billion in the second quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of $1.3 billion, primarily reflecting strong corporate performance and company-specific events in private equity, as well as net gains in public equities. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $547 million, with roughly $225 million in net interest income, and the balance coming from net gains.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In Investment Management, we reported second quarter net revenues of $1.6 billion, up 4% from the first quarter. This represented the second highest quarterly performance for Investment Management. Management and other fees were up 4% sequentially, to a record $1.25 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Revenues benefited from a higher average mix of long-term fee-based products relative to liquidity products. Assets under supervision increased $5 billion, to a record $1.182 trillion. Long-term net inflows of $14 billion, largely driven by fixed income products, were somewhat offset by net market depreciation of $3 billion and net outflows of $6 billion in liquidity products.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Moving to performance, across the global platform, 76% of our client mutual fund assets were in funds ranked in the top two quartiles on a three-year and a five-year basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior-year equity awards and other items such as benefits was again accrued at a compensation to net revenues ratio of 42%. Second quarter non-compensation expenses were 59% higher than the first quarter. Substantially all of the increase was related to litigation charges.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Now, I'd like to take you through a few key statistics for the second quarter. Total staff was approximately 34,900 up 1% from the first quarter. Our effective tax rate for the year-to-date was 31.2%. Our global core of liquid assets averaged $181 billion. Our common equity tier 1 ratio was 11.8% using standardized approach. It was 12.5% under the Basel III Advanced approach. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 5.7%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">And finally, we repurchased 1.2 million shares of common stock for $245 million in the second quarter. As discussed last quarter, related to our share repurchase capacity, any potential share repurchases over the next four quarters will be back-end weighted.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In closing, a few comments. The second quarter of 2015 provided its share of opportunities and challenges. On one hand, our results reflect a continuation of some positive macro trends. Our Investment Banking clients remain focused on their strategic alternatives. There is also a strong demand for financing solutions. We see solid client activity in equity products, particularly outside of the United States, and there was a growing need for active investment management options.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On the other hand, the operating environment for our FICC clients was more challenged in the second quarter. The combination of current concern surrounding Greece's widening credit spreads and the reversal of certain macro trends led to lower client activity and a more difficult operating environment. More recently, market participants have been focused on the Chinese economy. This follows the more than 30% decline in the Shanghai Index during the early part of July from peak levels in June.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Against this mixed backdrop, we remain focused on driving value for our shareholders. Year-to-date, excluding litigation charges, we have posted strong results in many of our key investor metrics, including earnings per share, ROE, and book value per share.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As we have mentioned many times before, our management team isn't overly focused on any one quarter or, for that matter, any six month period. Our focus is on the strength of our global client franchise, the quality of our people, and the long term trends driving our businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Regarding trends, we see many opportunities ahead. For example, the competitive landscape is in significant flux. In addition to strengthening the banking system, one of the positive things the regulation has achieved is leveling the competitive playing field.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">The world changed after 2008. We began to adapt to this new world immediately, and particularly to comply with new regulations. As part of this process we also scrutinized each of our businesses with the goal of both improving the client experience and our ability to generate appropriate shareholder returns.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We started early, we cut costs, we on-boarded new regulations, we sold businesses, and we developed a new capital framework. At the same time, we have been able to both expand and deepen our global client franchise.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As much as we are focused on the present, we are also focused on the future, and we enter it knowing we have a great set of businesses, we have tremendous client relationships, we have world-class people and execution capabilities, and last but not least, we have an improving competitive and operating landscape.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Thank you again for dialing in, and I'm happy to answer your questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p4\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Ladies and gentlemen, we will now take a moment to compile the Q&amp;A roster. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn P. Schorr - Evercore ISI</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Hi. Thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Good morning, Glenn.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn P. Schorr - Evercore ISI</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Good morning. So pretty darn good all around. I think FICC and I&amp;L take a lot of everyone's focus, but in FICC specifically, I wonder if you could help us, how much of that was a late quarter phenomenon? You spelled out what fell off in credit and mortgage, things like that. How much was a late quarter? How much have you seen some stabilization or reversal so far? And then most importantly, I think last quarter you felt really good about market share in client facilitation side of the business, and I'm curious if you can give any comments on parsing that out, the facilitation versus the marks in the quarter? Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">So in terms of timing of the quarter, we came off a strong first quarter, as you mentioned, and then we came in basically you saw a number of factors. I think the most significant one, obviously, Greece in the headlines continuously. And that certainly weighed on spread sensitive parts of the business like credit and mortgages. Early in the quarter, obviously, there was a big reversal in the macro trend with respect to how people were thinking about currencies and interest rates. And that was really more an interest rate differential and what's the Fed going to do discussion. And so it's not surprising that we saw reduced client activity in the quarter and obviously more difficult market-making environment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">In terms of \u2013 it was really more pronounced as the quarter went along as Greece really dominated the headlines and liquidity was challenged in parts of the market. And so it was really \u2013 it was more of an end of quarter phenomenon. Too early to tell in terms of where we are in this quarter, Glenn, but obviously, the news around Greece has been obviously very positive in the last couple of days. And so hopefully some of these trends are behind us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn P. Schorr - Evercore ISI</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">And then I think you talked about the competitive landscape in flux and we all see what's going on at each and every one of the European banks. I think your franchise composition is different in general. You see it in results this quarter, and mostly good. Just a question on the European shrinking. Do you want what they're shrinking? In other words, theoretically, they're going to shrink the tougher parts, the lower ROA types of the business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So in terms of how we think about it, and obviously these competitive trends they take years to really formulate. But I think the big change and I talked about this a little bit in my script, but to be more specific about it, the capital-intensive parts of the business and really let's just start with the fixed income parts of the business, given the regulatory demands around that part of the business to deliver for your clients and drive appropriate returns for shareholders, that is actually where we think the competitive advantage is most significant.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So if you just look at last year's collective industry ROEs, which are in the mid to higher single digits. Our relative position both the strength and the franchise but aggregate position of the firm just positions us quite well over the next couple of years if firms follow through on what they saying and they actually restructure and they begin to redesign those businesses. And so, as people exit the business, obviously, the impact of the marginal pressure on risk when you're deploying capital should be beneficial and we're leaders in all those parts of the franchise, but I think this is going to be a multi-year phenomenon.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn P. Schorr - Evercore ISI</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Okay. I don't want to put words in your mouth, but it sounds like there might be more volatility, but in the end, your shareholders are going to love the fact that you are bigger in some of those areas.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Well, we feel very confident about the business. That's the way I would describe it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn P. Schorr - Evercore ISI</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">All right, thanks. I respect the one and one. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Your next question is from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) LLC (Broker)</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Good morning, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Hey. Good morning, Christian.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) LLC (Broker)</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Hi. So my first question is on the CCAR and G-SIB \u2013 possible G-SIB's surcharges. So I'm sure you're aware that this chatter that that could be included in the CCAR process going forward. You know, you have been or Goldman has been pretty proactive in optimizing for CCAR, be it preferred issuance or reducing the gross balance sheet, but what are the levers can you pull if G-SIB buffers are included?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So as you pointed out, we obviously have been pretty dynamic with respect \u2013 I think the greatest example was a year ago when we brought the balance sheet down by nearly $60 million in the quarter. And that was predominately driven by CCAR and that was a repricing exercise, which led us to do that. So the way we'll think about this is a couple ways. First of all, it's only preliminary and we'll have to see the final rule, but our expectation is that at this stage given the information that we have, again preliminary, that any incremental buffer will be roughly 1%. And so, relative to the peer group, obviously, that puts us in a good position.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Now in terms of how to think about the implications for the test, we have no visibility into how the Federal Reserve is going to change the test. And so to the extent to which it changes, we'll look at all the same levers again. There will be an evaluation of how we should think about the capital structure of the firm, how we should think about how we're deploying our capital, how we think about pricing the marginal balance sheet and other aspects of our business. But we won't do that in advance of any changes in any regulatory rules. And we just don't know what they're going to do yet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) LLC (Broker)</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay. That's helpful. And then litigation costs, so how should we think about go-forward litigation costs? I guess over the last four quarters, you've averaged about $200 million per quarter, just given the big charge this quarter, all else equal, should we expect that run rate to slow down a bit?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So obviously, we took a significant charge this quarter. The vast majority of that is related to the RMBS Working Group. But the process with respect to these kind of legacy cost issues is, every quarter, based on the best information available, we create our best estimate and it's very case-by-case dependent. And so it can be somewhat unpredictable quarter-to-quarter. That's how I'd frame it for you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) LLC (Broker)</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay. So it doesn't sound like anything changes in terms of just kind of look forward here?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">I'm sure you understand this, Christian, given that these are \u2013 this is active litigation, very difficult for me to comment beyond what I said.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) LLC (Broker)</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">That's fair. Okay. Thank you for taking my questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Thanks so much, Christian.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael R. Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Hey, Harvey. Thanks a lot.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Hey, Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael R. Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Hey. Just on the equity trading, so year-over-year, the strength was pretty significant. I think you mentioned a few drivers of that. But just wanted to get a sense, are you seeing any, either market share gains in that part of the business or is it more environment and clients' investors getting more active in the asset class? I know you pointed to Asia, but I just wanted to find out if there was anything else driving that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">No. I think, obviously, it has been a good solid couple of quarters. Environmentally, for the first half of the year, the environment has clearly been better, both from a activity level and also from a market-making perspective, and so you're seeing that. The franchise is very diverse, both geographically and product line. And so I think when market activity picks up, you're just seeing the value of the franchise pull through. And as I said earlier, as activity has picked up outside of the U.S., I can't tell necessarily whether or not it's share pickup from other firms, but obviously, you've seen actually in the first quarter even, those firms with strong equity franchises seem to be getting the lion's share of the activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael R. Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay. Got it. And then just two kind of minor items, but on the legal cost, you mentioned this reserve, and it's always tough in terms of the outlook. But when you think about some of the major things that you guys have put behind you, and even the industry, when we think about the run rate going forward, are the majority of those items behind you? And then on the tax rate, just wanted to understand, if I exclude the item related to the legal reserve, it looks like the core tax rate still was relatively low versus expectations, in line with last quarter. So is the revenue mix away from the legal charge still beneficial? Meaning it's still coming in in lower jurisdictions? And so does that, for the full year, should we be thinking about that continuing?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So with respect to tax, you're right. It's roughly consistent with the first quarter and we're running below last year's full year, so you're right about that. That's both earnings-mix driven, and an election. You'll see in the earnings release this quarter with respect to certain earnings that we'll leave overseas. With respect to litigation, again, the charge we took this quarter is \u2013 the vast majority of that is related to the RMBS Working Group. And I'd really encourage you to look through our disclosure, and while I wish I could give you more detail, obviously, that's one significant item, a legacy item, that we look forward to getting behind us. But I really can't comment in more detail on that, given it's a live discussion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael R. Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. All right. Thanks a lot.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Hey, Mike \u2013 Matt, sorry.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Maybe a bigger picture question, on your traditional bank strategy, you had a key hire on the consumer side, or former consumer person. Maybe just talk about what you're thinking there on traditional bank strategy in general?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So, yeah, as everyone saw, we hired Harit and we're thrilled to have someone of his experience and caliber on board as a one of our partners. I would say at this stage, it's very early days and we've really done two things. We've identified a potential opportunity and we've identified a key hire, as I said, which we're very excited about. When we look at new opportunities what we look for in terms of making that evaluation is, what core competencies do we have and how can we bring them to any client base that we deal with. And so, we feel like there is a couple of strengths here that we have.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">One, we have a long history and a core competency in risk management. Two, we have a very, very big commitment to technology. Three, historically, we've been pretty good builders of new businesses. And, obviously, as it relates to, let's just call it the space of digitally-led consumer finance, we have no legacy cost, we have no legacy infrastructure to deal with. And so to the extent to which we can work with Harit and develop a strategy, which we believe is accretive to the firm and valuable to clients, we'll pursue it. But at this stage, it's early days. Harit's just on board, and so we'll be back to you with more details as things develop.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And then maybe separately, you mentioned head count was up just 1% linked quarter. Year-over-year, it's up 8%. Obviously, it's not causing any expense pressure as the expense management's been good, but just remind us just where those people are being added? And I guess are they more kind of junior, lower salaried staff?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So, the 1% increase in the quarter and the longer term increase it's really happening in two places. Part of it is driven by our growth in the Investment Management business and people that we've been adding there as that business continues to grow and our ongoing investment there. And really the other large portion of it relates to resources that we needed to deploy as we come into the more significant part of regulatory compliance. And so, these are all the new rules that the industry is affected by over the next couple of years. And so it's a bit of a surge, if you will, in terms of having people on board. And for example in the second quarter, about three-quarters of those folks were in places like Salt Lake City, Bangalore, and other locations.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Sorry, three-quarters of the people in the reg-related staff or of the additions?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Of the additions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Got it. Okay. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hey, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hey. How are you?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Good. I just had a couple of quick questions. One was on the G-SIFI buffer that you talked about earlier on the call. I just wanted to see \u2013 did you give us an update on what you think your surcharge is? I thought you were \u2013 before the most recent commentary it was like 2.5%. Are you saying now it's 2%?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">No, no. Same. No change. We don't have any incremental information. We think it's \u2013 obviously, we started with 1.5%. Under the proposal, we believe there's an incremental 100 (29:17), but again, I cautioned you that's the preliminary. We haven't seen the final rule, obviously.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. Got it. All right. Just wanted to make sure of that. And then on European competitors fading some of these businesses over time, how much does that matter to you when you think about the fact that the SIFI surcharge is in part a relative charge? So they fade naturally, you're going to grow as a percentage of total business. How much room is there to take on new business given the way the SIFI surcharge is structured?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yeah, it's a great question, Betsy, and obviously, a difficult one to think about over the next couple of years. But obviously there may be some unevenness in the playing field depending on how the rules actually get rolled out. But in the end, it's more about I think how you deploy that capital and the returns you're able to generate. And I think one of the reasons why, as you point out, we're seeing potential big restructurings on the European side is that even without the SIFI charge potential that we have in the United States \u2013 and who knows what they'll do over time, maybe the playing field will be completely level \u2013 they're struggling in those businesses at current capital levels. (30:35).</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Now, our commitment to Europe is very significant. And it's not just across the capital intensive businesses, but it's the entire integration of banking. And when you think about Europe over the next several years as they work through what is \u2013 our research folks have them at 1.5% growth, but as they work themselves more and more away from the crisis, this is a very good environment for a firm like Goldman Sachs where clients need sound advice across all of our businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yup. No, I get that. All right. Hey, thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hey, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hey, Mike. How are you?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Good. You ended your prepared remarks saying the world changed in 2008, you cut costs, you implemented regulation and the implication is others are now catching up, implying a little more bit rational pricing, which you've said on prior calls. Can you just give us a description of the areas where you're seeing the biggest repricing or the areas that you're watching the most?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So it's a great question, Mike. And I think it's very clear at this stage that the increased regulatory requirements, however you think about them, but let's just think mostly in terms of capital, while obviously very good for the system and significant improvement for all firms. For example, Goldman Sachs was carrying 85% more capital than we did prior to the crisis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">As we said, they have leveled the playing field a bit, but even without the leveling of the playing field, it makes balance sheet at one point, depending on the metric, and capital itself more expensive. And so, I don't know if it's an intended or unintended consequence in terms of the regulation, but the regulation does reprice things. And the vast majority of the industry is really a handful of us that are earning above the cost of capital, whatever you want to call it \u2013 8%, 9%, 10%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And so we're starting to see repricing come through now. We saw it mostly in balance sheet. Came a little slower than we would've liked, but it's starting to come through in balance sheet. By balance sheet I mean things like those businesses that were maybe most mispriced relative to the new requirements. Things like the repo business, it's extended into the prime brokerage business. Again, that's a regulatory heavy business. We're world-class in that business, but it is regulatory heavy business. And you have seen it in parts of the derivative business particularly in things like those transactions requiring or not requiring collateral. So I'd say it's slow. These are not huge needle movers, but this feels like a trend that's in place for a number of years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So would you call this as an increase in your cost of goods sold that you're passing on to customers?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I think that's probably a reasonable way to say it. I mean our clients are very sophisticated. And when you sit down with them and you say, listen, everyone in the industry, Mike, that issues preferred they are issuing them slightly north of 5%. That's expensive shareholder capital to fund the leverage of your balance sheet. And so, it's pretty easy to explain to people how actually the returns that you have to require on business. And so what we think will happen over time is potentially repricing, but also the competitive dynamic looks like one where those firms that can't deliver or can't respond or don't have the same quality franchise, they get removed. But anyway, this is going to be a \u2013 this will be a long process. We went through a pretty substantial repricing as you know (34:17) last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And last follow up on this. Can you give a sense of magnitude? Are we talking basis point or tens of basis points or what?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Too soon to quantify. As I said, this is not big needle moving. It's more, I would describe it more as a trend for the balance sheet and capital intensive parts of the business. And you'd expect it given the regulatory constraints, so.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">All right. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thanks, Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research US LP</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yeah, good morning. I don't want to beat a dead horse, but on the litigation question, the litigation charge, presumably to add that much based on the Working Group issues that you referred to, there must have been an event, a point in your discussions with them that began to give you a sense for a figure. And I was just wondering if that's a correct assumption?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And also does your view of kind of the your \u2013 where your litigation reserve stands now relative to what you will ultimately need, is that affected in anyway by the New York Court of Appeals judgment on statute of limitations which came down during the quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So again, and I'd like to share more with you but obviously this is active discussion. With respect to this quarter, again, every quarter we incorporate all the information we have, Guy. And obviously we received information that resulted in us taking this charge. I know you've looked and you've read all of our financial disclosures in the past. And so I would encourage you to go back to that. But as you know, based on that we have not historically taken reserves for the RMBS Working Group. And so obviously we got information during the course of the quarter that led to this realization.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research US LP</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then on, just to follow up on an answer that you gave earlier. That 1% that you gave in terms of the G-SIB buffer, which I think what you were saying was that is your working assumption as to how much would go into the CCAR, sort of the increase, the stress minimum in CCAR. Is that right? So you're thinking that 1% out of your 2.5% G-SIB buffer is how much you think is likely to get added to the stress minimum in CCAR?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So, again, the 1% was based on the preliminary. We'll have to see the final rule, so I really want to emphasize that. In terms of CCAR, we just don't know how they're going to include it, what they will do, whether it will be offset. We have no visibility and we'll all hear when the Federal Reserve announces any changes that they plan to make.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research US LP</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. Fair enough. And then just one more if I might just on the SLR. You made a lot of progress on your SLR in the quarter relative to where your core equity tier 1 ratios moved. So you are now 70 basis points ahead of the minimum. You increased 40 basis points in the quarter. Can you give a sense of some of the things that you did presumably to the denominator to continue to tighten up there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yeah, so on the SLR, the 70 basis points, if you break that down, roughly 20 basis points really comes from capital and the issuance of preferred and then the balance are all things that drive the ratio, things like notional (38:10), collateral back and forth and things like derivative. And so, there's a lot of give and gets in there but accretive for the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research US LP</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. Great. Thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Hey. Good morning, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Morning, Jim.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Maybe just circling back to equities in China, we've had a \u2013 obviously as you pointed out, a big selloff and most of you and your peers have talking about equities being driven by strength in Asia. Have you seen any change in the environment and activity levels given the big selloff, or has that just helped \u2013 the volatility helped? Just trying to think through how that should be thought of going forward in terms of the equity franchise.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So again, whenever you see these kind of market reactions, obviously, it has some impact in terms of how clients think through their portfolios. It's more isolated, obviously, to the onshore market. And I think that \u2013 at this stage, I would describe it as being pretty fluid and dynamic with respect to the near term.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I think longer term, what we're really focused on is the extent to which the recent events, do they really have a significant negative impact from an economic perspective or in terms of the liberalization policies, because obviously we have a very big focus on China, a big commitment there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And our early read of all this is that it's not going to have a big \u2013 when we talk to our research folks, it's not going to have a big impact on the local economy, and we don't expect a major change in sort of the focus on liberalization. And given everything China's done, maybe we should expect as they go through this, there were (39:51) going to be growing pains from year to year, but the long term trend feels okay to us. From a...</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yeah, that's \u2013 okay. That's helpful. And maybe just circling back to the \u2013 I know it's early days on the lending side, but historically, you guys have shied away from retail risk, right, with regulatory and higher legal risk. This seems to be a bit of a departure from that historical viewpoint. So could you maybe just walk us through your \u2013 clearly there's an opportunity to make money, but the question is how you view the potentially higher risk in a retail lending format?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yeah. So we've always been very cautious, and you're right to point that out. Now we do have millions of clients that touch us in our investment management business through our mutual funds every day. And so they're actually a big part of what we do. And when we think about it, obviously, we're going to move very cautiously in the space and make sure we get things right, because you're right to point out that, like any new business, there are risks and we want to make sure that we work with the consumers and the regulators in absolutely a first-class and best-class way. And so \u2013 but again, too early for us to identify any specific parts of the market. But we'll be back to you with more details again down the road.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. Great. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Good morning, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Hey. Good morning, Brennan.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So first question, you made some reference to it earlier when you talked a little bit about pricing, but it looks like we're seeing some momentum in your Prime Brokerage business. Clearly, the current quarter was a bit seasonal. But could you give some color to that? Is some of it down to pricing? Is it down to other factors? Maybe, could you help us out a little around there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I really think there's two drivers. The biggest driver is just the quality of the franchise. And so, we've been a beneficiary of getting balances just because of the \u2013 really the longstanding history and our involvement in this business, and it's global for us. But pricing is an important input, but it's not the primary driver of the performance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. Thanks for that. And on I&amp;L, pretty solid, especially given some of the action we saw in markets this quarter. Can you \u2013 was a lot of it harvesting? Were there any particular regions that contributed? For example, was Asia a contributor in the quarter on the I&amp;L line?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So, in terms of I&amp;L, and why don't I just run through it, I can run through it from the debt line through the equity line. So in the debt line we had $547 million, roughly $550 million in revenues in the quarter. And remember, I underscore for you there that roughly $225 million of that is interest income, okay, and the rest is gains in sales.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">In the equity line, of the $1.25 billion, roughly a third of that actually comes from public market shares that we own, in entities we've already taken public. And so there you're just seeing the idiosyncratic performance of the portfolio. And another third \u2013 and I'll just break it down for you in thirds \u2013 a third is the public portfolio performance. A third is things that we refer to as event-driven, like actually taking a company public or making a sale, and the other third is performance-driven. And so the idiosyncratic nature of the portfolio, the team is just doing a very good job here.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Terrific. Thanks for that color, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian M. Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Great. Thank you. Hey, Harvey, earlier you mentioned that you saw that liquidity was challenged in parts of the market when you were talking about the FICC business. Can you give a little bit further color as to maybe what regions and which products that we saw the liquidity dry up?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So, it was most challenging in Europe. The credit market in particular, and let's just say the spread sensitive product, the markets aren't as deep there, obviously, as they are in the United States. And then, with all the issues with Greece, liquidity was quite challenging for all of our clients, and quite challenging for market makers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian M. Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. And then also in Europe, are you impacted by the UK bank tax and the higher \u2013 it looked like \u2013 if you look at the Goldman Sachs International?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yeah, so it's an important part of our business, obviously, given our presence in Europe. Too early for me to quantify anything for you, but obviously the tax rate's going up over there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian M. Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">But is that $2 billion that you had in profit on ordinary activity before taxes in Goldman Sachs International the right number to look at when you're thinking about the potential impact on tax rates?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I have to come back to you on that in terms of exactly the number you look at. I believe the answer to that is yes, but why don't I have Dane follow up with you, and we'll make sure we reconcile that for you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian M. Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Great. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question is from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Thanks very much. Harvey, a couple of follow-ups, please. On your non-comp, core non-comp expenses, it looks like they came in under the consensus estimate by about $120 million this quarter. Should we consider all of that improvement to be core, or did some of it perhaps relate to slowing volume or activity over the course of the period?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">No, not driven by slowing activity. Any changes in non-comp that you're seeing away, obviously, from the legacy charge, that would have to do with impairments that we might take from time-to-time, is the real driver there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. And in terms of the incentive fees in the Investment Management segment, I'm sorry if I missed this earlier, but did you explain why they were so strong in this quarter, because that's not typically seasonally the case?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yeah. So there's always two drivers to incentive fees. There's going to be the normal or what we'll call year-end incentive fees that you're used to seeing. And then there are fund specific events where we've above a certain performance metric and then we'll begin to recognize those fees. And so this is very fund specific in terms of this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. And just lastly, one of the metrics that we, and I imagine others use to gain some insight into the M&amp;A outlook is the index of CEO Confidence which has been generally moving in a straight line up until recently where it took a dip down. I'm guessing may be because of Greece and other macro events, but I'm wondering does that index accurately reflect the tenor of conversations that you've been having with \u2013 in corporate board rooms over the past few weeks?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So when we talk to our M&amp;A bankers, the momentum in the advisor side of the business feels very strong. The CEOs and boards are obviously going to incorporate all the relevant news and so not surprising to me that when you see Greece dominating the headlines and lots of volatility in the markets that you might see some dip in confidence. But in terms of the degree of conversations we're having in the activity levels, it feels quite good. And you see that halfway through the year, in announced transactions, the Investment Banking team is actually we have announced $112 billion plus of transactions, actually more than the next competitor. And so the dialogue for us with our clients is pretty robust right now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. Thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question is from the line of Richard Bove with Rafferty Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Richard Bove - Rafferty Capital Markets, LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Good morning, Dick.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Richard Bove - Rafferty Capital Markets, LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Hi. This is more of an accounting question. Basically, your Investment Banking was up quarter-over-quarter, commissions and fees were up, your principal transactions were up, and obviously there was a big jump in your debt underwriting. And yet there was almost a $200 million drop in your net interest income. And I'm just wondering why that would be? what are the accounting recognition that would allow that to happen?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yeah. So you're looking at the GAAP income statement, Dick, obviously. And that has a lot to do with under the GAAP rules, how we have to treat certain hedges versus the portfolios. We have to break out certain hedges and move them into the market making business. So it ends up being a net offset.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Richard Bove - Rafferty Capital Markets, LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I see. So this is interest income loss on hedging?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">(48:48) The hedges are hedging parts of the portfolio, so you might get a decrease in the underlying, for example, the income being driven by the portfolio, but then you pick it up in the hedges offsetting that portfolio in the market making business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Richard Bove - Rafferty Capital Markets, LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. But the market making in the FICC side of the business was down 49% so...</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Correct. That may be completely unrelated to the interest component. That's why in the script, Dick, I break out for you in the investing and lending segment, that net interest income was $225 million in the lending businesses to try and clarify it. I'm happy to have Dane walk you through it but it's an accounting aspect.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Richard Bove - Rafferty Capital Markets, LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. And then the second question would be, basically, I understand trading is not totally related to underwriting, but when you have such an incredibly strong increase in underwriting of a certain segment like that, and at the same point in time the FICC income goes down fairly substantially, it would suggest that what you're underwriting is something that isn't traded?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">No, I wouldn't draw that conclusion. Usually the secondary activity flows for a long period of time, Dick. I think it's hard to draw those kind of conclusions in an individual quarter. I think if you look at our that debt underwriting activity in the first quarter, it wasn't as strong as the second quarter, but yet the FICC results were stronger. And so, if you look at FICC, for example, on a year-to-date basis, it's down. But the second quarter was definitely tougher for us, Dick.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Richard Bove - Rafferty Capital Markets, LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. All right. Thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Hi. Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Morning, Steve.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So, Harvey, given the challenging market making backdrop that you experienced in 2Q, I was wondering how that informed your thinking around the issue of trading liquidity more broadly. And I might be interested in hearing some of your thoughts regarding the recent feedback that we've heard from regulators as well as some of the results based on their recently-conducted studies.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So, obviously, there has been a whole host of discussion around liquidity in the markets. And I think in the end, I think it leaves us quite frankly all with more questions more than answers. I think you can point to some very specific parts of the market where you can say regulation has impacted liquidity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I think, the best example of that is the government bond repo market. I think it's hard after that to point to a specific regulation and say, oh, this regulation has impacted liquidity in this market. That doesn't mean it's not happening. I think it's just hard to quantify. I think the repo market you can easily quantify it. You can see the reduction in repo commitment from various banks, including ourselves, and you can see over quarter-end how repo spreads react.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">By the way, to me that looks like that's an intended desire by the regulators. They wanted people to either reprice or shrink that business. And so I think away from that the reason why this is difficult is because it's a question of really what is the multi-year accumulation of regulation?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Things being pushed more electronically, inability to hold as much balance sheet, increasing RWAs, all these things so vocal. But I think these things reveal themselves over many years. But obviously, you can't have as much regulation as we've had and not have some unintended consequences. I think it's just the cost of regulation. Doesn't mean the regulation is not good.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Understood. And maybe just switching gears for a moment. Just wanted to dig into some your comments that you made on the debt underwriting side. You cited strong DCM really driven by higher leverage finance activity, which is certainly a nice surprise just given some of the regulatory pressures in that area. I wanted to get a better sense of how you're thinking about the outlook for the business more broadly. And one of the questions we hear most often is whether the recent pickup in activity is more tactical driven versus a reflection of what could be sustained strength in that business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So, you're right to ask that question and the question's been coming up for the last couple years, obviously, as we've gone through this part of the cycle with tighter credit spreads and lower rates. And we talked about this. If the M&amp;A cycle remains strong, then obviously that will be a positive tailwind to the underwriting business. And it was for us. When I said leverage finance activity, I could have said leverage finance activity facilitated in part by our advisory business. So if the M&amp;A backdrop continues the way it feels today \u2013 but I think M&amp;A will help.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">All right. That's it for me. Thanks for taking my questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thanks, Steven. Take care.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Hey. Thanks. Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Morning, Devin.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Most have been asked and answered, but just a question on the market volatility. We hear the term healthy volatility versus unhealthy volatility in the market. So can you help us think about what you think could drive that healthy volatility that seem to be missing? It seems like every time we have one of these macro flare-ups, like Greece as an example, we just see more extreme market moves which I think would be put in the unhealthy bucket. So any perspective there would be appreciated.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I think in an effort to overly simplify this, I think healthy volatility is volatility in which client activity picks up and liquidity exists, clients feel confident. Unhealthy volatility is the reverse of that where clients get more conservative and they derisk. And so as we go through these periods, the general trend, obviously, feels like volatility is picking up in a healthy way, but that doesn't mean from time to time we're not going to hit these kind of pockets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. Got it. And then just secondly, on debt underwriting again, not to beat a dead horse, but just given the strength there, and speaking to the leverage finance market, do you feel like you're gaining market share there doing transactions that maybe others are moving away from, or does it just feel like you're benefiting with the rising tide as M&amp;A is picking up?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yeah, no, there's nothing we're doing. We're being pretty conservative in terms of our thought process in terms of the business. And our risk-taking is being very prudent. It really is all about M&amp;A activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Again, as I mentioned to you, I talked about at the announce (55:42), but when you look at the completed lead tables (55:44), obviously, our team is really in the center of all the M&amp;A dialogs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yup. Got it. Thanks, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">At this time there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. Since there are no more questions, I just want to take a moment to thank all of you for joining the call. Hopefully I and other members of senior management will see many of you in the coming months. If any additional questions arise, please feel free to reach out to Dane, otherwise enjoy the rest of your day, and I look forward to speaking with you on our third quarter call in October. Take care, everyone.

My name is Dennis, and I\u2019ll be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today, October 15, 2015. Thank you. Mr. Holmes, you may begin your conference.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Dane Holmes</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Today\u2019s call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm\u2019s belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain and outside of the firm\u2019s control. The firm\u2019s actual results and financial condition may differ possibly materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">For discussion of some of the risk and factors that could affect the firm\u2019s future results, please see the description of risk factors in our current Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, global core liquid assets, and supplementary leverage ratio. And you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that\u2019s posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com. This audiocast is copyrighted material to Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Our Chief Financial Officer, Harvey Schwartz, will now review the firm\u2019s results. Harvey?</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thanks, Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I\u2019ll walk you through the third quarter and year-to-date results, and I\u2019m happy to answer any questions. Net revenues were $6.9 billion. Net earnings $1.4 billion. Earnings per diluted share $2.90, and our annualized return on common equity was 7%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">For the year-to-date, net revenues were $26.5 billion. Net earnings $5.3 billion. Earnings per diluted share $10.84, and our return \u2013 our annualized return on common equity was 8.8%. Book value per share is up 5% relative to year-end 2014, despite recording net provisions for litigation and regulatory matters, up $2.1 billion for the year-to-date. These provisions largely from legacy issues reduced our annualized return on common equity for the first nine months of the year by approximately 3 percentage points.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Moving to the third quarter, parts of our franchise performed quite well, while others operated against a more challenging backdrop. Our M&amp;A franchise continued to deliver robust results and our outlook remains positive. We continue to see net inflows in our investment management business. Of course, they\u2019re the usual seasonal drivers due to the summer slowdown, but in addition the third quarter also had more than its fair share of significant macroeconomic developments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Both the Chinese economy and the country\u2019s monetary policy came into focus. Our clients evaluated the potential implications of a slowing Chinese economy, the decision by the People\u2019s Bank of China to devalue its currency, and the resulting volatility in global markets. As it relates to the U.S. economy, our clients remain focused on the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate policy. Over the course of the third quarter, client\u2019s expectations for an interest rate hike began to shift. Mixed economic indicators drove uncertainty about the pace of U.S. economic growth. Ultimately, there was doubt about the timing and magnitude of the future rate increase.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Another significant macroeconomic theme in the third quarter, commodities. Prices fell across a number of different products. WTI was down 24%. Copper and natural gas were both down approximately 10%. The price slump let the market to focus on the credit risk of commodity producers, trading houses, and those economies with significant commodity exports. These concerns drove an increase in credit spreads, particularly across the energy sector. The sum impact of these various events led to lower levels of client activity and a significant repricing of the equity and credit markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">The S&amp;P was down nearly 7%, the MSCI world was down almost 10%, and the Shanghai Composite was down close to 30%. In the credit markets, European high yield spreads were 107 basis points wider and U.S. high yield spreads were 153 basis points wider. Not surprisingly, we produced lower quarterly revenues across many of our businesses, given both declining asset prices and reduced level of client activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Now, I will discuss each of our businesses. Investment Banking produced third quarter revenues of $1.6 billion, 23% lower than a strong second quarter as underwriting slowed. Although issuance declined during the quarter, our Investment Banking backlog remains strong and was up compared to both the second quarter and the end of 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Breaking down the components of Investment Banking in the quarter, advisory revenues were $809 million, roughly consistent with the second quarter. Year-to-date, Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced and completed M&amp;A. During this period, we served as an advisor on nearly $900 billion of completed transactions. This is roughly $350 billion more than our next closest competitor. We advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the third quarter, including DirecTV\u2019s $67.1 billion sale to AT&amp;T, eBay\u2019s $46.8 billion spin-off of PayPal, and Baxter\u2019s $20.3 billion spin-off of Baxalta.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We also advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the third quarter. These include Energy Transfer Equity\u2019s $37.7 billion acquisition of the Williams Companies, Humana\u2019s $37 billion sale to Aetna, and Procter &amp; Gamble\u2019s $12.5 billion merger of its beauty business into Coty.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Moving to underwriting, revenues were $747 million in the third quarter, down 38% sequentially, primarily due to a significant decline in equity issuance. Although global activity was weaker, our franchise remains strong with a number one ranking in global equity and equity related and common stock offerings for the year-to-date.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Equity underwriting revenues were $190 million. This was down substantially compared to the second quarter, due to a decrease of industry wide IPOs and secondary offerings, as higher volatility and a decline in prices reduced activity. Debt underwriting revenues of $557 million were down 8% quarter-over-quarter, a decrease of industry wide issuance volumes was partially offset by acquisition related financing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">During the third quarter, we actively supported our client\u2019s financing needs leading HP Enterprises $14.6 billion debt offering related to a spin-off from HP, Biogen\u2019s $6 billion debt offering, and Simporno\u2019s [ph] $1.4 billion rights offering.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our fixed and equities businesses. Net revenues were $3.2 billion in the third quarter, down a 11% compared to the second quarter. Within the number of our businesses, the macro concerns I have already talked about impacted both client conviction and activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">FICC Client Execution net revenues were $1.5 billion in the third quarter and included a $147 million of DVA gains. Net revenues were down 9% from the second quarter and market-making conditions continue to be challenging.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Currencies improved sequentially, as the devaluation in the Chinese yuan sparked significant client activity within our emerging market franchise. Commodities increased relative to a more challenging second quarter, as declining commodity prices and higher volatility benefited results.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Interest rates was significantly lower, as uncertainty related to the direction of U.S. interest rates impacted activity. Credit decreased, as client activity remains generally low amid continued spread widening. Mortgages was significantly lower as conditions remained challenged with limited client activity. In equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees and security services, net revenues for the third quarter were $1.8 billion, down 12% quarter-over-quarter and included $35 million in DVA gains. Equities\u2019 client execution net revenues decreased 29% sequentially to $555 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Broadly speaking, client activity declined versus the second quarter, as higher volatility and global equity market weakness impacted investor conviction and risk appetite. However, as is often the case in more volatile markets, we did see activity pickup in our lower touch electronic channels, as a result commissions and fees were up 7% quarter-over-quarter to $818 million. Security services generated net revenues of $379 million, down 14%, compared to the seasonally stronger second quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to risk, despite an increase in volatility, average daily bar in the third quarter was down $3 million sequentially to $74 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Moving onto our investing and lending activities, collectively these businesses produced net revenues of $670 million in the third quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of $370 million. The declining global equity markets negatively impacted net revenues and public equities during the quarter. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $300 million with the majority coming from net interest income.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">The Investment Management reported third quarter net revenues of $1.4 billion, down 14%, excuse me, 14% from the second quarter, as incentive fees declined. Management and other fees were down 3% sequentially to $1.2 billion. Assets under supervision reached a record $1.19 trillion, as long-term net inflows more than offset market depreciation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">With respect to long-term flows, organic net inflows were strong at $23 billion. We also closed the Pacific Global Advisors acquisition during the quarter, which added $18 billion of assets. This represents our 7th acquisition since the beginning of 2012. Over that timeframe, total long-term net inflows were $195 billion. $71 billion of these net flows came from acquisitions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Moving to performance across the global platform, 72% of our client mutual fund assets were in funds ranked in the top two quartiles on a three-year basis, and 70% in funds ranked in the top two quartiles on a five-year basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Now, let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior-year equity awards and other items such as benefits was accrued at a compensation to net revenues ratio of 40% for the year-to-date. This is 200 basis points lower than the firm\u2019s accrual in the first-half of this year and consistent with the year-to-date compensation ratio at the end of the third quarter of 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Third quarter non-compensation expenses were 30% lower than the second quarter. Substantially all the decrease was driven by a larger litigation charge taken in the second quarter. In the third quarter, net provisions for litigation and regulatory expenses were $416 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Now, I\u2019d like to take you through a few key statistics for the third quarter. Total staff increased by 2,000 to approximately 36,900, which was up 6% quarter-over-quarter. Roughly half of the new staff was from the federation, largely technology and operations. The other half was primarily spread across Investment Banking and Investment Management. The increase was dominated by campus hires and reflects both the activity levels in certain businesses and our continued investment in regulatory compliance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Our effective tax rate for the year-to-date was 31%. Our global core liquid assets averaged $193 billion during the quarter. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 12.4% using the Standardized approach, it was 12.7% under the Basel III Advanced approach. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 5.8%. And finally, we repurchased 5.4 million shares of common stock for $1.1 billion in the third quarter. As we have discussed related to our share repurchase capacity, any potential share repurchases over the next three quarters will be more back-end weighted compared to the last two quarters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Before we turn to Q&amp;A, I\u2019ll share some thoughts around the market and industry broadly. The third quarter served as a reminder of the fragility and sensitivity of markets, investor sentiment, and the path to strong global economic growth. As you know over the last several years, the financial services industry has faced a series of headwinds. These pressures have forced many within the industry to rethink their footprint or their level of commitment to a variety of businesses, particularly within the more capital intensive businesses of fixed income, currencies, and commodities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">At Goldman Sachs, our strategy remains intact to be the leading advisor, underwriter, liquidity provider, financier, and investment manager. To that end, we are always looking for ways to deliver more differentiated value to our clients. We\u2019re also keenly aware of the challenges facing the industry. While some of our businesses are experiencing year-to-date growth, for example, Investment Banking and Investment Management, other parts of the business are in a more difficult part of the cycle.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">However, we\u2019re hardly complacence. For example, within FICC, we are proactively responded to industry wide challenges, including asset sales, expense initiatives, and balance sheet reduction. The goal of these various efforts is to maintain margins, improve returns, prudently manage risk, and protect the global client franchise. We will always look for additional opportunities to improve our FICC operations. However, we will also never lose sight of the tremendous value that we can bring to our FICC clients over the long term.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In closing, we believe that our long-term prospects are quite favorable. Our global pipe franchise, it\u2019s as strong as ever. Our lead table rankings and track record of superior returns are a byproduct of that strength. In addition, we have the people, the risk culture, the embedded operating leverage and clarity of purpose to deliver superior value to you, our shareholders, particularly as the environment improves.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Thank you, again, for dialing in. And I\u2019m happy to answer your questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p4\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">[Operator Instructions] Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Hi. Thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Hey, good morning, Glenn.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Good morning. Harvey, Harvey, maybe we pick up where you left off on the whole cyclical versus structural debate in FICC. And I heard everything you said and I think you\u2019re right, and I think you are who you say you\u2019re for your clients. But I look at the backdrop and I say, the Europeans are actually starting to need to adjust their balance sheets and shrink parts of the business. And so the thought of Goldman maintaining is optionality all these years. This would seem like the pay off and yet a pick up in volatility in several asset classes, it feels like actually the world that was coming your way, but yet the revenue reduction for Goldman relative to peers, and I\u2019m not just talking this quarter, last couple of quarters is more pronounced. I\u2019m just trying to do the smell test of all, why is that, because I actually do think that things are lining up that you would be more important to your clients, not less and there would be more opportunities, not less.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So, well, first of all, completely agree with that thesis, maybe let\u2019s back up a little bit. And I think it\u2019s worth having a discussion, because I think the easy way to the have it is sort of break it down into three parts. Let\u2019s just talk about the quarter for a minute. Obviously, it\u2019s a tough quarter for us in fixed income. But if you think about how we\u2019re running the business, I think that\u2019s the more important two parts.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">If you look back over the last several years at the expense initiatives we\u2019ve taken where we have reduced headcount fixed income by more than 10%. We have shrunk the balance sheet by 20%, and if you actually look at it on RWA basis since we switched over to Basel III, we really very softly [ph] managed the capital deployment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So in this part of the cycle, we have been very disciplined about how we managed those resources. Now, of course, your thesis is our thesis, which is we\u2019re in a deep and somewhat long cyclical part of the fixed cycle. But when you think of the forward, our construction simplified is twofold. Our level engagement with our clients tells us clients still need the services. It\u2019s like M&amp;A, Glenn.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">M&amp;A, the services weren\u2019t active in 2009 and 2010, people questioned whether or not M&amp;A would come back. But our dialogue told us that client engagement and the services we provided to the liquidity provider were important. So when we think about the forward and we hear the announcements and we\u2019re in this part of the cycle, but it\u2019s going to take a while for that to transition through, because I think so far it\u2019s been more than announcements than a retrenchment, and you won\u2019t really see it happen in all the steps we\u2019ve taken until you see a pick up in client activity and the competitive environment continue to shift, that may take a while.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">But in the meantime, look, we\u2019ll benefit as a firm, because we would diversify until you saw a pick up in certain part of equities, you\u2019ve seen the strength in banking. But certainly a tougher quarter for us in fixed income this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">May just a last follow-up on the FICC conversation is, how if any, does the new vocal reporting requirements changed? How you managed the business? How you reported? I\u2019m just curious, because we can\u2019t see any of them?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">No chance that we managed the business. Any steps in terms of vocal adoption happened a number of years ago, where we shutdown certain business. And all of the U.S. firms are subject to the same rule set in vocal, so not an issue. I really think it\u2019s a question of client environment. In the third quarter, the environment for all the factors I mentioned was very challenging, it was hard for us. And if we go back to the first quarter the first quarter environment was one with more activity and better performance on our part, but we don\u2019t want to overreact to a particular quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay, I appreciate that. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Thanks, Glenn.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Thanks, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Hi, Michael.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Hi. Just first, you mentioned some of your comments on the commodity, I guess pressures in the quarter. Just wanted to get kind of an update. When you guys look at commodities and that everyone call it asset class. Just how do you view your exposure to that part of the market or the economy? And then, when you look at it from a client base, what has been happening, meaning our \u2013 the clients in those areas lot \u2013 less active, more active, and are you seeing that spread to any other areas of the economy?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So in terms of the exposure, we\u2019re not a big lender to the energy space. I think the best way to characterize it for you is just to take a look at two parts of that. First, any of our funded exposure to non-investment grade parts of the sector, it\u2019s a bit over $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion. And the other sector, which obviously came to focus in the quarter is the trading houses. And we\u2019re less than $200 million in exposure to those trading houses. So they\u2019re not, as I said, we\u2019re not a big lender, not an important part of our business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">In terms of the aggregate impact, in terms of client activity, things have been moving so quickly that sometimes as advantageous to client activity and intensity when things are more trending. I think the whole world is adjusting to basically a longer-term consideration of commodity prices being lower in the intermediate term. And ultimately, that will be a catalyst for activity, as clients considered hedging strategies, as they think about financing alternatives, as clients and companies struggle for refinancing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So lower for longer in commodity prices, while very good for the consumer and the global consumer and the broader economy, which is also a tailwind, certainly, it should be a catalyst for client activity also.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay, thanks. And then just as a follow-up, maybe on capital and the ratios, if you have the CET1, maybe like the fully phased immerse of the transitional, and then just given the decent buffers, just any outlook in terms of where you think you would run that? In the buyback pace, just seemed like it ramped up. I know you guys have been saying, it\u2019s backward weighted, but it just seemed like this quarter was probably a bit sooner than expected. So just wanted to understand, is that because of the movement in the stock or is it just the plan with the CCAR process being pretty normal from what you guys expected?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Yes. So on the capital ratio, so with the G-SIB buffer finalized that what you said 10%, and obviously we have a lot of capacity above that. Our target zone would be 50 to 100 basis points above that. If you\u2019re just looking at that set of metrics and obviously our supplementary leverage ratios in very good shape at 58, but CCARs are binding constraints. And so, at least, it has been.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">In terms of the share repurchase capacity and what we\u2019ll do, obviously as you know, we don\u2019t disclose that, we don\u2019t disclose it for the very simple fact that we don\u2019t want our shareholders to think of share repurchase as dividends. And we also reserve and really look forward to actually deploying the capital back into the business. Now, in terms of the mechanics of what is possible part of the profile that you saw over the last two quarters certainly dictated by the specifics of the test. But to an extent, which we use the capacity over the next three quarters, as I said in my early remarks, you should expect it to be more back-end weighted than you\u2019ve seen in the prior two. Does that helpful?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. And \u2013 yes. And then just to see if you want, if you had the fully phased in, and I think you guys gave the transitional?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So on Standardized or are you talking Advanced?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">I think if you have both, but Advanced probably more\u2026</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">[indiscernible] began. So on a transitional advanced 12.7%, fully phased in 11.9%, on Standardized 12.4%, and fully phased 11.7%. So as I said a lot of capacity over our 10% minimum and our operating range of 10.5% to a 11%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Got it. Thanks a lot.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay<strong>.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Your next question is from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Hey, Chris, good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Mr. Christian, check your phone to see if your line is on mute, sir?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Hello, good morning. Can you hear me now?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Yes, sure.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Yes, sorry by that. I will ask the FICC question of another way, as it\u2019s a focus of investor this morning. I guess, three of the last four quarters, performances lagged peers. How do you rationalize this? Is it a business mix or customer mix issue? And then looking forward just a bear market backdrop, or is there any proactive steps you can take to improve performance?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Well, there\u2019s always things we can do better, we\u2019re not perfect. So we always look at them. Christian, we don\u2019t see as much value in comparing revenues certainly revenues quarter-to-quarter movements, but we certainly study them and we look for any valuable insights. But I think if you really look to the quarter-to-quarter noise, you run the risk of over steering the business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So, for example, in the first quarter, we didn\u2019t glean huge value out of that in terms of comparing competitors, I don\u2019t know how much value we\u2019ll get out of this quarter. So we don\u2019t have a lot of visibility into their businesses. Our focus has to be on a hand of things, most importantly, our client engagements, and then our profit margins, the risk management, and the ultimate returns. And so that\u2019s really what we\u2019ll focus on. In fact, now it\u2019s interesting, because you brought up the issue of volatility of revenues, and I make a couple of important points.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">If you look over the years, revenues don\u2019t really tell a great story. And as a shareholder, if you want a collection of businesses, and if you actually look at our performance, consistency of ROE, and returns and earnings, we\u2019re the most stable. And so it really is about from wide earnings, not revenues. Anyway I don\u2019t know if that helps you or not.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Yes, no, that helps, and thanks for the clarifications. Maybe just a broader question on pricing power in the business. I guess, what lessons have you learned from the price increases implemented in the prime brokerage business from what we can see revenue generation has not suffered at all for any of the top players. Maybe does that tell you that the industry has more leverage in pricing, and maybe can we expect this and other business to maybe offset some of the weaker activity trends?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So I think there\u2019s two things driving. Your first is a question of really strength of franchise. And we\u2019ve had a long, long history of being a dominant player in the prime brokerage business, and I think it really is the value proposition that we offer our clients globally, that is the differential in that business. I think the capital rules, as they come into play and the balance sheet impact of those capital rules in the class has forced a very natural repricing in terms of how much balance sheet we and the industry can provide the clients. And clients are being very judicious about that, but they\u2019re also been making a differentiated judgment about who the best value providers are, and we\u2019re certainly one of those. And so we\u2019re seeing pricing power.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And any other businesses you think you can accept that pricing power?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So, certainly in as we talked about in the past from time-to-time when activity has picked up, I don\u2019t know necessarily, I would call it pricing power as much as I would call it an absence of competition. But certainly in the commodity space several quarters ago, there was a lot of activity where certainly competition, which if you want to call that pricing power, I think of it a little bit differently. But certainly clients were going to engage us differently. And then in the derivative businesses globally, as you\u2019re seeing firms exit parts of the CDS business and other parts of the equity derivative businesses, I think it\u2019s early days, but certainly you\u2019re seeing a reduction in competition, and that translates into pricing power or maybe better said better returns.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thanks, Christian.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question is from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hey, Matt.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O\u2019Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Actually first is the quick follow-up to that very last comment you made about some repricing in parts of equity derivatives. I just I haven\u2019t heard that before. Maybe I haven\u2019t been paying attention. But what areas there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So it\u2019s really two parts we\u2019ve seen some of it in Europe where competition used to be sort of more significant, but also given the requirements around collateral worlds and things like that where you may have at times had marginal participants actually pricing that levels where we would have thought the risk return didn\u2019t make sense. Now you\u2019re seeing more rational and improved pricing I\u2019d say that\u2019s a general trend.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O\u2019Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. And then just separately, can you give us an update on the bank deposit and lending strategy. You obviously announced a deal to acquire some deposits and have had a key hire in the lending side I think in the second quarter. So just give us an update on what you are thinking there and will we see this business grow to be meaningful at some point?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Sure, great question. And the way the first thing I will emphasize on that question is really the separation between a liability strategy, and potential asset strategy. So these two things are completely separate, but I think it\u2019s natural that people would link them.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">The online deposit strategy, where we requested approval for the deposit platform that really is all about funding diversification we have spent sometime contemplating building our own platform this platform became available, it seemed attractive and timely for us and for GE. And so, but we would do that independently of any asset driven strategy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Now, in terms of the digitally led lending strategy, which you talked about is not a lot to update you on since we last talked. We\u2019re thrilled to have Harvey on board as our partner, he brings a wealth of knowledge and we feel like there is a handful of reasons why we maybe able to have an impact on this space here.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">One our real core competencies, and risk management, and technology. And we feel like we maybe able to provide a differentiated product that is accretive to the firms current returns, but it\u2019s going to be slow going obviously, we built lots of business at Goldman Sachs this is a new business. Again it\u2019s great to have Harvey here, because he brings all the expertise\u2019s and when we have more to talk you about we\u2019ll certainly update you, but it\u2019s going to be very deliberate in terms of its development.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O\u2019Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And I guess just a quick follow-up, on the funding side, as we think about the deposits growing over time, is that something that will benefit you in down turns or is it also something that will benefit the earnings incrementally from lower funding costs?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I think it\u2019s too twofold I mean, we have always been very conservative about our liquidity profile and a part of being conservative is about being diversified and so we\u2019re always looking for diversification I\u2019m always looking for cost-effectiveness. But when we think about liability management, again it it\u2019s really about making sure we have the strongest financial footings at any given point of time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O\u2019Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay, thanks for taking my questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Hi, good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Hey, Betsy, how are you?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Good. So, just a question about how you think about your market share. As you indicated, revenues were tough way to measure things, because people have different positions and marks, et cetera. So, I\u2019m interested in understanding how you think about how you are doing on market share, really from a transaction side. I know you talk about client engagement. So thinking that from a transaction perspective ignoring the P&amp;L impact where do you think you stand in your various businesses?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So, I know you\u2019re asking me question narrowly, but in terms of running those businesses and particularly FICC, it really is multipart. So our client engagements in the businesses that we\u2019re focused on feels quite good. So for example we\u2019re not the biggest emerging markets firm as you know, because we don\u2019t have offices in hundred countries and it\u2019s never been the biggest part of our footprint there are certainly always things that we\u2019re focused on and if you think about our client base, we\u2019re more skewed I think, because we\u2019re not the biggest lender in the globe, we\u2019re more skewed to professional money managers and investors and you saw and you could see their activity moves around.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">But we feel good about our client engagements and our market shares, but it\u2019s a multi-part question is \u2013 it\u2019s not just about clients although they\u2019re the most important part and running these businesses, it really is about margins returns over the long-term.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay then separately on the INL space last quarter you gave a very helpful dissection of a third, a third, a third in terms of revenue flows that were a function of public marks versus not so public versus private. Do you have any kind of breakdown on how the quarter was impacted by that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Sure, so let\u2019s just maybe step back. So at the end of the second quarter the INL balance sheet was $89 billion and roughly 75% of that is debt related. So the balance really equity related and then it breaks out.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">But the breakout I gave you last time really was public equities, which were down and they [part 11 1: 41]more or less in line with global markets and they started $4 billion at the quarter and so certainly there was just the path to mark-to-market.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And then in private equity the vast majority of the performance that offset the public portfolio was event related and by event related I mean sales, pending sales IPOs. And we really benefited from the idiosyncratic nature of the portfolio. We\u2019re not large for example in some of the hardest hit sectors like energy and that kind of stuff.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. Thanks, very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question is from a line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Hi.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Hi Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Questions on trading both equities, and fixed income. What percent is electronic or automated and has that compared to five years ago. And then the second question is, kind of what percent of the business would you say pricing is more rational than it\u2019s been in the past?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So, on the second part I\u2019d say it\u2019s the trend is improving in terms of rational pricing, but it\u2019s in a market where the client engagement from quarter-to-quarter has been very different right, so we saw it in the first quarter, we saw less in second quarter I think that I would answer the electronic trading question as sort of long-term.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">The secular trend, which has been in place long before the crisis, that just continues and to some extent is aided by the creation of SEPs and things. This quarter what we\u2019ve seen in the past, what we saw in this quarter where when volatility is quite severe particularly in the equity markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Clients really look to de-risk or add risk and they tend to trade electronically, so I would say it\u2019s a trend, but I don\u2019t have the specific numbers for you Mike, in terms of the quarter contribution of electronic versus cash, but we can certainly get to that stuff.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I think, can you just give even a ballpark. If electronic 5%, 10%, 20%, 50% just any sort of ballpark figure?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Well, I don\u2019t want to guess on a ballpark, certainly in the third quarter there was a meaningful pick up in electronic activity relative to cash in the equities business and again I don\u2019t want to guess at a number for you Mike, we\u2019ll be happy to get you one.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Sure, and then just a follow-up on the pricing. What areas in particular are you seeing the best pricing improvement in trading?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So, I\u2019d say balance sheet intensive business is broadly and that really is as firms globally around the world adjust capital requirements and have to be more thoughtful about the marginal deployment of balance sheet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And then other things, that are potentially balance sheet consumers like longer dated derivatives swaps and certainly when commodities has picked up, we have seen circumstances where and this is obviously augmented by the fact that their trading houses have gone through some pretty significant pressure now. What we\u2019re saying reduce competition, but again it\u2019s harder to see it certainly translate through unless the client activity levels are high. I think that\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing this big back and forth swing between a quarter like the first quarter where we had a 14.7% ROE and in this quarter we have a much tougher quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">All right. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Thanks, Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I just wanted to follow-up a little bit first on the composition of the change in revenues in equities and FICC from the second to the third quarter in FICC you alluded I think to rates first off as having contributed significantly, and then you mentioned credit and mortgages, was that kind of the ordering of the degree to, which they impacted the revenue move?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Mortgages, was a bigger driver if you\u2019re doing year-over-year comparables.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Right. But I mean for the second quarter to third quarter shift?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Mortgages remain challenged. The biggest driver was interest rates and then followed by mortgages.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. So the widening of credit spreads that was actually pretty significant in the quarter didn\u2019t really \u2013 it wasn\u2019t as impactful overall on FICC as just what was going on in rates and mortgages?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes, we saw it more in those two businesses, but it was still challenging obviously for credit markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And then really to the same question for equity, you\u2019ve talked in the release on a year-over-year basis about cash versus derivatives. But can you talk about, as you move from second to third quarter, what was driving the change in client execution?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So, it\u2019s pretty straightforward. Obviously, lots of volatility in Asia, which had an impact on the entire market structure in terms of global market responded. But basically there instead of the shift I talked about earlier, tougher market conditions in Asia and then a shift to electronic activity, which boosted commissions and fees.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Got it. And then just final question, which I think is going to relate to I&amp;L, in the release you alluded to a pretty hefty decline in level III assets linked quarter about 15%. Is that largely driven by I&amp;L, and if so, can you give us a sense for how much of the reduction is due to actual runoff for planned portfolio sales versus just the impact of negative marks?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">A pretty meaningful driver was actually monetizations and harvesting that was really the driver.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So, actually underlying the negative mark-to-market on the public portfolio. It really does sound like there was very significant positive activity in terms of just being able to reduce positions?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes, I don\u2019t \u2013 in terms of reduced positions, you mean, in terms of harvesting\u2026</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes, monetization let\u2019s put it that way?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes, the portfolio did well. As I said, the vast majority of the driver of the performance in the portfolio came from event driven things like IPOs, asset sales. Obviously, the public portfolio suffered with public markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And in terms of \u2013 just a follow-up on exactly that comment, would it be as straightforward as to saying the public portfolio was $4 billion in equities, the MSCI as you\u2019ve alluded to was down about 10% that the mark there would be about that, or is it more complex to that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">It can be different from quarter-to-quarter, but I would say that\u2019s pretty reasonable.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. Thanks, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thanks so much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question is from the line of Fiona Swaffield with RBC. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Hey, Fiona.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Fiona Swaffield</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Just \u2013 hi. Just few things. One is the difference between the CT1 ratios and obviously the difference in Advanced and Standardized has gone down quite a lot. And it seems to be something to do, I just wondered, is it the operational risk RWA, I don\u2019t know if you could talk through the differences in those numbers?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And the second is just a geographic question. I mean, you\u2019ve alluded to Asia a few times, but could you kind of give us a feel for year-on-year geographic revenues, or kind of trends EMEA versus Asia, were those any big change versus on Q2? Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes. So in terms of the ratios in Advanced and there was a pick up in operational, which impacted and there was a pickup in operational, which impacted the operational, but the real driver in the improvement of the ratios was on harvesting, in general risk reduction and you\u2019re seeing it more in standardized, because obviously there are things that are not eccentric, which impact that more like things like clearing and other things and notional and so that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing the compression. In terms of geography, it has been pretty much 55% in the U.S. and then the balance is really two-thirds EMEA and one-third Asia.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Fiona Swaffield</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Like what time period would that be is that Q3?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">No that\u2019s this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Fiona Swaffield</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Great. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Hey. Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Hey, good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Just a question on the M&amp;A outlook. I think there\u2019s been some concern with the disruptions in the market in U.S. hitting the record level that the M&amp;A cycle might be peaking. I just wanted to get your thoughts on that. It seems like number of deals haven\u2019t really moved. International volume still remained very well. So I just maybe some thoughts on how you guys think about where we are in the M&amp;A cycle given some of the concerns out there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So, the two factors that, obviously we rely on most is the backlog, and the pipeline is good. And as I said it was up at the end of the third quarter and then really the most significant information component for us is the level of dialogue that board\u2019s CEOs are having and the dialogue feels quite good. I think it\u2019s always natural for folks to question when the market has been robust, whether there is information content in the actual activity level as peaking and maybe that\u2019s a factor.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">But when you look at past cycles they\u2019ve been more significantly driven by LBO activity where certainly you can get some market capacity and how much debt can be borrowed and it\u2019s a 100% accurate to note that certainly the cost of financing is a contributor to the transactions that are happening today, but they\u2019re much more strategic and a reflection of slower global growth and how confident CEOs are at this stage. And that could always get disrupted, you can have a market event, but I don\u2019t know necessarily that the aggregate activity levels to-date are the best indicators that they would slow down. If anything, some of these large transactions very naturally have spin-offs and foster other activity across industries. That wouldn\u2019t be the most significant factor we\u2019d look at.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So, you would kind of think is the large deals as this maybe potentially a leading indicator, because a lot of these smaller deals and the number of deals have been lagging.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">That\u2019s correct, but so if you get large deals in a sector, it can have a knock on effect and you get spin-offs that can be a leading activity for more activity, but I think in short our indicators tell us that if the current environment continues the level of activity will be high. Again that could always change, a lot of things in the world can shift.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Sure. Okay and maybe just a follow-up on the balance sheet. I think if I look at your disclosures you guys balance sheet was up to a level we haven\u2019t seen in a I think over a year I think balance sheet was up 20 billion plus quarter-over-quarter yet it was a volatile environment, it just looked like you pulled back on risk at least in the bar, can you kind of just help me think through that, you didn\u2019t close on the deposit franchise acquisition this quarter \u2013 third quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">No, that\u2019s subject to regulatory approval.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Great.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">No, the balance sheet growth, when you cut through it is really all driven by prime brokers\u2019 activity and so is all client driven in terms of client assets that came in during the course of the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Just sort of interesting, putting on leverage or?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">No actually, you get somebody to fix when people de-lever, actually you can get cash that comes in and actually comes into the balance sheet so client assets can grow partial driver.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. Thanks a lot.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">No problem.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question is from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christoph Kotowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes, hi your comp ratio on a full-year basis have been trending down ever so slightly last couple of years and you were able to keep the year-to-date comp ratio flat at 40% with revenues being down a percent. Going into the fourth quarter how should we think about the full-year comp ratio in terms of that there\u2019d be upward pressure on it if the full-year revenues miss a bit more from here or continued downward pressure the fourth quarter ends up being better and driving you above where you were last year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So, no change to the compensation philosophy the 40% at this point a year is our best estimate. And we\u2019ll have to see I can\u2019t predict the outcome for you in terms of where the Roland obviously we\u2019ve spent in number of years really building in pretty significant operating leverage, but we\u2019ll have to see how the year plays out, but we\u2019ll go through our normal bottoms up top down process.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christoph Kotowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay, all right. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Morning, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">The you made a point in the press release about the IB backlog building and just was kind of curious whether or not in your view that\u2019s a function improving business outlook or just deals getting held up due to market volatility in some of the trends that we saw impact the FB underwriting line?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yes, so all parts of the backlog were up. The biggest part of the backlog, that was up with equity underwriting. And part of that is the markets being more challenges, and challenge in part of the season, but I think that the more important takeaway is less about market influence over the quarter and more about activity levels client confidence, which certainly at times for CEOs would have been tested as we came during the quarter. But the transactions that they\u2019re contemplating are very long-term and strategic. And so I think it speaks more to corporate confidence than anything else.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay, but thanks for that color. And then thinking about that point and then connecting it to I&amp;L and the commentary around monetization events and such. Can you help us understand how, when, the exit strategy or ability to use the IPOs or equity markets is weaker how you guys were able to have an up-tick in monetization and episodic events in I&amp;L I was just trying to connect those two dots please.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So, again it\u2019s just it\u2019s the nature of the portfolio, it won\u2019t always necessarily be this way in the quarter, but there will be opportunities for us to sell assets and in taking company\u2019s public and those kind of things those were usually on a schedule, it usually don\u2019t happen instantaneously they can certainly get delayed by market activity. But I can\u2019t answer the question any better for you than it\u2019s the nature of the portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay and I mean did you rely on M&amp;A in addition to IPO, it sounds like you were purely relying going on the IPOs market right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">There\u2019s IPOs, private sale they can come in a number of different forms, so there\u2019s certainly transaction that you wouldn\u2019t see the public eye parts of the portfolio are in real estate not really heavy and financials or anything like that not heavy in energy. So that gives you some of the background why maybe the portfolio on it\u2019s surface would have performed better than you might have expected.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Great, thanks for the color Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Hi good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Good morning Steven.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Harvey, I appreciated all your comments on the quarter FICC strategy how are you still committed to business at the same time aren\u2019t going to be complacent. And just looking at some of the capital metrics, it feels as though the RWAs have been slight to maybe honest slightly downward trajectory, but we haven\u2019t seen any meaningful change in terms capital and risk allocations.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And just want to get a sense as to and trying and obviously making a concerted effort not to simply be complacent whether you\u2019re going to look to shrink risk on and any meaningful way within that business if the pressures persists on the revenue side?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So, the risk reduction again well level said it since we want obviously the risk reduction is pretty significant right RWAs were down a third across ICS, which is vastly, which is mostly FICC and so I think the risk reduction effort, the balance sheet reduction, the cost reduction exercises have been pretty significant.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So I don\u2019t think we can be accused of being complacent around the cycle again this is about finding that right balance. If the cycle continues and it stops we\u2019ll continue to evaluate the business that is an ongoing process that never stops. If the cycle picks up then, we will obviously participate and that we can feel good about the competitive environment and our client engagement. Now away from fixed, obviously, we\u2019re doing lots of other things. So, I talked about the fact that we made a number of acquisitions in asset management and that fee-based business continues to grow and be a bigger part of the firm. Obviously, full engagement in IBD and or the merger activity and their performance I think has been stellar.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So there\u2019s a lot going on under the hood in terms of reallocating resources. But we are being very disciplined about the fixed business during this part of the cycle, as you would expect us to be.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay, thanks for that, Harvey. And it\u2019s a fair point on the RWA, as I was talking more in the near-term context over the last few quarters. But certainly, since we\u2019ve been monitoring all the Basel III measures, you made a pretty substantial progress?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">That I also think, look, I think if you look at our capital management and the capital we\u2019ve been able to return over the last several years, we\u2019ve been as judicious as we can given the capital rules, and managing the firm in a way to make sure that the financial footings are perfectly solid.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. And then as you mentioned the capital rules, there is one quick follow-up. Did you say buffers have all been published by the Fed, it looks like you guys fell into the 3% bucket. I just wanted to get a sense as to whether you see any opportunities to optimize or shrink into that lower buffer 2.5 or given that CCARs are binding constraint, at least, for the moment as maybe not such a pressing need to do that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So, well, I think the big picture, the first thing we\u2019ll do obviously is in any opportunity that we think we can reduce our systemic footprint now that the rule is finalized. Obviously, we would look to do that. I think that\u2019s just good practice. I think the trade-off obviously is whether or not in making those reductions, does that really impact your ability to deliver to clients. Now the rules are finalized. There are certainly things we can do.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">As you said, we\u2019re not bound currently by our state of capital ratios, CCARs are are constrained, we\u2019ll have to see how CCAR evolves over time, that certainly could be an influence, because it could ultimately reprice the cost of that capital relative to the services we provide. But I think it\u2019s a bit early for that, at least, for us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">All right. Thanks for taking my questions, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question is from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Hi, how are you? Just to follow up on the I&amp;L discussion. Can you give us a sense of how we should think about sort of the quarter-to-quarter risk management practices within that unit, given how market volatility can have such a profound effect on revenue recognition in any given period?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Well, again, I think, one of the \u2013 I think one of the things to point out is, if you think about the transformation of the I&amp;L balance sheet over the last several years, it has changed pretty significantly. The composition today, as I said earlier is really 75% debt. And roughly two-thirds of that is HFI accounting, which is just good old-fashioned bank accounting. The balance is equities and if you compare that to, for example, go back to 2011, in 2011, I think the whole portfolio was more than 50% equities. And so the composition of the portfolio has changed significantly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Now, if you\u2019re going to have $4 billion public equity portfolio, which is the result of us monetizing asset out of the portfolio and we\u2019re in a sell-down process, if the markets move around a lot that\u2019s going to move around a lot. And ultimately, if the markets decline for extended periods of time or increase for extended periods, obviously that drives value of underlying assets and it drives activity for all businesses in all industries. But the portfolio composition has changed pretty dramatically over the last several years. And when you talk about the volatility, I can\u2019t help to remind you that over long periods of time, I&amp;L has been a pretty big driver of book value.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">No, certainly, I mean, I guess, my \u2013 I\u2019m trying to make sure I sort of fully understand, given that so much of the, at least, equity opportunity does come from seed investments sort of then hit their liquidation strategy, sort of how that shifts the risk management discussion when you move from no liquid to an \u2013 to a liquid asset, whose risk parameters are somewhat different?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yes. So we obviously consider that I think the most important risk component in the discussion is about the point of actually establishing the investments and that\u2019s a long-term process of being disciplined that has to be the philosophy, so look if we see a number of quarters of back to back declining in market that may be the right time to actually being to put capital to work which is why we run with excess capital and we run with excess liquidity because we want to be there for those opportunities and we want to be there for our client. So we size the risk of the investment at the point of making it. Once you have it you can certainly do things but prudent risk management really is the point of the initial decision.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Got it and that makes a lot of sense and if I can just sneak in one quick follow up on the RWA discussion within the trading businesses. Was there any real change in RWA over the course of the quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">There were I mean in advance, we finished the quarter at 570 that was down a little bit. In standardized we finished at 582 which you would expect to be down given the move I gave you in the ratios earlier.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And presumably most out of FICC or someone else?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Sorry, what was that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And I was just saying was that mostly because of changes in FICC composition or something else?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">The big mover was really in markets which in advanced went from 13.6% to kind of 11.9% and Standardized went from 13.7% down to 12.0% and that really is about derisking.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Great. Thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question is from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marlin Lacey Mosby IV</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thanks. Good morning Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Good morning Marty.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marlin Lacey Mosby IV</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I wanted to give you a chance to stop the drum beat that we have had on levelling out the comp ratio through the year when you mentioned earlier that some consistency of returns for the whole company and not the volatility of revenues. So, just wanted to see whether or not you think coincidentally, the way that this line is up as you go through the calendar year, revenues are typically stronger in the first half, and you get the comp ratio benefit in the second half and somehow coincidentally that kind of hedges each other. I just wanted to get your thoughts on that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So we don\u2019t do it that way as other way that we think about it. There\u2019s some seasonality to the business which historically has been the case for the entire industry. As it relates to the compensation ratio from quarter-to-quarter, we just make our best estimates of where we think the performance of the firm is and what the compensation ratio should be. In the fourth quarter we will go through our normal process which again will be firm performance rather than to the businesses and to the individuals and it would top down to bottoms up and we will just have to see where things turn out for the fourth quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marlin Lacey Mosby IV</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So that\u2019s why I was mentioning coincidentally. I know you don\u2019t tie them together like that but it kind of works out in the favour of, kind of stabilizing as you go through the year. The second thing I was going to ask you was you mentioned the acquisitions in the asset managers and what we used to do is look at certain businesses where you could really leverage your economic capital while not really impacting your regulatory capital and I thought this is probably a business that might fit into that category and just thought is that kind of how you look at it and also there are other businesses you might be able to take advantage of that in?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So we\u2019re always looking really at the quarter. We are always looking at ways where we can enhance the client experience and so you know all these acquisitions which I mentioned, they really break down to three large buckets, secular growth opportunities like advisory and in that it was referenced in the \u2013 as I said in the Pacific Global Advisors\u2019 acquisition, and those things like new product capabilities where we certainly develop new products internally, but there are times both in demand is better for us and that\u2019s an example, that would be Westpeak and ActiveBeta and then there are times when we just want to scale existing products like money markets and you have seen us do acquisitions in that space. It really is all about \u2013 thing about how we can differentiate with our clients. Now from a regulatory capital perspective, we don\u2019t necessarily think about that as much as we think about what is the best way to deploy our capital. Obviously we have to manage our regulatory capital but this is a result of regulatory requirements or anything like that. We will always look at acquisitions or ways to grow or deploy our capital that are long-term accretive for the firm. We want to just to grow obviously those that consume more regulatory capital and those that consume less.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marlin Lacey Mosby IV</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And those that will have a little less or little more efficient and use of the capital that you have, but thanks and I appreciate your comments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay. Thanks. So I just had a quick question on the deposits strategy. You mentioned that was all about the funding diversification. So if you look at the second quarter deposits were about 12% of total liabilities. What percentage that you need to get to for you to consider that to be you\u2019ve to meet your diversification levels as you want?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So it\u2019s not so much that we are targeting a specific level. We cannot \u2013 not to target specific levels around things like that, because it is much about the asset footing as it\u2019s about liabilities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">In our liability structure, we just like that having a diversified geographic client base, source of liabilities, we just think that\u2019s prudent risk management. When you think about it, it\u2019s all really about where various investors want to provide capital to the firm and so that\u2019s how we think about it. So we haven\u2019t set a target. The reason we don\u2019t set targets and things like that is we always are concerned about building up too much of a warehouse of liquidity, we obviously hold a very significant liquidity cushion at $193 billion. Like you don\u2019t want to feel yourself getting pressed into deploying those liabilities, you don\u2019t want the liabilities to drive your asset strategy, you want your liabilities to inform it and you want to have diversified safe funding.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Do you anticipate that there will be some benefit on interest expense over time as you might take off maybe short-term borrowings?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">It could be over time I don\u2019t think in terms of the online deposit I don\u2019t see a huge cost advantage there. Again it\u2019s all maybe about how can we deploy that funding into the asset opportunities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay great there was no other question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Your next question is from the line of Kian Abouhossein with JPMorgan Chase. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kian Abouhossein</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Yes, hi. First question relates to commodities, you mentioned, so you talked about the lending exposure, but frankly I\u2019m not really interested in that I\u2019m more interested how you manage your counterparty exposure.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And if you can talk a little bit about how you think about these trading entities that you deal with, how you are managing counterparty exposure considering rating downgrades that we have seen, but also concerns about some of these entities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And if you can just run us little bit through how you manage counterparty risk on your off balance sheet exposure?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yes. Hi Kian. I\u2019m sorry you must\u2019ve missed it what I was saying before was our exposure whether it\u2019s lending or through any derivatives or counterparty exposure to the trading entities is less than $200 million today.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kian Abouhossein</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">So that\u2019s your net exposure off balance sheet and on balance sheet?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yes correct that\u2019s for the trading out. Again they often intend to position us as more as competitors than clients.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kian Abouhossein</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">So that\u2019s our current credit exposure.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kian Abouhossein</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And just in that context clearly you must adjust to rating downgrades as well as your own view around some of the counterparties, the margins or collateral calls etcetera. Can you just explain a little bit to us how you do that? You said the adjustment happening beside the credit ratings, which will drive it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">We have a long history obviously managing counterparty exposure, which has been tested through pretty volatile markets and again the most important decision made at any point in time is when you establish that credit line it\u2019s really no different than lending, but obviously the dynamics are different.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And we have a very diligent marking policy and we monitor collateral calls very vigilantly as you would imagine. And obviously as sectors are weaker you\u2019re very thoughtful about it, but when we make these decisions over long-term we have lot of experience doing it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kian Abouhossein</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay and in respect just coming back to your fixed-income business the way I at least to myself explain the weakness and please correct me if I\u2019m incorrect is the fact that you are weak on macro and weaker in corporate so just probably correlate it and you\u2019re strong in credit and hedge fund business. And first of all is that an incorrect assumption relative to your peers, I mean, especially some of your money centered peers?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And secondly, if I\u2019m correct, what are you doing? Do you think about diversifying more as a business into and particular as a macro business? And what are you doing to adjust that mix?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">So, again, I don\u2019t have great visibility into the competitors. I would say, I do think there are two obvious things which I talked about before. We\u2019re not at big in emerging markets, again, we don\u2019t have a footprint in hundreds of offices and we\u2019re not a big lender to corporate. Our competitors are much greater lenders than we are. And so that certainly can influence your client base.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">In terms of macro, I think, you are wrong about that. And certainly, in commodities, we\u2019ve had a long history being commodities and it feels now like we\u2019re bigger in commodities as the number competitors have pulled away from the business. That \u2013 those are the effects I would give you in terms of what I can say.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">In terms of things we\u2019re trying to do, we feel pretty good about the diversified business. I mean, if you think about the course of the year to be sitting here basically nearly flat revenues with our fee-based business is picking up activity, which is compensating for our capital intensive parts of the firm, which you would expect to be more challenged in this kind of market environments. If you look at end of the day when you adjust for legacy costs, we\u2019re nearly a 12% ROE. I know the business grows pretty diversified.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kian Abouhossein</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">So you don\u2019t this argument valid off of the nimble credit geared to rather than macro in certain periods of the environment, depending on the environment we will just perform slightly differently from some of our peers, you don\u2019t see that against your money-centered peers?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I think a lot of the peers have different footings, some are more domestic, some are more emerging-market base, I think the comparables are harder. Again look, take a look at the first quarter. In the first quarter, the way you look at it, we would have outperformed all the peers, that\u2019s information for us. But we\u2019re not going to steer the business in a different direction, because of that we\u2019re not going to over steer it [Technical Difficulty] their revenues on the surface would greater than ours. We\u2019re always going to look ways to improve the business. So that you should just incorporate by reference.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kian Abouhossein</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay, very helpful. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Thanks, Kian.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">At this time there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Since there are no more questions, I\u2019d like to take a moment to thank all of you for joining this call. Hopefully, I and other members of the senior management will see many of you in the coming months. If any additional questions arise, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to Dane, otherwise enjoy the rest of your day, and look forward to speaking with you on our fourth quarter earnings call in January.
