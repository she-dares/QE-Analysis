[Operator Instructions] It's now my pleasure to turn the program over to Kevin Stitt. Please begin, sir.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Kevin Stitt</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning. Before Brian Moynihan and Chuck Noski begin their comments, let me remind you that this presentation does contain some forward-looking statements regarding both our financial condition and financial results, and that these statements involve certain risks that may cause actual results in the future to be different from our current expectations.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">These factors include, among other things, changes in economic conditions, changes in interest rates, competitive pressures within the financial services industry and legislative or regulatory requirements that may affect our businesses. For additional factors, please see our press release and SEC documents.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Also joining us this morning will be Neil Cotty, our Chief Accounting Officer. And with that, let me turn it over to Brian.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thanks to all of you and good morning. We know this has been a busy week for all of you and thank you for joining us on a Friday. Before Chuck takes you through the quarter, I was going to give you some perspectives and provide some thoughts about the economy and the priorities we have for 2011. I'll stay mostly with the key-takeaway slide on Slide 4 and touch on a couple of other slides, and then turn it over to Chuck to begin on Slide 9.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">As we think about 2010, we came in to the year with a focus on continuing to clean up the issues left over from the crisis, while continue to driving the franchise forward. Finishing integration work in Merrill Lynch and Countrywide and continue to simplify our business model. During the year, we made progress in many of these items. In the area of credit, our improvement has been strong. Charge-offs have now improved for seven consecutive quarters and yet there's still room to improve here. We continue to see improvements in delinquencies at this quarter and of the last few quarters. The underwriting changes we made in 2008 across all the products with Credit Card, Home Equity and First Mortgage are performing better than we would've expected when we made those changes in those years. This ought to hold us in good stead as we move towards 2011 in terms of credit.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">On the credit side, we released reserves of $7 billion during 2010, and while we know this is not core earnings, it helped offset some of the cost of representation and warranties about $7 billion, no litigation costs and other matters during the year. But even without release, our reserve coverage ratio of 1.6x annualized charge-offs is the highest this company's had in many, many years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We also identified the non-core loan portfolios and began to work those off out of the company. As we showed you, that's about $130 billion at the start of the year, now it's down around $100 billion. Now the good news on the loan side as the franchise is driven forward, we are starting to see stability in the core loan balances that we want to carry-forward for this company. We've even seen some modest growth with some of the areas. Our utilization rates, for example, and our commercial rate was stable in the fourth quarter from quarter three and that bodes well for 2011.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">As we think about capital, we ended the year with questions around it especially given the fact that the new Basel Rules are starting to emerge along with the other changes in adopting Basel II and the fed market risk rules, et cetera. We told you at the beginning of the year we need to hit targets of 5.5% to 6% tangible common equity ratios and 8.5% to 9% tier 1 common ratios under Basel I by year end in order to have the capital to run this company. This represents the view that we have that the risk capital we need to run the company. We achieved both of those goals this year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We've also started early to make good progress to mitigating the changes that are going to come about in both capital and risk-weighted asset measures that will come with the new Basel Rules. This gives us strong confidence that we have a clear path meeting all these rules as are adapted in staying above regulatory minimums during the next couple of years as they come through. And even during that period, we have the ability to pay dividends and do stock buybacks over time as approved by our regulators.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">During the year, we also focused on our franchise. And what we mean by focused, we sold non-core positions and businesses, 20-some units overall, netting $19 billion proceeds, at the same time fulfilling the commitments to our TARP repayments and streamlining the franchise and focusing on the three core customer goods and the core products for them. In addition to that work, we redesigned the consumer account strategy to deal with the new regulations that came in 2009 and 2010. As you read in the press, we patterned our new account structure to mitigate the revenue loss from these regulations and still provide strong customer choice. By providing that choice and the changes we've made, we've seen dramatically lower attrition and complaints and account closures on our consumer businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">From the shareholders side, our stock did underperform, and our returns on equity returns and returns on assets are not where we want them and continue to be affected by one-time events. But during the year, we did successfully grow our tangible book value per share by 15% and we look forward to driving that forward in the future.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">By far, the biggest legacy issue we continue to deal is on the mortgage side. On Pages 7 and 8, we highlight some of the changes that Chuck will talk about, some the rep and warranty put-back issues later. But let me summarize on the key elements. As we entered the year 2010, a lot of the operational work is around the modification area and building up the teams due to foreclosures. As we move through the year, discussions around representations and warranties started dominating the discussions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">This year we took a total of $7 billion of representation and warranty cost that offsets the revenue and significant portion of our mitigation expenses here was also due to mortgage issues. We are pleased to put the GSEs behind us this quarter as we announced on January 3. We'll continue to focus our efforts in protecting our shareholders regarding these matters as we deal with the other counterparties involved in representation and warranty and put-back issues. When we think about modifications, our efforts continue to build. We did 285,000 modifications during 2010, including 76,000 during the fourth quarter alone, the most in the industry. We completed our review of the foreclosure practices. The process is working. And we've restarted the efforts cautiously. We'll continue to face regulatory and other scrutiny here but the work is proceeding and we are very focused on doing this right for all the parties involved.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">During 2010, we also completed a milestone of $2 billion of merger integration work. The next quarter will actually complete the final touches on the Merrill Lynch integration. And for the first time in many years, we'll have no integration work to do in this company. What that gives us the ability to do is turn that energy and focus to managing our efficiency in the company towards simplification, including that, we'll be taking our four deposit systems during 2011, 2012 to one deposit system and many other like activities. Our expense levels are not where we want them right now. They are higher because of debt collection and other costs related to legacy issues. But if you think about what we've been doing in managing expenses, we continue to invest in the franchise while managing through the post-crisis issues.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">To help you think about that, think of the headcount in the company. During the year, our headcount has up by about 3,000 people. We dedicate almost 13,000 additional people to the mortgage issues and foreclosure modifications and collection areas. We've invested 2,000 people in growth areas, about half in the wealth management in other areas in the United States and about half outside the United States. That means the rest of the franchise is effectively down about 10,000 to 12,000 people. So we continue to manage cost while we deal with the legacy issues and invest for growth and that's how we'll continue to run the franchise during 2011.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">While the work was going on and sort of repositioned the balance sheet capital in the franchise, the core business has continued to progress. First, our job is to drive the integration as franchise to bring the combination which can do better than anyone of our business as a standalone business could do. If you look at the Appendix, Slides 33 and 34, you can see some of the evidence there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Our Card business turned to an operating profit this year from a $5 billion loss last year. Our deposits performance was challenged by the lowest straight environment and the regularly changes as improving customer scores and our share deposits continue to grow on the retail side even giving effect to our disciplined pricing strategies. Our deposits now cost $1 trillion of Bank of America for the first time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Our Wealth Management business has seen strong growth, both in assets under management flows, assets under management deposits and we see long stabilized net business. We've made good progress in hiring financial advisors, wealth management bankers and other client base and teammates. The group has produced a solid profit, including record revenue, in the fourth quarter of 2010 and still has lots of great opportunity ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Our Global Commercial Banking business, our minimum market and small business banking business recovered strong earnings and returns this year as credit normalized and our market-leading position showed their strength.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In our global banking and markets area which with large corporate investment banking and the trading and capital market activity, we maintain our number 2 position on Investment Banking business throughout the year. Our investment banking fees from third parties were the highest this quarter they've been since we merged with Merrill. Our sales and trading revenue team had a solid year but we have varied results by quarter, going from a high of $7 billion in revenue to a low of around $3 billion. We're satisfied with the year in total but we need to work at the ups and downs and Chuck will take you through some of the details on that later on.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">But as we think about 2010, we made progress. We stayed with the lines of balance sheet and capital and you can see that on Slide 6 and some statistics on the balance sheet statistics given there. We did loss $2 billion for the year 2010 and $1 billion in the fourth quarter, both of those numbers we are disappointed with, but with the year came large ins and outs and they're all new and driven by legacy issues which we continue to put behind us, $12 billion in after-tax goodwill impairment, $7 billion in representation and warranty and put-back costs as a counter to revenue, $3 billion in litigation expense, nearly $2 billion in emerging restructuring charges and other charges like that and those of course were offset in part by the $7 billion in reserve releases and $3 billion in asset sales.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We clearly need to continue to reduce the ins and outs and what the core franchise performance comes through for you, our investors. As we look to 2011, the priorities are clear. We are going to make progress of putting the mortgage operational issues behind us, meaning modifications, foreclosures and related process improvements. On the representation and warranty and put back area, we're going to continue to make progress only if we can do it on a basis consistent with our shareholder interest. But our best guess is this will take a longer period of time, perhaps a few years. We're going to drive the core customer businesses, integrating this powerful franchise we leave to each customer. We are going to drive our expense management during the year, ensuring that we get the expenses out of here as we continue to recover in the mortgage and other credit-related costs. And importantly, we're going to deliver on the growth opportunities on our franchise, be it wealth management, the asset customer base and the consumer area, the investment banking and in the area, all 29 states and abroad and we'll continue to invest in those businesses as we did in 2010.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As we look to 2011, we see the economy continuing to recover. All the key metrics we see in our customer base that we monitor externally like you do, including the credit demand, consumer spending especially spending among middle-class and affluent clients, the debt burdens at households are caring, the asset quality portfolios, all of those are pushing ahead. We still face, however, the realities of high sticky unemployment in this country and a slow and stagnant recovering in housing and modest overall U.S. growth.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In this context, we'll continue to drive towards delivering shareholder returns by continuing to grow our tangible book value per share as we materialize in recovering the franchise. We continue to believe we're in a position to modest-increase our common dividend in the back half of 2011, but of course we need our regulators' approval to do so. So we still have a lot to do.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">But at the same time we have the best franchising industry, with number 1 and 2 positions in every product area, largest customer client base in the industry. We can't and will not lose our focus on levering this franchise as the economy improves for you, our shareholders. We have a clear strategy, to serve three customer groups with our core financial needs in the best way that any provider can do. We have a well-defined operating principle which we've laid out for you that enables to meet that strategy and we continue to execute against them. 2010 was the year we repaired the balance sheet. We built some of the capital ratios and reserve ratios and also tough but necessary decisions as we focused on cleaning up our legacy issues. But as the economy continues to improve and we continue to execute, I have every confidence the franchise will keep moving to the performance it's capable of. Finally, I want to thank our 290,000 associates. The tireless efforts they made during 2010.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">And I'll turn it over to Chuck starting on Slide 9.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Charles Noski</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. As you can see on Slide 9, we reported a net loss of $0.16 per share for the quarter. Our results reflected the non-cash and non-tax deductible write-down of $2 billion or $0.20 per share of goodwill associated with our Home Loans and Insurance business that we discussed on January 3. Excluding this goodwill impairment charge, earnings were approximately $750 million or $0.04 per share after preferred dividends. Results for the fourth quarter reflected the positive and negative impact of several items which makes for a difficult comparison this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">If you turn to Slide 10, we've listed some of the larger items. Representations and warranties expense from the fourth quarter was $4.1 billion, of which $3 billion was associated with the GSE settlements we have previously described. The credit mark on structured liabilities under the fair value option resulted in a negative adjustment of $1.2 billion, reflecting the tightening of our credit spreads compared to a negative adjustment of $190 million in the third quarter and as reported in other income.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Asset sales during the quarter included our partial ownership in Blackrock, reducing our ownership from 34% to 7%, the sale of our rights to participate in CCB secondary offering and the sale of the majority of the Global Securities Solutions business. We had $872 million in security gains during the quarter. We already touched on the goodwill impairment charge. Excluding fees paid to external legal service providers, litigation expense for the quarter was $1.5 billion, primarily related to our consumer businesses including the Mortgage business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Merger-related and restructuring charges were $370 million, loan loss reserves were reduced by $1.7 billion in the quarter versus $1.8 billion in the third quarter. And finally, we had a tax benefit of $2.4 billion, primarily reflecting the pre-tax loss before the goodwill impairment charges, the release of a capital loss carryover valuation allowance of about $1.2 billion, and normal tax preference items.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Turning to Slide 11, you can see that four of our business segments made money in the fourth quarter. Deposits lost money due to increased litigation costs this quarter and was also affected by the full impact of REG E and continued low interest rates. Global Card Services benefited from improving credit quality and reported $1.5 billion in net income. Global Wealth and Investment Management had a very good quarter, earning $332 million, due primarily to a near-record quarterly revenue levels driven by market activity, strong long-term client flows and a shift to the mix of assets towards higher margin products. Home Loans and Insurance were significantly impacted by legacy costs, including the goodwill impairment charge, reps and warranties expense and litigation costs. Our first Mortgage Banking business however, excluding these costs, was profitable in the quarter. Global Commercial Banking earned more than $1 billion this quarter as credit quality continued to improve and has delivered stable revenue through the cycle, reflecting strong client retention. Global Banking and Market showed continued solid results in investment and corporate banking, offset by a difficult trading environment in global markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Let's turn to net interest income on Slide 12. Net interest income on an FTE basis was $12.7 billion, essentially flat with the third quarter. The impact of low rates and lower consumer balances, excluding residential mortgages, were offset by positive hedge income of $250 million, increased balances in the discretionary portfolio and a reduction in long-term debt. Our average earning assets for the quarter were up $20 billion, mainly due to growth in consumer loans and securities. Cash declined due to a shift in liquidity mix from cash to liquid securities in addition to a net reduction in our outstanding debt. Consumer loans increased due to retained mortgage originations. Commercial loan demand stabilized in the quarter. And as we said earlier, average commercial loans, excluding real estate, were up 1% from the prior quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Although we were flat with the third quarter, we expect net interest income to decline over the next couple of quarters. In the first quarter of 2011 in particular, we expect net interest income to drop from fourth quarter levels due to fewer days in the quarter, continued declines from our loan run-off portfolios and an anticipated reduction in hedge results. We expect to see stabilization in net interest income sometime in the second half of the year. We're also on track to lower our long-term debt footprint by 15% to 20% by the end of 2011 relative to third quarter 2010 levels.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Slide 13 shows you that both average loans and deposits were up for the quarter. Deposits remains a good story of growth as wealth management clients continue to do more business with us and commercial customers continue to prefer to hold rather than invest cash.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On Slide 14, you can see that period end loans from the end of September were up approximately $6.5 billion due to growth of almost $17 billion partially offset by net charge-offs and decreases in our run-off portfolios. We have a slide in the Appendix that details our run-off portfolios for you. The $17 billion increase in total loans was driven by residential mortgages, primarily FHA-insured originations as we use some excess liquidity and C&amp;I loans offset by a slight decrease in commercial real estate.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Turning to Slide 15. Card revenue was up 7% from third quarter results due to 12% increase in interchange income. Increases in retail spending were 4% versus the prior quarter and 5% versus the prior year. These increases helped drive the increase in interchange income. And on the managed basis, Card revenue was relatively flat from a year ago despite the impact of the CARD Act.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On Slide 16, we show service charges were down $176 million from third quarter levels to $2 billion which is the number we targeted for you two quarters ago. The decrease was due to the approximately $275 million impact of Reg E this quarter after becoming effective midway through the third quarter. So now that the full impact of Reg E is embedded in our results, you can use this quarter's results as a base going forward. Remember though that the full impact from both Reg E and the CARD Act wasn't reflected in the quarterly results and service charges in Card revenue for the first three quarters of 2010.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Other regulatory impacts that will affect service charges in 2011 are the Durbin amendment which is scheduled to occur in the last half of the year. We expect this would cost us approximately $1 billion in revenue. We won't know the expected impact on debit card at interchange though until late April, so we hope to update you on that during our first quarter earnings call.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">While expect to mitigate some of the impact over time, we do expect the impact of mitigation efforts will be modest in 2011.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Mortgage Banking revenue on Slide 17 decreased from the third quarter, as a result of higher reps and warranties expense which includes the impact of the GSE agreements and additional accrued liabilities. MSR performance net of hedges was $257 million this quarter, an increase of $347 million compared to the loss last quarter. Although production volume in First Mortgage at $85 billion was up from the third quarter, production revenue was down due to lower lock volumes and production margins. The capitalization rate for the consumer mortgage MSR asset ended the quarter at 92 basis points versus 73 basis points in the third quarter. Given the direction of interest rates since Thanksgiving and the redeployment of some of our salesforce to assist with our distressed customers, we forecast production levels will be lower over the near term.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Turning to Slide 18. You can see the total reps and warranties expense in the quarter was $4.1 billion, up $3.3 billion from the prior quarter. Much of the increase was the result of our recent agreements with the GSEs. The liability we have accrued on the balance sheet increased approximately $1 billion to $5.4 billion as the $4.1 billion representations of warranties expense was partially offset by approximately $3 billion in charge-offs and other activities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">As you can see, our unresolved repurchase requests totaled approximately $10.7 billion at year end. This amount includes $1.7 billion of demands contained in the communication from private label securitization investors. We believe these investors do not have the contractual right to demand the repurchase of loans directly or the right to access loan files. The inclusion of these claims and the amounts reflected in the chart does not mean that we believe these claims have satisfied the contractual requirements that would permit them to direct the securitization trustee to take action or that they are otherwise procedurally or substantively valid.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Outstanding claims were reduced by $2.3 billion driven by the resolution of $8 billion of claims during the quarter, including $4.9 billion as part of the GSE agreements. Monoline claims outstanding continue to grow as the monolines continue to submit claims and are generally unwilling to withdraw these claims even when they have given evidence refuting the claims. The increase in rescissions in approvals in the fourth quarter were substantially impacted by the agreements with the GSEs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We've included slides in the Appendix that update the information we presented earlier this year on our GSE experience.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On Slide 19, we provided additional information around our experience with non-GSE counterparties which would encompass whole loan sales and private label securitizations, including those where monolines have insured some or all of the debt.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">On Slide 37 on the Appendix we break down our non-GSE experience, much as we did for the GSEs. As you could see on Slide 19, from 2004 to 2008, $963 billion of loans were sold into private label securitizations or through whole loan sales where we believe we have originated reps and warranties exposure. We broke out the originations for you by both legacy entity, as well as product to give you a bit more clarity on the portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Through December 31, repurchased claims received on the 2004 to 2008 vintages totaled $13.7 billion. $6 billion on those claims have been resolved and as you can see, resolution success and rescission rates are much higher with private investors versus the monolines. The losses under result claims were approximately $1.7 billion. Of the remaining outstanding claims, $5.8 billion have been reviewed and declined for repurchase.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Moving to Slide 20. Of the $963 billion of original principal balance, 22% have defaulted or are severely delinquent. 58% of defaulted or severely delinquent loans made at least 24 payments prior to default or delinquency. As we have indicated previously, in those instances where we have had meaningful and consistent repurchase experience with counterparties such as the GSEs in certain monoline insurers, a liability for reps and warranties has been established for asserted and unasserted requests to repurchase current and future defaulted loans. With the exception of certain monoline insurers, we have not had meaningful and consistent repurchase experience with other non-GSE counterparties. We do evaluate all of the certain claims received from all parties in establishing our liability.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">However, as we and others in our industry have noted, analysts and other market participants have developed their own estimates of possible exposure for Bank of America and other institutions. Although the non-GSE claims experience remains limited, we expect additional activity in this area going forward and it is possible that further losses may occur. We received a number of investor inquiries following our GSE announcement earlier this month regarding the extent of such possible non-GSE exposure. In addition, in connection with our planning process, we evaluated various possible alternative scenarios. We've developed a preliminary estimate of a possible loss range using a variety of judgmental assumptions. That estimate suggests a possible upper range of loss that could be up to $7 billion to $10 billion over existing accruals.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">As a reminder, there are significant legal and procedural hurdles that counterparties would need to overcome before we believe any of these amounts could become probable. We would expect resolution of these matters to be a protracted process which could take years to conclude.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">As you could see on Slide 21, for example, there are substantial differences between the reps and warranties provided to GSEs and those provided in private label transactions. Until we have meaningful repurchase liability with these counterparties, we do not believe it is possible to determine that the loss is probable and accordingly to accrue for any such loss. As we have previously described to you, where we conclude that a valid breach of reps and warranties has occurred, we will act in a responsible manner. On the other hand, where we've concluded that the valid basis for repurchase does not exist, we will vigorously contest such claims and defend the interest of Bank of America and its shareholders.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay, now back to earnings on Slide 22. As I said earlier, our activity with wealth management clients resulted in revenue approaching record quarterly levels which is where we generate the bulk of the investment in brokerage revenues. Investment in brokerage revenue was up $155 million or 6% from the third quarter due to both higher asset management fees and brokerage income. Asset management fees were a record $1.4 billion and brokerage revenue was approximately $1.5 billion. Total client balances grew $69 billion to more than $2.2 trillion during the quarter as a result of market activity and strong flows in the deposits and long-term asset management products.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Sales and trading revenue on Slide 23 of $2.6 billion, which includes both net interest and noninterest income, decreased approximately 43% from the third quarter although higher than last year by 17%. The decrease in sales and trading was partially from seasonal declines but a few other factors standout. We had a softer trading environment as rates backed up, negatively impacting some of our risk positions. This also caused clients to exit bond funds with money flowing in the cash or equity funds putting pressure on prices. We've experienced this significant tightening of credit spreads during the year and to a lesser extent, during the fourth quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Certain sectors such as European debt experienced spread widening. We've also been focused on the impact of the new Basel capital rule and the impact to the amount of capital retracted to our markets business. Over the last couple of quarters, we've been focused on reducing the higher capital intensive assets and as well our exposure to shorter-term funding agreements.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">FICC was impacted the most from these items, decreasing 49%to $1.8 billion with lower results in credit, rates and commodities products. Equity revenue was down 19% to $789 million from the third quarter as an increase in cash business commission revenue from inflows was more than offset by a decline in market volatility and client flows impacting equity derivatives. We didn't have any major impact from legacy assets in the quarter while we continue to reduce our exposure to auction rate securities, CMBS and monolines.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">In investment banking on Slide 24, our overall fee ranking remain solid as we were ranked at a strong number two globally and number one in the U.S. Investment banking revenue increased 16% from the third quarter and was on par with the great fourth quarter from a year ago. Results were driven by increases in all areas namely M&amp;A, debt and equity capital markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Let me say a couple of things about expense levels on Slide 25. Total expense, excluding the goodwill impairment charges in the last two quarters, increased $2 billion from the third quarter. Expenses this quarter included higher litigation expenses as I said earlier. Personnel expense compared to the third quarter is up approximately $400 million, reflecting the build out of strategic hires in certain businesses including international, as well as certain severance and benefit-related expenses. Higher levels of headcount and expense in home loans and insurance were related to default management staff and the other loss mitigation activities in that business. Reiterating what Brian said earlier, our expense levels, excluding goodwill charges, are up from 2009 levels for several reasons, including additional headcount to address legacy mortgage issues. For 2011, we expect our expense levels to remain elevated as we work through these issues and continue to invest in the franchise.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Moving to asset quality trends on Slide 26. As they did throughout most of the year, delinquencies, excluding FHA loans, net charge-offs and nonperforming assets, continued to improve.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">On Slide 27, improving credit performance in almost all portfolios drove the decrease in net charge-offs. Net charge-offs of $6.8 billion decreased $414 million compared to the third quarter. Consumer net charge-offs were down $252 million, even with a $330 million valuation adjustment on certain mortgage loans, reflecting improvement in card and home equity. Commercial asset quality also improved as net charge-offs dropped 15% from the prior quarter with the biggest drivers being small business and commercial real estate. Reserve reductions included $1.1 billion on U.S. card, along with releases in commercial real estate, small business, direct and indirect consumer and commercial. On our $36 billion purchased credit impaired consumer book, which is comprised of discontinued real estate residential mortgages and home equity, we increased the reserve $828 million to reflect an adjusted outlook for home prices.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Even with the decline in reserve levels, the ratio of allowance for loan losses to annualized net charge-offs was essentially flat compared to the third quarter at roughly 1.6x and is up from roughly 1.1x a year ago. And thinking about our credit costs in 2011, we think provision expense should continue to edge down through the year as charge-offs continue to move lower primarily in the consumer businesses. We expect loan loss reserve reductions will continue as long as portfolio performance and the economy continue to improve and our other credit metrics weren't lower reserves.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">That concludes my prepared remarks for this morning. As you may know, we've scheduled March 8 to have our Investor Day in New York, so I look forward to seeing all of you there. And with that, let's open it up for questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p9\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from the side of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I wanted to talk a little bit about the risk gone, the mortgage and the cleanup that you mentioned and Brian at the beginning of the call. You've indicated that you could range private label $7 billion to $10 billion based on your assumptions. Why not take a large reserve against that and kind of be done with it in the next quarter or two?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Charles Noski</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Betsy, I want to be very clear for you and everyone on the line as to what the range is that we gave today. This is a possible range, not a probable range. It could be as low as zero theoretically, up to a high end of the range that we think could be $7 billion to $10 billion based upon an array of different assumptions and judgments, none of which we've seen in evidence through current behavior either in the portfolios or by the counterparties. So we really, as I said, we really don't have a basis to make an accrual. We had a lot of interest from investors asking us to help understand what we thought about a possible exposure in the future. And until we can meet the accounting criteria to judge this is probable, we really don't have a basis to make an accrual. And certainly, we expect there will be additional provisions in future quarters. We don't think they're going to fall to zero. But we really don't have a basis. This is an array of alternative scenarios we did during our year-end planning process coming into the new year to try to size under various kinds of scenarios what might happen. But it doesn't even begin to rise to the level of probability that would allow us to do in the accounting nor do we frankly expect that we would lose that amount.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">You do have some private label experience though, right, that you've paid out on. What's the reason for why that experience you've had so far isn't sufficient?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Charles Noski</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Actually, Betsy, most of that other repurchase experience was with whole loan investors and that's rather episodic as it relates to private label investors and securitizations, that has been extremely modest.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And the litigation reserves, the litigation cost that you had in the quarter, should we take that as a run rate for the foreseeable future or is there any color you can give us as to expected volatility in that line?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Charles Noski</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I think you should probably expect that we'll have some provisions there. They were both -- as I mentioned, the provision in the quarter was in our consumer businesses so it was more than just mortgage. And so there will be -- you saw in the Deposits business for the quarter that we reported a loss. Without the litigation provision associated with deposits that business would have been profitable in the quarter. But I think it's hard to think about a run rate for litigation expenses. Again, those will be based on the facts and circumstances and the judgments of our attorneys each quarter about the status of our overall litigation portfolio. Although, certainly a disproportionate part of our litigation portfolio is in the former Countrywide space.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And then last on FICC, in broad strokes, could you give us a sense as to how much of the FICC decline was due to either actively managing down due to Basel III, passively allowing things to roll off because of Basel III in DBA or just the market being difficult?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Charles Noski</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I would say, it would be largely the market being difficult and the lack of client flows. But certainly, as we look to manage our balance sheet more effectively, and think about the new capital rules, that has also had an impact.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Is there any DBA in there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Charles Noski</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">No, I think that's in other income.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And you outlined how much that is?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Charles Noski</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Maybe a small amount. But the big adjustment is the fair value option adjustment on the Merrill Lynch structured notes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We'll go next to the site of Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets &amp; Co.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Did you guys give -- have been giving out guidance on core pre-tax, pre-provision numbers? Because that's one of the numbers that we really like to look at. And I think numbers have tend to be all over the street. Can you help us out a little bit on how should we be looking at those numbers?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We have not given guidance on PP&amp;R and there are a couple of reasons. But the main one is that with a credit card business you can lead yourself to, and we talked about this in a few earnings calls ago, you can leave yourselves to a number when we had $30 billion, $40 billion of credit card charge-offs that the PP&amp;R is fine but you're always going to have the charge-off rate of some magnitude in there. And that then could lead in conclusion that it will go into zero and it won't because the cost to goods sold in credit card is part of credit card costs. So I think Chuck gave you various -- as he went through his presentation, various points of view about net interest income and it would sort of continue down as the interest rate environment and we had a good hedge quarter on that and that helped this quarter as it flattens and comes down and will flatten in the middle of next year and come back up. Expenses I think we gave as guidance for this. In terms of PP&amp;R, we struggle a little bit. I know that, that's a number that you track closely but we struggle a little bit of how you guide people on it overall but also important how it really plays into the context of the company that has a large credit card portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets &amp; Co.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Just one really quick follow up on Betsy's question is how much exposure do you have to the whole loan sales in the private label? In other words, you haven't disclosed how much you've sold out there? I think you disclosed last quarter what you've paid out on private label. I didn't see that disclosure this time around. I might have missed it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Charles Noski</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Let's see, I think if you went looking in the Appendix, probably your best sense of the non-GSE portfolio would be back on Page 38, Paul. But I don't think we've cut back at all on the disclosure we've given you with respect to the performance of these individual portfolios and the actions with counterparties.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets &amp; Co.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">But I was wondering, do you actually disclose how much you sold in whole loans to private label? Because I know we get some inside mortgage finance, we can get the overall private label exposure. But what's the exposure in the whole loan side? Because that's what you've been paying at, at this point. Am I correct?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We'll get to that. It's disclosed but we can get you that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Charles Noski</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We'll get you that, Paul. I don't think that's here in our slides today.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We'll go next to the site of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John McDonald - Bernstein Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Another clarification on the private label. Chuck, in the illustrative scenario of the $7 billion to $10 billion, when you say over existing accruals, I just want to clarify, which existing accruals are you referring to, is that litigation reserves or the rep and warranty reserve?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Charles Noski</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">It's both the rep and warranty reserves and the associated litigation reserves.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John McDonald - Bernstein Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So there's some contemplation of private label losses in both of those?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Charles Noski</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">We really, frankly, it's the entire portfolio. So if you look back on Slide 38, which shows the original principal balance I talked about earlier of $963 billion, how much remains unpaid and what we do is potentially at-risk. Our estimate contemplates that entire population because we believe we pretty well have taken care of GSEs already. But primarily it's monolines, it's private label, it's whole loan sales, it's all of that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John McDonald - Bernstein Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And where do the litigation reserves stand at year end?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Charles Noski</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">John, we don't disclose the amount of our litigation reserves -- the balances. We'll talk to you about provisions but we're not going to share that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John McDonald - Bernstein Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">In terms of the SCAP-tested, do you know if it's upper range illustration that you gave today what the federal accept as the adverse scenario outcome for the component of the SCAP?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Charles Noski</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">John, certainly, it's one of the 19 banks that participated in the process, we provided a whole array of information to our regulator. But I think that's viewed as supervisory information. I don't think we could really comment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John McDonald - Bernstein Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Could you give anymore color on what kind of magnitude of a drop in NII we might look for in the first half of 2011 or how much the hedge results helped in the fourth quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Charles Noski</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I think I mentioned that hedge results to the fourth quarter was a benefit of about $250 million. We'd love to continue that but anticipating that we don't have that level of help in the first quarter 2011 is probably a good guess.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John McDonald - Bernstein Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">That all of that goes way?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Charles Noski</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I think certainly a substantial part of it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John McDonald - Bernstein Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And then also just on the expense that you talked about. What adjustments should we make to the fourth quarter expense level to get to a sense of what the run rate is going into '11? Could you help us with that just kind of think about the expense run rate.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I think, John, in respect to Chuck give his perspective, I think there is a big lag expense run rate and if you look at Page 25 you can sort of see you've got two broad concepts. One is some of the one-time expenses, the extra litigation, higher level litigation in the quarter and things like that, year-in cleanup, professional fee and things that typically happen in the fourth quarter. So that's sort of one thing that you can neutralize. You can look over the quarters and smooth some of that our and think about that as a run rate question. But the second is the attention of personnel to work on the bad credit in a mortgage and that's why I tried to shape really a little bit. So during 2010 we added 13,000 people dedicated. We otherwise would need but they're working to help, dedicated to the task of helping on the mortgage cleanup. That's going to be elevated all through '11. It will take us '11 but probably half way through '12 before we sort of really get on downward side of being able to get through all that work and so those costs will stay in. So I think Chuck said overall, we don't think expenses are going to stay at these levels. And as they go up on comp or something like that, that's going to be revenue-related which should be good news. But the core expense run rate is sort of there and then as we work through this year and we'll be able to start to take it out as the mortgage activity, in particular in other activities like that start to subside.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Charles Noski</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">John, remember there's a spike in the first quarter from FAS 123 which is when we pay the equity compensation and some of that has to get recognized upfront because of some of these.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John McDonald - Bernstein Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Just back on the private label, can you give an update on the status of discussions with the group that sent out letter in October, the PIMCO Blackrock group. Is there a late January deadline for resolving that? And will we know when that's over?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">There's no real news on the discussions and there was an extension that was filed at the end of January, and we continue to talk to people but we haven't changed our posture. we're not doing anything. It's not going to be in our shareholders' best interest but we always want to talk to everybody in the world to make sure we understand where they stand.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">We'll go next to the site of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">If I could circle back on the FICC revenues. And I guess just bigger picture as we think about implementing all the changes for Basel III, what do you think the longer-term impact is versus a more normal run rate? And maybe I'll just throw a lot there, maybe annual level of FICC revenues were in the $10 billion, $12 billion range, Basel III would reduce that by 10%, 20%, or you think you can offset over time. Just any thoughts on what the near and longer-term impact could be.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I would say that we have been taking out what we would -- think about three in both and other things. We've been downsizing our -- we took our prop business down and it's actually almost done and we've done earlier this year. But overall, the rest of the impact is relatively modest. And I would not put the fourth quarter into Basel III and those types of things. I think it just was a tougher quarter in terms of client activity and tougher quarter in terms of market. And it's not any one area, we looked -- across the board we just had lower revenues and a lot of part of December nothing happened. So I wouldn't be focused on that. I think we're still comfortable with the average type of run rates we talked about, $4.5 billion, $5 billion in total revenue in sales trading platform that you can see if you look back. And we continue to size the business appropriately that way. Tom has made the changes there. So I wouldn't say that Basel III is going to affect us. We're going to run it tightly. We're going it run the balance sheet tightly, it's more because the economics involved than anything else. In this quarter. I'd really struck it up to in sort of a malaise and a tougher market quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">The $4.5 billion to $5 billion of sales and trading, that's quarterly level including both equity as in fixed income?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes, that's total revenue and capital market activities. it's going to bounce around. I mean, just look at the last four quarters, you can see a wide range. I think that's a little more pronounced this year especially because the loan quarter was so high. But I think if you look at it over time, if we don't get that kind of run rate, we're going to have to resize the business because that's what's needed to appear the right return.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Just separately, I guess, on the whole kind of broader foreclosure issue for the industry, I personally am surprised that it's kind of lasted this long. It feels like there's a lot of incentive for everyone to figure out some sort of settlement and move on. I know when you're in discussions it's hard to talk about these things publicly. But any clarity you can give on maybe timing of putting this issue behind the industry or maybe what needs to happen to get people at the table to hammer out an agreement here.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">It's hard to reflect on that, there's a lot of groups involved and you've seen them talking to press about what's going on, and we won't do that. What I will tell you though is we did a thorough review. We identified what we needed to do to make sure that we could erase from anybody's memory that there is any lack of precision, integrity, discipline in the process and we've restarted the process based on that and we dedicated lots of people, lots of work to make sure that there'll be no question about it. Resolving the types of things you're talking about will take some time. But the key is that we've actually done the work, completed it, brought in the outside review, brought in the inside review and are back working on it and working through this very difficult situation for the borrowers. So that separates where the regulatory and other issues away from the activity of starting to progress and the answer to that is yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And then just lastly with debit card, you're starting to have more banks come out publicly and says offsets. I think one bank said that they can offset it 50%, one bank said 100%, one bank's claiming it's illegal. Just any updated thoughts you have on that in terms of how this plays out when all is said and done?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I think what we've said in the past still stands over time. We have to mitigate all of it because we have to get the returns of business back to what we need. But in the short term the transition and as Chuck said in his comments, we'll be slower just because you loss revenue instantaneously and it takes a while. But the key things we've done and you've seen in the press report is we have restructured our account structure and during the course of 2011 it's out in the pilot state. It will ultimately roll through the entire customer base over the next three or four quarters. And that allows us to -- we think in the right way to recover the revenue that will then in '12 and 13 is that the structure goes through. And so I think that's our -- that'd be our statement sort of -- that'd be our clarity on sort of timing. '11 is a transition year. '12 we start to recover and it will take a little time. And as interest rates rise, we have to remember that interest rates are multitude of effect on that business, the low interest rate environment, the value deposits, then the fee side in it over time. So if interest rates rise, we're going to have to have disciplined pricing at our structure and the team has done that to gather back some of it there too.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Charles Noski</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Particularly with our scale.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">We'll go next to the site of Ed Najarian with ISI Group.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Edward Najarian - ISI Group Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">My first question has to do with credit. I guess we saw obviously improvement in the charge-off ratio and in MPAs, but 90-day delinquencies were flat and we saw only pretty modest improvement in 30-plus-day delinquencies. So I'm wondering if you have any comments sort of on your outlook for the pace of credit quality improvement going forward. Looking at the delinquency trends it seems like it's likely to slow down relative to prior quarters. Any comments there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Charles Noski</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I think the pace is slow in prior quarters only because in the grand scheme we've gone from $12 billion, this is the high point, down to $6 million in pure charge-offs now. But we continue to see the delinquencies improved. The entry levels, what's going in, the raw rates are solid, what's coming in the card business and especially if you look at the core portfolios that we got the run-off portfolios and the not run-off portfolios and some of these businesses even that you look at them and it's very solid. So we are encouraged on the consumer side and what we've seen an early-stage delinquencies in all of the portfolios. But the pace of improvements will slow only because we had a long way to come from. And if when you look in the group of commercial, you can look at our criticized assets. You're seeing them start to come down when you see charge-offs and that bodes well for future credit costs obviously. So it's slower but it's relentless and it will continue to improve. and if you look at the vintages, what I was saying earlier, if you look st the vintages of the underwriting we did in '08 especially like halfway through '08 and out, we had a prediction for unemployment, things like that in card and mortgage stuff. It's been worsened out as nobody would predicted it right at the time. But our vintage is actually performing better than they've predicted in a worst economic scenario. And so our confidence is as we move each quarter, this will continue to improve. But the pace will be slower just because we have a long way to come from.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Edward Najarian - ISI Group Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And then secondarily, just going back to Page 10 with all the one timers, we add that all back and get sort of a $0.17 core EPS level this quarter, excluding all those one timers, at annualized it's just $0.68. I guess the question would be given sort of that annualized core earnings run rate, and knowing that we've got some revenue headwinds on the way, you talked about lower NII and we know Durbin is on the way, is there any thought to launching somewhat of more broad-based efficiency improvement initiative over at least at some point over the next 12 months? I know you talked about the idea that credit-related operating costs and those 13,000 people would come out over time, but is there a desire to try to launch something more substantial in terms of efficiency enhancement or would you say there's just too much going on within the company right now to get into some kind of a plan like that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Let me, a couple of things. One is, in all our businesses we continue to manage it and reposition. so if you take our Global Banking and Markets business, the headcount for the year is sort of flattish but we have 1,000 more -- 800 to 1,000 more people working outside the United States and reduced inside United States and in Europe to fund that Asia growing, Latin America, the places. So we continue to reposition people even within the context of headcount being very, very flat. I'd say it's absolutely something we will continue to focus on. As expenses, we'll continue to focus on it across the company broadly. And as we shape the company more normally, I gave you the one group in mortgage, but it's actually broader. But let's just -- the additional people we put on in 2010 and then to we got mortgage, we got card business, we continue to get the dividend as you see the delinquencies in cost come down there. And then you've got in the commercial areas, we continue to collect and bring  criticized assets down. And then overall, we got to bring the overhead and this company down and the team we're working on that and we'll continue to embed that as we go through the next several quarters. You're exactly right, we're still settling this company in. We've got to make sure that we've got all the things settled in. And then so the timing of that is as we move through this year, we'll get more and more aggressive on that but right now we have to be careful to make sure that we don't have any backwards movement in terms of some of the improvements in risks and controls and getting the mortgage foreclosure. So we're trying to balance that. But we know how to take out costs, we've done it many times before and we'll continue to do that. And so what we really ought to do is get strong operating leverage as revenues do improve and there's still some headwinds, we agree with you, but that trading revenue this quarter is down and it will come back up and if it doesn't, we'll adjust the size of that platform to make it up for it. But as revenues improve, the key is to continue to make get the expenses to sort of stay in the flattish category even as revenues are coming back up and that's what the team is working on. Some place like that retail area, in the consumer brand system, we continue to downsize. I think we've done 250 branches. We'll continue to work on that as customer change takes place. This is all over the area but we are doing more broad-based work and we'll continue to do that. But there is a balance here just making sure that we keep the stability and the strength moving forward in reality of where we are in the cycle and some of these collection issues.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Edward Najarian - ISI Group Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So maybe a more formal plan is more like a 2012 event than a 2011 event?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I was maybe not clear out there. But we have a formal plan every month when we do our business reviews. So it's not as mysterious as leading it out and we drive it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Edward Najarian - ISI Group Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Finally, you've alluded a couple of times on this, once on this call and then in the prior call to potentially raising the dividend at some point in 2011. And I guess I'm wondering A, like some other banks are willing to, are you willing to disclose what you think your Basel III based tier 1 common ratio is? We'd be interested in that. And given that and your discussions with the regulators, what gives you confidence that you can raise the dividend this year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Charles Noski</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">On the Basel, what we have said is as each of the rules becomes effective at the end of this year, two in market-based risk rules and at the end of next year, three. At the day it becomes effective, with no implementation timeframe, we would have 8% or better in tier 01 common under the bank card rules. And so as you think about what we submit in these plans, you're submitting the standards of the current Basel I and the levels you have are end of things and we exceed those and then as we implement, we exceeded. So we have confidence what we've been done with the balance sheet now remains a balance sheet has reduced a lot of capital improvement for the year. And you can see on the slide earlier I mentioned in terms of Tier 1 improvement and things like that. So we put in plans. The regulators are looking at them as you know with everybody else. We did not contemplate something early this year, it's in the back half of the year. So it'd be very modest, but the idea is that it is consistent with the balance sheet to operating earnings, the work we've done this year to build Tier 1 Common ratio from 8.5, 8.6 this quarter, we feel confident that we got it. Now we still got to get through the approval and this was a bigger issue for us, three or four or five quarters ago but we cleaned up the balance sheet and restored the capital ratios to a point where it's pretty sizable and embedded in all of that is all the operating statistics and adverse scenarios and everything you've heard about. So we feel confident that we've asked for it, we'll see what happens with the regulators but it's because we've done a lot of hard work in 2010 selling businesses, reposition the franchise to get us there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Edward Najarian - ISI Group Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Can you tell me one more time, the 8% by the end of '11, what was that again?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">What we said is that as each of the rules becomes effective, remember there's more than just Basel III, there's Basel II. We are going -- the Basel II Rules, the market base risk rules and then the Basel III. As each of them becomes affected by Tier 1 common ratio under the rules as they become affected with no phase and periods would be above 800 basis points.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And we'll go next to the site of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Christoph Kotowski - Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I'm trying to navigate between Page 20 and Page 38. And when you put a number like $7 billion to $10 billion out there, it's just kind of natural to ask how did you come up with that. And so I'm wondering is the concept behind it that your risk is primarily in the bucket that's less than 13 payments? And the $7 billion to $10 billion would be like a quarter to a third of that amount there. Is that the guiding operating assumption behind the $7 billion to $10 billion?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Charles Noski</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Chris, unfortunately, the math is a bit more complex than that. I don't know if I'll be able to answer you. Certainly, it would be reasonable to think that the fewer payments that get made before a loan goes into default would suggest a high level of risk. I'd also refer you to Page 21 because as we did our array of different scenarios and looked at a set of assumptions and again these were guesses because we don't have any experience. But if you look at some of the significant differences between GSE and private label reps and warranty rights, we try to make different judgments around some of the criteria that you see on Page 21 to try to get a sense of what -- because those are important leverage points, materiality causation, disclosures, the rights to actually make claim presentations and the like, these are all pretty significant hurdles in our view and you've got to make some judgments about whether or not private label investors can aggregate and actually achieve and overcome those hurdles. And then you have to think about the performance and the characteristics of the portfolio on Page 38.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Christoph Kotowski - Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And then going back to Page 18, if you look at the new claim trends in the lower left, I noticed that there is an uptick in the pre-'05 claims and then the '05 claims and the '06 claims. And so it's early kind of pre-crisis vintages that seemed to be ticking up. A, is that a trend? And B, is that driven by the private label on monoline claims I assume?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Charles Noski</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Yes, the private label claims that we have mentioned here, I'm not sure one quarter drives a trend, Chris. I think you need to appreciate. Certainly we've seen this with both the monolines and the GSEs is that they don't tend to follow a chronological order. So you and I might think first they'll do pre-2005, then they do 2005, and 2006 and 2007, that hasn't been our experience. We've had new claim submissions kind of all over the map. And so it's certainly something we are watching but this is certainly impacted in the quarter by the claims that are described in the footnote 1 at the bottom of Page 18.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And the commentary to 1.9, that gives you some color as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Christoph Kotowski - Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And then just a little question, I noticed on the supplement Page 25, mortgage production revenues up from $70 billion to $81 billion, but production income was down. Is there a story behind that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Yes, Chris, we focused on the lost loan and the production is driven by the funding and that's just the difference. So production was up but the actual lost loans were down.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Charles Noski</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And margins as well. As rates came up and we thought about how to be competitive. And frankly, Chris, we are not driving for market share in this business. We are driving for solid risk management and good profitable performance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">We'll go next to the site of Glenn Schorr from Nomura.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So I hear you on the production revenue being booked when you lock a loan, can you give us an idea of how much of the pipeline you've got through between late third quarter and early fourth quarter. I guess the industry in general is down about 40% looking for first quarter. Is that in the ballpark of rate?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">We'll get back with you, Glenn. We don't have the number.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And then I noticed that there is a higher revenue mortgages held on balance sheet. Is that a trend we expect to continue or is that just a temporary -- securitization marks aren't great, a little balance sheet growth, a little room as capital grows?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Charles Noski</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I would say, Glenn, it's driven more by liquidity and the balance sheet management, interest rate risk management activities in our discretionary portfolio. So not necessarily view that as a trend. I mean we do look at the our liquidity and rates and the like.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">If you look 14 just in terms of core activities, Glenn, that $18 billion which includes the revenue which is on the balance sheet would be a $3.4 billion net increase, if you just took the residential as a whole discussion in the corner. So to address the corporate portfolio consumer stabilizes as we've said and continue to move forward and residential is more discretionary to what we do on a given day holding it except in our private banking and other areas where we hold those clients' loans because it's -- and we've always done.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">On the average balance sheet on 9 in the supplement, the yield on debt securities, first of all, the book went up and the yield went up a lot, all things considered given the environment, up 36 basis points. I'm just curious, is that just taken a little duration risk is you had to spike up in the 10-year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Charles Noski</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">We can get back to you, but we're not taking any different duration risk than we've been all years. So I think it's probably just -- we'll get back to you with the exact answer.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I'm not sure if you have disclosed it. But have you ever disclosed the average duration on the securities portfolio?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I think we've given you a pretty broad description on that 10-K, Glenn, but I think from quarter-to-quarter we don't.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Charles Noski</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Our strategy during the year is that to keep it relatively -- it's four, four and a half years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Four or five years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Just a follow-up on your comments on the repricing efforts across the deposit franchise, you'd mentioned couple of states upfront and then over the next three to four quarters roll throughout the rest of the platform. This might be a simple question, but what things will you monitor to know if it's working or is this charging ahead and plan being put in place or do you watch for leakage and things like that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">We monitor the customer reactions to the price points and the various things. I would say that the philosophy, the account structure, the five or six core accounts, I don't think will change. It will be what -- they can't balance minimums or the price point on particular elements. So as you think about it, think about it is a relentless push to get through and redo everything. The question whether you pay $9 a month if you want paper statements or $8 a month if there's a kind of thing will test in that. So it's more the price points around the structure and the acceptance. Now, remember one of those accounts in the new structures is the account which is 35% to 40% of the sales today that's been in the market fully in all the states now for six months or eight months and is very well received. And especially among the obvious people you'd point to, the younger people, people who are particularly happy to use the seller online platform we have, chat, text the whole nine yards.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">We'll go next to the site of Mike Mayo with CLSA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">The possible upper range of $7 billion to $10 billion, is that before or after tax?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Charles Noski</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Before.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">So after tax would be maybe $0.45 to $0.65 to book value?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Charles Noski</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Well our statutory tax rate, including state taxes, is, say, 37%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">So if we think about it on a book value basis, this might hurt to give 10 billion shares to take 37% of the $7 billion to $10 billion divided by 10 billion shares would be a hit of around $0.45 to $0.65 to book value to clean up the issue. I just want to make sure I understand what you're saying.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Charles Noski</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I think the thing to think about, again, we think this is a possible range we're trying to respond to some investor concerns about given the broad range of estimates that are out there, we try to bring some color to that. Again we think this happens over a number of years in terms of the resolution of this. But I'm not going to dispute your math given that it's a pre-tax number. It's after our accruals. We think it's going to occur over a number of years. We don't have a view as to where we will fall in that range. So we said it's probably more than zero that's why you expect to have some level of future provisions. We'll have to see and we just don't have enough experience in the portfolio to try to estimate anymore precisely the math.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And can you confirm that this is tax-deductible?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Charles Noski</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Excuse me?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Are these costs tax-deductible?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Charles Noski</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And then if you could elaborate on the statement, the fewer payments made before default, the higher level of risk. In other words, you said 58% of the non-GSE loans that defaulted made at least 25 payments. I just would like to understand the significance of that a little more.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Charles Noski</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">The only comment is and I mean this is a very rough assessment is that you would imagine to the extent that there are fewer and fewer payments between origination and default might suggest that those might be areas of particular risk when it comes to reps and warranties. I wouldn't read anything more into the statement than that, Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And then sticking to the same topic, Bank of New York on their conference call, they said that this is likely to be resolved in the next few weeks either it's settled, there's increased oversight, over you I suppose, or that an extreme scenario of the service would be replaced. Do you agree with those scenarios? And what's the timeline?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">We don't have any idea what they said.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And then separate topic. Compensation was up 5% linked quarter and you didn't highlight any one-time items on Page 10. Is there anything unusual there? Seasonal, it seems like big comp quarter given the revenues.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Charles Noski</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Remember, there was fourth quarter severance and some benefits adjustments across the whole associate population just from an accounting standpoint in terms of the comp to revenue statistics that investment banks that people like to focus on. We ended the year kind of in the mid-30s, I think perhaps 37%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And then also the revenues GUM were up quarter-to-quarter and that drives it to.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Charles Noski</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And of course, remember with GUM that those are financial advisors, they operate and they get paid on a grid basis. And so as they have a more and more successful year during the year, they move to different measures in that grid that will award them for volume.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">What was the actual loan utilization numbers third quarter to fourth quarter? And how much did the increase in loan syndication's linked quarter contribute to your loan growth? And just a little more color behind your comment, Brian, that you thought things were kind of picking up.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I gave the number for the middle market book, Mike. And it was around 31% in a stable third quarter and fourth quarter. That's not -- in the large corporate book, you have the things that you could hold the loan and settle down and things like that, the middle market book that doesn't happen. Because this is loans that -- side of the company from $2 million of revenues is up $1 billion, so it's more core activity. But if you separate all that out, what we're really seeing is in the November, October November, December timeframe versus the last eight quarters, you're starting to see activity starts to move forward and grow a little bit here and there. And we have real estate coming out from some of these books and stuff. So the activity is 31% stable. The activity in the core middle market, I don't think it's affected by that. That was more on a large corporate book and that would be in GCIB segment under GBM. So this is just core activity, Mike. And believe me, it's not robust and growing at x percentage, just stable and moving forward a little bit which is better than it has been in a while.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">The next question from the site of Meredith Whitney from Meredith Whitney Advisory.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Meredith Whitney - Meredith Whitney Advisory Group LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">My first is to Brian, as there's so much movement and so much really structural change in so many of your businesses, could you talk about your budgeting of talent and headcount. So the last couple of years you've moved people into the collection efforts and the foreclosure restructuring modification efforts. As credit quality starts to improve, where do you move those people? As it looks like U.S. FICC is under a structural change and so much of European FICC is under structural change, where do you move those people? Can you talk about that on a one-, two-, three-year outlook, please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Taking the basic businesses we operate outside of the United States which should be the Global Wealth Management business and the Global Corporate Investment Banking and the Global Markets business, in Asia, Latin America, and Africa and EMEA, we have grown headcount by 1,000 and overall headcount is flat in our GCIB, in our GBM, the Global Banking Market space, to give you a sense. So I'd expect those trends to continue, so we're always adding new talent out of the business schools and we hire a robust class at business schools and undergraduates, so we always do merit. But what we're doing is shifting the talent to where the bigger growth opportunity is while still maintaining our leading presence in the United States and all those categories. So that is a trend I think would continue. And then in the context that Tom has in the third quarter, fourth quarter once we're around a series of headcount reductions overall and then we're adding people back. If you think about our risk management organization, for example, we had also grow that outside United States to help make sure we monitor the risk and manage that business well. When you go in the GUM, the answer is pretty clear that we want to grow our financial advisor accountant and our wealth management bank account and our private banker account and we've done that by 500 to 600 people this year and with that you should expect that to continue. And I honestly would say that, that growth rate this year was somewhat disappointing to me. I mean, not from expense budget but from a growth of the franchise we'd expect that number to be stronger. And we have seen attrition is an all-time and our recruiting efforts are picking up but we need to grow that because our biggest opportunity inside the United States is around the Wealth Management space even though we got $4.3 billion in revenues and next year's competitor might be $1 billion below that. If you look at commercial banking stable, if you look at the consumer business, generally we continue to manage down the headcount, in the Card businesses, the credit has gotten better. In the Deposits business, I'd expect it to continue to come down, going to the question earlier about sort of structural change. And then at the mortgage, you're running 55,000 people and I think the business, three years out, soon this is all behind us. The other thing is the 30,000, 35,000 person business and maybe very robust production higher than but it's a different side and it's just going to take us time to get through. I think that covered each of the business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Meredith Whitney - Meredith Whitney Advisory Group LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Put back worth which you've well detailed, what about the underwriter risks that we have, the GSE risk, the private label risk, the monoline risk, what about the underwriter risk, can you comment on that and how you would reserve towards that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Charles Noski</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">We really don't see that as a significant risk, Meredith.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Meredith Whitney - Meredith Whitney Advisory Group LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Moving from a four-deposit base system to one deposit base system, what's the timetable there? And I assume you need to run the redundant system, so it's more expensive to become ultimately less expensive?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Charles Noski</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">That would be the goal as to go more expense and less expense.  But also we have products that are frankly unavailable in parts of our franchise just because of the all things that have been going on, we're now at the point we can actually do this. The planning is -- part of the expenses in the latter part of the year in Deposits business has been to start to work.  It's an 18-month process so it would occur in '11 and then in '12. But there is absolutely an expense in the simplification value to this but the real value is one of the four systems operate in a lot of franchise and it works and that's been going on for about two or three years. But the real value of all this is to actually give 100% of our customers, 100% of our product capabilities with absolute flow and that simplifies both our associates' life, our customers' life and also really unified our franchise. So there is both the takeout value but there is really an enhanced value in terms of each time we develop a consumer change, we have to do it 4x.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Meredith Whitney - Meredith Whitney Advisory Group LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Chuck, you went through a comment on your reserves and you mentioned that you adjusted your home price assumptions. From what to what please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Charles Noski</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">I think we'll have to get back to you on that one, Meredith. It's kind of a year-end assessment as it related to certain of our real estate portfolios. But we'll get back to you on that. The other two or three adjustments and those types just are based on the same statistics you looked at. We objectively tie them to another metrics and then adjust. And as those came up a little less than what's expected in the last couple of months, we adjust them down. So it's not some internal forecast either adjusting based on the outside forecast. I mean, we can get you the numbers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">One more question. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">We'll take our final question from the site of David Hilder from Susquehanna.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>David Hilder - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Just a question, you mentioned that there were some litigation expense in the Deposit business. And I was just kind of wondering what group would give rise to that in that business?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">The usual cases and stuff like that. I think there's nothing in particular that we talked about externally. But we have a series of cases around -- that everybody has around activities in there and this quarter we proved part of it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Thanks, everyone.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Charles Noski</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">And this concludes today's teleconference.

[Operator Instructions] And it is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Stitt. Please go ahead, sir.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Kevin Stitt</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning. Before Brian Moynihan and Chuck Noski begin their comments, let me remind you that this presentation does contain some forward-looking statements regarding both our financial condition and financial results, and that these statements involve certain risks that may cause actual results in the future to be different from our current expectations. And these factors include, among other things, changes in economic conditions, changes in interest rates, competitive pressures within the financial services industry and legislative or regulatory requirements that may affect our businesses. For additional factors, please see our press release and SEC documents.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">And also joining us this morning as he did last -- three months ago will be Neil Cotty, our Chief Accounting Officer. And with that, let me turn it over to Brian.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning, everyone. Before we get started this morning, I want to spend a couple of minutes on announcements that occurred this morning other than earnings. Obviously, we will cover in this call the announcement with the FSA/Assured on the monoline. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">But on the leadership side, I just wanted to talk through what we've done there. Last year, Chuck came to me and due to an illness of a close family member in California where he has lived, it was going to be clear that he may not be able to move, and we decided to continue to talk about the situation. He had made a commitment to move at the end of the school year obviously because he has a daughter who\u2019s at senior high school. But with that, it became clear as we moved through this quarter that Chuck could not move. So I asked Chuck to take another leadership position that could help us work on some client matters, matters in the mortgage company and help them transition to new CFO. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">So what we announced this morning was to have Bruce Thompson take over for Chuck as CFO effective -- and that transition will be completed by the end of the second quarter. And Chuck will continue as a great judge and perspective to help Bruce continue to learn the tasks. Chuck has served as a CFO at a time when we had a tremendous transformation on our financials. He's been a great partner, and we're glad that we came up with something that worked for everybody. Bruce, many of you know, he's been a Chief Risk Officer. He's done a great job for us since last year doing that. He manned our Capital Markets business for Tom and ran Leveraged Finance and many other things for the company over his 15-year career here. As Chief Risk Officer, he may assist through a difficult situation including, as you'll see in some of the pages later, a great reposition of the balance sheet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">In addition to those two changes, we also announced that Gary Lynch will join us as Global Head Of Legal, Compliance and Regulatory Relations. My judgment was that we want to continue to add to the quality and capabilities of our management team. As Gary became available, his reputation in the Street in legal circles and regulators is well known. He has also been the Head of Enforcement at the SEC. And the relationships he has around the world, he spent the last couple of years in London, will help us outside the United States. He'll join us when his garden leave expires later this year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">So with the management changes behind us, let's shift to the quarterly results. With that, I'll start on Slide 4. Rather than get into some of the detail on the page, let me just give you the themes for this quarter, which are similar to those relayed to you in early March. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">The franchise that we've built over the last 230 years in this company continues to deliver, and you can see that in the numbers and the statistics this morning. Obviously, the Mortgage business is still in need of continued repositioning, and we continue to work on that. But what you've seen is solid customer activity across the board. Our focus on changing the strategy in the Consumer Deposits business has led to the first quarter of net checking account growth, a return to profit in that business, improved customer satisfaction across the board, the best retention of customers in that business in many quarters. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In other areas, we continue to grow our FA headcount. We've had strong referrals in the businesses across to each other. The deposit growth through the whole franchise has gone over $1 trillion in total deposits. And as the economy has improved a bit, we're starting to see some loan growth on a core basis in the Middle Market business with David Darnell. And we'll touch on some of that later, but the key theme is the franchise continues to deliver.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">As you back up to the second point, revenue rose from last quarter. Expenses were flat on a gross basis to $20 billion, including goodwill, and I'll cover it a little later, up $500 million more on the core business. But the absolute levels are elevated, and I'm just going to talk about what we're doing about that in a few minutes. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Overall, earnings improved to $2 billion or $0.17, but we're still impacted by charges as we continue to pull out through the financial crisis. We had $5 billion in charges this quarter we absorbed, and we also had $3 billion between reserve releases and higher private equity to the good side.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">When we talked to you at Investor Day, we said we were shooting for pretax, pre-provision profits as we normalized to $45 billion to $50 billion. This quarter, Chuck will walk you through the one-time items, but if you adjust for those, you'll get to a number of approximately $10 billion, which is up from last quarter, and I think puts us in a position that we can see clearly how we build a bridge to the $45 billion to $50 billion level as we normalize. That normalization requires the interest rate environment to change more fundamentally to more normalized environment. We've got to take the costs down across the board. As the economy continues to plug away, we'll continue to make progress in other revenue sources.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In addition, one of the things we talked about at Investor Day was the need to continue to drive down the legacy assets and risk in the company. During this quarter, we took care of one of the monoline exposures. We absorbed the home price fall-off, and we also continued to have our loan portfolio run off across all categories of portfolio we identified for you a couple quarters go. This quarter, that portfolio ran down by about $6 billion, excluding the government-matured loans, which we show you in the Appendix. The cost of that to the P&amp;L was about $1.9 billion pretax this quarter. Again, Tom and his team did a good job reducing legacy trading assets and we continue to make progress in that area.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">When you look at the balance sheet, we continue to position the balance sheet, our reserves even after the release remains strong, 4.3% to loans, 1.63x trailing to charge-offs. We made progress improving the capital ratios, lowering our risk-weighted assets again, growing liquidity and reducing long-term debt. All those important metrics we identified for you a few months ago.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We also continue to move forward to take advantage of the opportunities we identified for you. We have a great opportunity in this company in the Affluent and Mass Affluent segments and between Joe Price and Sallie Krawcheck and the team, they continue to see good growth there. We continue to have opportunities in our international capabilities, and I'll describe the work we've done there over the last quarter. And we continue to have opportunities in the business, that will rebound as the economy continues to move forward in the Investment Management and Capital Markets areas, and we had solid quarters there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">And again, this quarter, we continue to simplify the franchise. This quarter, we made progress. We sold a European small business card portfolio. We have Balboa under contract. That will close late this quarter, early next. In addition, we continue to reduce our private equity positions across the board, and we continue to sell some other small pieces to continue to fine-tune this franchise.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">When we get to the broader economy this quarter, what we saw is that the customers' health continues to move forward. Delinquencies were down across all portfolios, consumer spending continued to increase this quarter over last, in 2011 over 2010. In March, it increased 7% to give you an example, about 1\u00bd% of that would have been gas price increases, the rest is sort of fundamental customer purchases moving forward. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We see loan demand in select areas and loan stability across the board, absent the runoff. Our Affluent clients continue to take more risk in the market. And we've seen growth in the area there, and the capital markets remain robust.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">So enough with that, let's drop to Page 5 and get into some of the specific results for the quarter. On Slide 5, you can see we can start with the capital ratios. We told you at the conference, our share return model requires us to focus on building our balance sheet with a strong reserve position, driving optimization of risk-weighted asset position and building capital through 2011, 2012 as we move from Basel I to Basel II to Basel 2.5 to Basel III. This quarter reflects the continued progress. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">The tangible common equity ratio increased to 6.1%, above the level we believe that -- of the risk inherent to run the company. The focus that we also shared with you is driving tangible book value per share. We moved that to $13.21 this quarter as you can see in the upper right-hand corner of the slide. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Our regulatory cap ratios continue to improve. We had a fairly sizable change in the DTA allowance period for regulatory capital treatment that caused a 27-basis points decline before we got the quarter started. But even with that, we still made progress. The Tier 1 common ratio was up 4 basis points or 31 basis points, not taking into account the adjustment. And the Tier 1 was up 8 basis points gross. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On the lower right, you can see we made progress by continuing to reduce RWA. And as we've talked to you, we had significant mitigation coming later in the year in Basel calculations after planned implementation of technology, risk models and other risk management opportunities we've been working on for the last couple of years. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">All this is critical in our ability to meet the Tier 1 Basel III common ratio goal of 8% at year end 2012 as if Basel III was fully implemented, and to move forward on capital management later this year and next year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Now let me go to Page 6, and then just step back and think about the progress first quarter of 2010 versus 2011 in the core balance sheet of this company. As you can see on this page, overall assets down 3%, our RWA is down 6%, our deposits are up 4% or $44 billion, our long-term debt has been reduced $77 billion, which is significant and has a significant benefit on our margin. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Importantly, you can see our tangible common shareholders' equity is up $16 billion. Our Tier 1 common equity's up $8 billion. And you can see the rest of the statistics on this page. So in a year's time frame, we've been able to significantly lower the risk, increase the capital and increase the statistics on reserve coverage while at the same time managing the customer franchise.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As we move to the businesses, I just want to reflect quickly on those, and then I'll let Chuck take you through the detail on the numbers. On Slide 7, you can see the overall picture. It's a pretty simple picture. You can see all the businesses have moved back to profitably except our Mortgage business, and we'll talk in some detail about that later on.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As you go on each of the businesses, let's first take our Deposit businesses starting on Page 8. The deposits team produced earnings this quarter of $355 million, and that was versus a loss in the fourth quarter. They had higher revenue and lower litigation expense compared to the fourth quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Remember that in this business, the fourth quarter was kind of the low point because the regulatory items affecting the Deposits business, i.e., the Reg E and overdraft are fully in this business. Our Durbin charges will go into our Card segment later this year if it becomes effective. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">The return on tangible equity for our Deposits business this quarter was 25%, which is above the rate of our early rates obviously, but we expect to go higher as the business continues to recover. As deposit balances were up $5 billion or 4% annualized, the cost of retail deposits, both in this business and our Wealth Management business combined, were down 4 basis points to 33 basis points.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Importantly, new accounts reflect continued focus on quality relationships and retention. As a matter of fact, we're seeing the lowest attrition in accounts we've seen in three years or more. In this quarter, we saw the first net account growth based on the change in strategies that Joe Price and his team are accomplishing in five quarters. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Account closures are down, and our customer focus continues to work. Early results in our pilots to reposition our franchise based on all the regulatory changes in a customer-driven analysis are still in early rollout, but exceeding our expectations. In adding a preferred customer solutions group, our Platinum Privileges offerings, as we call it, has worked well. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On the expense side, the team is working. Branches are down 200 over the last five quarters. Our cost to deposits ratio that we showed you in early March went down from 264 basis points. That\u2019s all the cost of operating a franchise over the deposits to 250, which shows continued growth. Our active online accounts exceeded 30 million, a record for this company. Our mobile users are up 55% first quarter '10 to first quarter '11 to 6.8 million mobile users. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As we\u2019ve switched to Card Services, that business earned $1.7 billion in the quarter on improved credit quality. Its revenue is down as the portfolio keeps repositioning as we continue to run down the book for the loans we don't want in that business, and the lower yields did a seasonal decline in retail volume. The unit did benefit by reserve release, but the earnings are normalizing, and we\u2019ll see that happen over the next few quarters. The retail volumes are down from the fourth quarter, but as I said earlier, customer usage of cards has gone up year-over-year by in the 5%, 6%, 7% range, depending on the month. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Our net loss rates broke another level here as we filed below 8% for the first time in a while, from the peak of nearly 14% on card losses in U.S. credit card book. New accounts in our U.S. credit card book were up 26% in the fourth quarter in the highest level in six quarters. In credit quality, there's no origination that's very strong. So as you think about our core Consumer businesses, we returned to profit deposits, and we ought to expect to keep driving that forward. And our Card business continues to improve and both have upside as the interest rate environment and economy continues to stabilize.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We move to the next page, Slide 9 in our Wealth Management businesses. The Global Wealth Management team turned in $531 million after-tax, up 69% from solid fourth quarter results, but driven by an 8% increase in revenue and lower provision for credit cost. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Our pretax margin in this business, showing the value of the innovative model across all the various products, is reaching nearly 19%. And the return on economic equity was 30%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">The growth in margin, as I said, is reflective of the loan deposits growth, which grew 5% in the quarter. And it demonstrates the customers who want to integrate their finances with us, and that loan deposit growth led to NII growing 10% from the fourth quarter 2010.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Now many times people ask if that money is just money sitting on the sidelines. But during this quarter, we've also seen the activity related to the investment side of the house grow nicely. Client balances grew 2%, and that's on a $2 trillion base to give you a sense. So it's $45 billion in growth in clients and the new product flows of about $14 billion in long-term assets under management, were all good performance by this unit.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">The growth in Financial Advisors continue to be steady, 184 new Financial Advisors were added. We continue to have record low attrition in our advisor forums. And referrals by this unit, which is sort of a Lynch Pandora referral strategy, continue to be strong and remain healthy with the other businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On Slide 9, we moved to one of the -- at the bottom of Slide 9, we talk about one of the core businesses we had, which is Middle Market, Small Business Lending, which turned in another quarter of $923 million of earnings. They're down slightly as they went from a release of provision to actually having provision this quarter. The return on tangible equity in this business is 18% for this quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Average C&amp;I balances were up 2%, and that's concentrated in the middle market space. It offsets declines in the Commercial Real Estate business and Dealer Financial Services business. Average deposits also grew 2%. The Asset Qualities businesses was very strong through the cycle and continues to improve.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">One of the things that you often ask about that we saw here, was that we saw revolver utilization of our companies move from 32% in the fourth quarter to 35%, which shows the companies are using credit ever so slightly. Remember that normalized to that level, it\u2019s probably in the mid-40s, so we've got work to go ahead of us there still.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We move to Slide 10, move to our large corporate and capital markets and sales and trading team in Global Banking and Markets. They earned $2.1 billion for the fourth quarter. Returns on tangible capital of business were 28%. The revenue was up 44% from the fourth quarter, driven by increases in sales and trading, a robust quarter investment banking and steady corporate banking revenue driven by treasury management growth of about 5%. Corporate loans were up $3 billion for the quarter, about 12% annualized, driven by growth in our International Lending business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Now one of the interesting things here is our international market share in some of our businesses is now stronger than our U.S. market share, which shows the effort the team has made to grow across the world with its global client. In Equity Capital Markets advisory, we actually had higher shares outside the U.S. this quarter than we did inside the U.S., which shows good progress on our international strategy. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">And now we move to the business that we continue to have to do a lot of work on, and that's our Consumer Real Estate Services business. As you know, we split this business in two parts to focus the executives in the business to concentrate on two pieces: Barbara Desoer and her team to concentrate on the Front End business; and Terry Laughlin and the team to concentrate on the Legacy Asset business and running down. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">In the business, the Legacy Asset business obviously had a significant loss. And the go forward business had a slight profit, and Chuck will talk you through that later. Our production levels in mortgage banking fell to $56 billion, but we maintained our market share. To deal with the fall off, we announced today and have been reducing headcount by approximately 3,500 people. About 2,000 of those are contractors in that business and about 1,500 are teammates. This is all in the good side of the house in Barbara's side of the business. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On the Legacy side, we continue to plug resources to get through the backlog and modifications and foreclosures. During the quarter, we modified 64,000 loans, bringing us to over 840,000 loans modified in the last few years. On our Legacy side, as you saw in our press release, we settled the exposures, one of them major monoline insurers, and Chuck will cover that later.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Again and after the review the regulators conducted late last fall and our self-assessment, we have made significant progress in implementing the changes and solution on short sales, deeds in lieu and foreclosures, and we'll complete about 70,000 of those in this quarter. The cost of delay in foreclosures and assessments related to that is reflected in the P&amp;L this quarter as is increased servicing cost in our MSR valuation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">As we move to the subject of cost, which is something we focused on, you can see on Slide 12 that you can see that we\u2019ve laid out for you sort of the fourth quarter and the first quarter in terms of the overall cost. There was about $20 billion in reported cost, but on a core basis, we had about a $500 million increase from quarter-to-quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We know that we need to do more on cost, and we'll continue to work on those. If you look at the base run rate's approximately $17 billion, and this is the run rate we've been facing consistent with what Chuck told you at the Investor Day about a $70 billion number. So we've been managing cost to try to run it flat as the incremental one-time costs continue to hit us on a given quarter. But the way we're managing that has been managing headcount. Overall headcount grew on a point-to-point basis from December 31 to March 31 about 0.3%. That's 0.3% or 2,700 people across the 285,000 to 288,000 people. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">With the Mortgage business and the Legacy side adding 2,700 people and the rest of the company going down by 2,000. That 2,000 reduction is even with the investments we're making in small business bankers out in international capabilities, financial advisers and many other areas. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Our efficiency ratio\u2019s at 75%. It\u2019s down from 92% in the fourth quarter, but that is not the progress we'd like to see. We expect that to continue to recover as the legacy assets and some of the charges go down in the high 50s, low 60s, which is where we were earlier in 2010. But we need to do more than show we can hold expenses flat or reduce them as revenue rises, deliver the returns in this business in the company we need to do. To do that, as we told you at Investor Day, we continue to finish off with all the integrations, and that will give us the time, the so-called peace dividend in the effort to continue to drive this company forward. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We told you we could get back to the 55% efficiency ratio. We have launched an effort this week using outside teammates who\u2019ve worked with other companies in a significant amount, an internal team called New BAC, which will continue to work to take all the work in this company, examine it and see the work that doesn't add value to our customers or teammates and move it out of this company. We'll work on this effort for the next several months. It takes two phases and leads us all the way into 2012. The first phase completes late this fall, and we'll continue to implement immediately thereafter to get the expense savings and keep the run rate down as the revenue and the economy recovers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">With that general overview, let me turn it over to Chuck to take you through and detail the quarter. Chuck?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Charles Noski</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Thanks, Brian. I appreciate your kind words, and I'm looking forward to continuing to work with you and the senior management team in my new role as Vice Chairman. I think Bruce will do a great job as the next Chief Financial Officer. And also Gary Lynch, who will be joining us later in the year, will be a terrific addition to Bank of America. As some of you may know, I worked with Gary during the five years I served on the board of directors of Morgan Stanley. And I found him to be a first-rate executive.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">With that, let's turn to the slides and begin on Slide 13. For the quarter, as Brian said, we reported $2 billion of net income or $0.17 a share after preferred dividends. There were several significant items during the quarter, which are detailed on Slide 14. Representations and warranties provision in the first half was $1 billion, of which slightly more than half was associated with the GSEs and the remainder was related primarily to a recent experience with a monoline. The provision related to the GSEs was driven by higher estimated repurchase rates, along with the further deterioration in the home pricing index, what we call HPI in the quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">If you recall, when we announced our agreement with the GSEs earlier this year and adjusted the liability for future losses, I noted that there could be further refinements from a number of factors. A major factor in our estimate of the liability for future losses is the performance of HPI, which declined this quarter and impacts the severity of losses in our reps and warranties liability.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">The credit market unstructured liabilities under deferred value option resulted in a negative adjustment of $586 million, reflecting a tightening of our credit spreads compared to a negative adjustment of $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter and is reported in other income.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Equity investment gains during the quarter included a $1.1 billion gain from an investment in connection with the related IPO in the first quarter and reflected both the sale of shares as well as the fair value mark on the remaining shares we still hold. We have $546 million in gains on the sale of securities during the quarter. Trading-related income included a negative DVA impact of $357 million due to wider debt spreads.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Excluding fees paid to external legal service providers, litigation expense this quarter was $940 million, principally associated with mortgage-related matters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">During the quarter, there were various mortgage assessments and waivers accrued for several areas of exposure driven by the foreclosure delays, which totaled $874 million, including $548 million for compensatory fees that we expect to be assessed by the GSEs as well as costs incurred during the foreclosure process that we do not expect to recover.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Also included in the first quarter, as Brian mentioned, was approximately $1 billion of expense related to retirement eligible stock-based compensation awards, so-called FAS 123R, that we have every year at this time. And merger related and restructuring charges were $202 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Credit loss reserves were reduced by $2.2 billion in the quarter versus $1.7 billion in the fourth quarter. The current period reserve number included $1.6 billion of reserve increases related to the purchase credit impaired portfolio. One item not on this slide, but which I want to highlight for you is our effective tax rate that this quarter was 26.3%. At this time, we would expect the rate for the rest of the year to be around 30%, plus or minus unusual items like a charge for the U.K. rate reductions expected later this year or more valuation allowance released benefits like we've seen during the last couple of years. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">You may recall that we wrote down a portion of our deferred tax asset last year in the third quarter due to the 1% U.K. tax rate reduction, resulting in a charge after tax of nearly $400 million. It looks like the U.K. is considering two more 1% tax rate reductions, which could impact the third quarter of this year. So we are expecting a charge income tax expense of nearly $800 million upon enactment of those rate changes. Because we would just be reducing deferred tax assets that are disallowed at the margin, the $800 million charge would not affect our regulatory capital levels.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">On Slide 15, you can see that average loans were down $1.6 billion from the fourth quarter while average deposits increased more than $15 billion. Deposits remains a good story of growth as consumer balances grew, Wealth Management clients continued to do more business with us and Commercial customers continued to prefer to hold rather than invest cash. In line with our comments over the past few months, ending long-term debt dropped $14 billion, and we expect that decline to continue. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">As you can see on Slide 16, loans at the end of the quarter, excluding net charge-offs and run-off activity, were up $2.9 billion. Consumer loans were relatively flat. Commercial loans x real estate were up $3.5 billion or 1.4%, driven primarily by growth in Asia and EMEA. And commercial real estate loans declined $2 billion or 4.1% as reductions in higher risk assets continue to offset new originations.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Let's turn to net interest income on Slide 17. Net interest income on an FTE basis was $12.4 billion, down $312 million from the fourth quarter. The impact of lower hedge income, lower consumer loan balances and yields and fewer days in the quarter were offset partially by a reduction in long-term debt and other items. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Our average earning assets for the quarter were down $14 billion, mainly due to reduced customer financing activity in the repo area. Average consumer loans were down as additional runoff in the Card and Home Equity portfolios more than offset retained mortgage originations. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Average commercial loans were relatively flat as decreases in real estate and U.S. Commercial were partially offset by increases in both core loan and trade finance activity in our non-U.S. Corporate Banking business, reflecting our growing international footprint. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">As we've said for the past few quarters, we expect net interest income to be down again in the second quarter and anticipate stabilization in the second half of the year. We are also on track to lower our long-term debt footprint by 15% to 20% by the end of 2011, relative to third quarter 2010 levels.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Turning to Slide 18. Card revenue was down almost $300 million from the fourth quarter, results due mainly to the seasonal decline in interchange. Decreases in retail spending were 6% versus the prior quarter, and versus the prior year reflected an increase of 6%. Card revenue was down 7% from a year ago, due to the impact of the CARD Act as the provisions became effective throughout 2010.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">On Slide 19, we show service charges were flat with the fourth quarter, but down 21% from a year ago due to overdraft policy changes, which as you know, were fully embedded in our results as of the fourth quarter of last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Let me say a couple of things that you should note before we move away from retail banking driven revenue. Consumer spending is up, account closures are down. Quality sales remained strong, deposits grew and employment levels are higher, which all point to improving performance in our Retail businesses in future periods.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Mortgage banking income on Slide 20 improved by $2 billion from the fourth quarter as lower reps and warranties provision was partially offset by lower production volumes in margin as well as less favorable net MSR hedge results. Production volume in first mortgage of $57 billion, was down 33% in line with the drop in the overall market size from the fourth quarter, while lock volumes were down 45%. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">MSR performance net of hedges was negligible this quarter versus a positive $257 million last quarter. The capitalization rate for the consumer mortgage MSR asset ended the quarter at 95 basis points versus 92 basis points in the fourth quarter. Given the level of interest rates and our lower lock pipeline, we forecast production levels will be lower over the near term.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Turning to Slide 21. You can see the total reps and warranties provision in the quarter was $1 billion down from $4.1 billion from the prior quarter. Much of the decrease was due to the impact of our agreements with the GSEs in the fourth quarter. The $1 billion provision in the first quarter dealt principally with the GSEs and recent experience with the monoline. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">On that note as Brian made reference to this morning, we announced an agreement with Assured Guaranty to resolve all of the monolines outstanding and potential repurchase claims related to alleged reps and warranties breaches involving certain first- and second-lien residential mortgage-backed securitization trusts where Assured provided financial guaranty insurance. The agreement covers combined original collateral exposure of approximately $35.8 billion with the combined principal at risk of approximately $10.9 billion. The agreement includes a cash payment of approximately $1.1 billion to Assured as well as a loss sharing reinsurance arrangement that has a current estimated fair market value of approximately $500 million. Approximately $1.1 billion of that was reserved for these potential repurchase claims at the end of December with the remaining liability recognized in the first quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">This settlement gets behind us a sizable piece of home equity exposure along with some first-lien exposure. We currently estimate the upper end of the possible loss range related to non-GSEs to remain at around $7 billion to $10 billion over existing accruals. Any reduction in our previously disclosed estimated range resulting from reserve accruals in this quarter were largely offset by the impact of HPI deterioration during the first quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">As a reminder, this estimated range does not represent our estimate of a probable loss and is based on current assumptions that are necessarily subject to change. The liability for reps and warranties ended the quarter at $6.2 billion compared to $5.4 billion in the prior quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Our unresolved repurchase requests increased $2.9 billion to $13.6 billion due to an increase in submissions from the GSEs on both remaining countrywide originations not covered by the agreements we announced in January and legacy Bank of America originations. Part of the increase was the result of lower submissions in the fourth quarter as we finalized the GSE agreements.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">On Slide 22, we've outlined in more detail the organizational changes we announced in the last quarter for our former Home Loans and Insurance business. And on Slide 23, we split out for you what we now call Consumer Real Estate Services into three pieces to provide a way to better understand the financial results and track our progress in those activities. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Home Loans and Insurance, as you can see, made $130 million this quarter and includes loan production activities. Our servicing of current loans, insurance operations and consumer real estate services, home equity portfolio not included in the legacy asset servicing portfolio. Insurance earnings drove the results given the low levels of customer mortgage application activity in the quarter and the cost we incurred to fulfill the outstanding pipeline left over from the fourth quarter's low rate environment. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Legacy Asset Servicing lost $2.5 billion and is responsible for servicing delinquent loans and managing the runoff and exposures related to selected residential mortgage, home equity and discontinued product loan portfolios. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">The LAS results represent the net cost of legacy exposures, including reps and warranties provision, litigation cost, financial results of the home equity loan portfolios allocated to Legacy Asset Servicing and financial results of the Legacy Asset Servicing portfolio service for others. The LAS portfolios include both current and delinquent loans that met standards defined for inclusion in Legacy Asset Servicing. The other column is essentially the results of management of the MSR and includes the change in the value of the MSRs net of hedges. We will continue to refine how we present this information going forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay, now back to earnings on Slide 24. Our activity with Wealth Management clients is producing revenue that achieved post merger highs, which is where we generate the bulk of investment and brokerage revenues. Investment in brokerage revenue was up $222 million or 8% from the fourth quarter due to higher market levels, long-term assets under management and higher transactional activity. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Asset-managed fees were a record $1.5 billion, up 6% from the fourth quarter and brokerage fees were also a record, approximately $1.6 billion, up 9% from the fourth quarter. Total client balances, including Merrill Edge, grew $47 billion to $2.3 trillion during the quarter as a result of market activity and strong flows into long-term asset management products.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Sales and trading revenue on Slide 25 of $4.9 billion, which includes both net interest income and noninterest income, increased approximately 93% from the fourth quarter, but was down around 30% from last year's record quarterly results. FICC results more than doubled from the fourth quarter led by credit products and rates and currencies. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Equity revenue was up 60% to $1.2 billion from the fourth quarter, driven by increases in all major lines of business. An improved trading environment and client activity helped the Equity Derivatives businesses while increases in both the S&amp;P and Dow had a positive impact on the Cash Equity business. Average VaR in the period increased 17% from the fourth quarter to $184 million versus a drop of 33% from a year ago.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Investment banking results in Slide 26 were relatively flat with the fourth quarter, but compared to a year ago, revenue increased 27%. Our overall fee ranking remained at number two globally. Results versus a year ago were driven by increases across all major product categories, particularly M&amp;A and equities. We were involved in numerous high-profile transactions during the quarter, several of which were outside the U.S.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Turning to expense levels on Slide 27. Total expenses, excluding the goodwill impairment charge last quarter, increased $1.4 billion from the fourth quarter. As I discussed earlier, $874 million of the increase was due to several areas of exposure, driven by the foreclosure delays. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Personal expense compared to the fourth quarter is up approximately $1.4 billion, reflecting again the impact of retirement eligible stock-based comp awards along with higher performance-based incentives in GBAM related to stronger results. Higher levels of headcount and expense in consumer real estate services were related to default management staff and other loss mitigation activities in that business. As we mentioned earlier, our litigation costs of $940 million in the quarter dropped from $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">As we told you last month at our Investor Conference, we expect our expense levels for 2011 to remain elevated as we work through these issues and continue to invest in the franchise. Highlighting what Brian said earlier, we have launched a comprehensive initiative focused on improving our financial performance by reducing expense levels and producing higher revenue. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Moving to asset quality trends on Slide 28. As they did through most of last year, delinquencies excluding government-ensured FHA loans, net charge-offs, criticized balances and nonperforming assets continued to improve. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">On Slide 29, improving credit performance in most of our portfolios drove the decrease in net charge-offs. Net charge-offs of $6 billion decreased $755 million compared to the fourth quarter. Consumer net charge-offs were down $509 million, reflecting improvement in most products. Commercial asset quality also improved as net charge-offs dropped $246 million or 26% from the prior quarter with the biggest drivers being U.S., C&amp;I, including a legal settlement recovery, and commercial real estate. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">The increase in net charge-offs in non-U.S. commercial was due to a couple large legacy credits. And even with the decline in reserve levels, the ratio of allowance for loan losses to annualize net charge-offs was essentially flat compared to the fourth quarter at roughly 1.6x.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And thinking about credit costs for the rest of 2011, we think provision expense should continue to edge down through the year as charge-offs continue to move lower, primarily in the Consumer businesses. We expect loan loss reserve reductions will continue as long as portfolio performance in the economy continue to improve and our other credit metrics warrant lower reserves.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Moving to Slide 30. Our purchase credit-impaired consumer loan book, which is comprised of discontinued real estate, residential mortgages and home equity was $28 billion, including the allowance. We increased the reserve by $1.6 billion to reflect a more negative outlook for home prices.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Turning to Slide 31. Let me add before closing that we recognize that there are a number of items in the quarter that make your analysis a bit time consuming. From our view, the positive underlying trends are improvements in credit, capital, deposits and progress on redesigning our franchise to best serve our customer base. We believe the interest rate environment will remain challenging and don't expect the mortgage picture to improve significantly for several quarters. However, as you've heard at our Investment Conference, we have articulated our strategy, and we are executing against it. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So with that, let's now open it up for questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p11\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to the side of Glenn Schorr with Nomura.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Maybe if we could just take a minute to expand a little bit, you've just mentioned and you have it on Slide 27, that the program to increase revenues and take out cost to drive profitability. And I think later on you said something about material benefits in the second half of '12 on the expense side. Can we talk maybe a little bit about the largest contributors or the largest buckets that we'll see that expense savings over the two years?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">If you think about it, think about two different things going on, Glenn. First, the largest improvement you're going to see over the next 24 months will be as we crest over the -- go over the crest on this mortgage servicing side for the delinquent assets and start to take those costs out. And likewise other places in the company, those similar costs exists. So that -- if you remember what we showed you is we showed you we had 70,000 human beings dedicated in the Mortgage business, including the contractors, 50,000 full time employees. We've gone from about 5,000 to 8,000 people who service six days in out loans to a total of 30,000 over the last several quarters, and again, 2,500, 2,600 again this quarter, 2,700 this quarter. So one of the things you'll see as we continue to get through the bubble of foreclosures, as delinquency come down, you really have a bodywork to get through. We had to stop the foreclosure. We restarted them. As we get through that, that will come down over the next several quarters. But we're talking about -- we knew we're going to get that, and so that we have identified, that's why we isolated it, and we'll get that out. What we also need to do is just to continue to -- look, we sold 19 or 20 different pieces of the company off. We have built up a lot of stuff for businesses that\u2019s no longer here. We have built processing and stuff when the company was a different company. We bought a lot of new enterprises. Our Six Sigma capabilities that we had put in because we bought in over 100,000 different associates who were new to all that. We had to step back, and take a look at every aspect of work in the company, work that doesn't benefit the customers or associates have to be taken out. That process is a process many companies use, and I've used it early in my career, but the process is in two phases. The first phase finishes late this fall; the second phase finishes early in the spring. And so we'll begin implementing as soon as we have ideas. That'll take a little longer as we go through. That is not stopping us from also doing things like in the branch team that I talked about. We are down 200 branches, down 50 this quarter. Round numbers, the cost of deposits ratio that we showed you at Investor Day dropped 260 basis points, which we think leads the industry by a lot. That includes the FDIC expense, the whole nine yards in there. So as you think about, we continue on the core assets we do on cost. The other benefits will come through a little slower as the bad assets get better and the work gets done in the program.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So I very much appreciate that, Brian. On the Mortgage Servicing side, it's a whole lot of people, and I think we get that. But in general, I think we saw through JPMorgan's results, and I'm expecting through others, in general, the cost of servicing mortgages is still going to the moon on a run rate basis. Is that thought process included in your cost savings in the second half of '12? And does that have anything to do with the MSR, where you mark the MSR?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes, in the valuations on MSR for the last couple of quarters has been a charge to increase servicing costs, which decrease your cash flow, Glenn, and that's embedded in that valuation. We're carrying 92 basis points or so, which is a conservative value, we believe, but embedded in that, in the performance in that last couple of quarters have been roughly $500 million each quarter, $450 million or so each quarter for that. And that we have to price through to the Street, for lack of a better term, because the increased amount of work you have to do to service the mortgage loan, ultimately, we have to get paid.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I appreciate that. All right. Last one on reps and warranties, I think following the partial settlement of the GSEs, I and others might have thought with $5 billion plus in reserves, we might see a leveling off on the provision. But another $1 billion with over half going to the GSEs, I'm assuming that, that's for the Fannie stuff that wasn't settled? And just curious on how you think about that as an annoying run rate that's with us for a few more quarters, or you feel like what percent of the pipe are you through now on the GSEs?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Chuck?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Charles Noski</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Sure. Glenn, there's a couple dynamics going on here. We saw a slowdown in new repurchase requests from the GSEs in the fourth quarter, as you might imagine, as they were going through the settlement process, so there's been a bit of backlog that built up by them in the fourth quarter that I think we saw hit us in the first quarter. They also seem to be devoting more time to submitting claims and less time to resolving claims, which has tended to create a bit of an elevated level at the end of the first quarter. So there's a bit of that going on. A substantial portion, though, of that, of the provision associated with the GSEs related to HPI deterioration, which was kind of funny. Most of that, I should say most of the submissions, who I've been referring to were Fannie, rather than Freddie. And in terms of where we are on the overall pipeline, we said last quarter we were in 70 to 75. I would say we're -- in terms of being all the way through with respect to GSEs, my guess is we're probably at the high end of that range now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And we'll take our next question from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">As we look at the mortgage related hits in the first quarter, are there any estimates of what the impact will be from Wednesday's regulatory enforcement actions that were announced, in terms of whether it's value in the MSR or just higher foreclosure cost?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Think about that order as being announced on Wednesday, but actually the work took place in October, November, December, the assessments and the supervisor works we've implemented, and that's why we've been adding people. So the single point of contact, the requirements on the signing of affidavits in the foreclosure process, that's been embedded in our run rate as we've been building up. And so that did impact in both the fourth quarter and the first quarter evaluation of the MSR, because we already were getting ahead of this. These are things that we identified in the work that we did in self-assessment, and the regulators identified other improvement. So the run rate aspect, that will have some elements to it, but a lot of it's in the system as we speak today.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay, so outside of potential penalties for you and all the other banks as part of this, you don't expect material costs related to enforcement actions?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">The outside significant penalties is the question. And then remember, this is the bank regulatory environment, and we will have to make an assessment as we get to the other people if we get there, what other servicing requirements we may put on. But the core of what the bank regulatory requirements do is to look back. And the other things are fairly consistent in our dialogs, but we'll see in terms of run rate cost based on that. But from a standpoint of bank regulators, the piece left open is a CMP question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And then separately, but still staying on the mortgage topic here, as we think about the sensitivity of some of these mortgage hits outside of credit to HPI declines, how much sensitivity is there, for example, as HPI is 5% worse than expected? What do you think that would mean to the mortgage put-back hits and the litigation hits and some of the other moving pieces?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Charles Noski</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yes, HPI is going to impact us in several areas. One of them being the PCI, purchase credit impaired. It will impact us in terms of reps and warranties, and then it will also impact us on the credit side with our residential mortgages at 180 days past due. It really is difficult to do it on the purchase credit impaired because as you know, it's a fair value of a life alone. And it not only requires what's going to happen to HPI this year, but also assumptions about how long a recovery takes. But if you did a shock this year of roughly 4%, over all those portfolios I just mentioned, it'd be probably about $1.5 billion. But again, it assumes on the purchase credit impaired, if you got the shock of 4% this year, with the gradual increase in home prices over several years, but again, not returning to 4% increase in home prices until well into the second half of the decade.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And then what about for some of the other buckets like the mortgage or purchases and litigation? How much sensitivity is there to those two [indiscernible]?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Charles Noski</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">That was in there as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay, okay. And then just separately, last thing, as we look at the net interest margin for the second quarter, I think the guidance in March had been, you\u2019d bottom out around 2\u00bd%. Obviously, 1Q came in a lot better than that. I'm just wondering what the outlook is on the NIM percent and the net interest income dollars for 2Q?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Charles Noski</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Matt, we think it's -- we obviously think that the second quarter will be down, not clear that we're going to go down another 17 basis points to 250. We did have, frankly, a better performance in the first quarter than we expected.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And we'll go next to the side of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">A couple of follow-ups on the Assured. I wanted to understand how much of the Assured relationship that you have has been settled at this point? I mean you mentioned first and second liens were in this discussion, but it looked to me like maybe you only settled on the 21 deals that were first liens?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Charles Noski</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Betsy, we have basically resolved virtually all of the controversies between our various companies and Assured, and that's contemplated in this settlement. Probably the only thing that is not contemplated would be those instances in which Bank of America or Countrywide or one of its affiliates might have sold a loan to another institution that then securitized that in the package of mortgages and then sold them to -- or then had them wrapped by Assured. So the way that transaction would occur, Assured would actually go to that third party and assert a potential reps and warranty claim, and then that third party, in turn, can come back to us. That aggregate exposure, in terms of mortgages, is about $1.5 billion. That was not addressed in this, nor have we really had much if anything in the way of claims asserted in that regard. But beyond that, we and Assured are basically done.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So is the -- do I interpret therefore that in your settlement, there's very little exposure or there's very little claims that you're making good on with regard to the second?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Charles Noski</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yes, with respect to the seconds, we're done. We had provided almost $1.1 billion as of the end of December relating to second-lien exposure, and we settled it basically what we had reserved for.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay, and then as we look towards the remaining claims that are outstanding, you indicated $7 billion to $10 million is still your figure. So on a total basis, if we look at 4Q plus 1Q, the exposure would be higher by about $1.6 billion. Is that right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">No, I think the way to think about that, Betsy, is that we have re-assessed what the overall exposure is to the non-GSEs. You would expect with the settlement and with additional accruals that, that $7 billion to $10 billion would go down. That's largely been offset by HPI deterioration.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay and then lastly, the Assured press release had a discussion about max loss cap dollar amount. And your dollar amount and theirs are very different. Is that because the probability of getting that max loss in your opinion is low?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Charles Noski</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">No, I think -- well, they may have a different view. I think theirs is around -- I saw an earlier draft of it, I didn't see the final one. My recollection is they're around the -- they're thinking about draws, we're looking at the underlying reps and warranty exposure.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And we'll go next to the side of Paul Miller with FBR.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets &amp; Co.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Going back to the AGO settlement, there's another big settlement out there with some other monolines. Where you are -- and they're probably larger than probably the AGO. Can you address that a little bit?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Charles Noski</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Paul, I'm not sure what you're asking?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets &amp; Co.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Well, I guess it's the MBI, isn't there another monoline suing you guys for like $20 billion or something, MBIA?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">There are -- if you think about all the monolines, there's six companies. We basically -- we settled with two. We\u2019ve worked with the other ones. MBI is the last one, and that's a very complex relationship between us because across our company, because of the developments in our sales and trading business. And it's out there, and we'll continue to work on it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Charles Noski</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And I would note, Paul, that Assured, FSA Assured was really the only one of the monolines not suing us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets &amp; Co.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And then real quick, you've mentioned, I think in the presentation or in your -- that you start your foreclosures in nonjudicial states? Where are you with the judicial states, like Florida? Have you started foreclosure processes in that state, or where do you think you can start?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">We have started foreclosure process across-the-board.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets &amp; Co.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Across-the-board?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yes, remember the difference between judicial and nonjudicial, is you've got to wait for the judicial process to take place in the judicial states. In nonjudicial states, it goes a lot quicker.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets &amp; Co.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So you're up and running across-the-board.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">We'll go next to Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Two questions. The first is, you had good reduction in the loss rate on the Credit Card business, but I think what's interesting is the industry as a whole is kind of moving faster into lower levels. Can you talk a little bit about kind of what you think the pattern is going to be there over the course of the next several quarters?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">On the credit card specifically, Moshe?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yes, credit card specifically, yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">From a high level -- I'll have the team address the specifics, but from a high level, remember that we were higher than they were and so we're coming down at a good rate. It's just that, I think we got 200 basis points, maybe even more above our peers. We got up to a 14% charge-off rate. So we have more upside as this keeps coming down. The underwriting we did starting -- changing in 2008 has outperformed in a not-as-good economic scenario three years later. And if you look at our emerging peers and stuff, we're getting strong performance in the latter part of 2008, clearly 2009, '10. So I think we have more room to go to improve frankly, largely because we had a deeper hole, frankly. And so I'll let Neil or Chuck fill in the exact reasons, but in a broad spirit, it is that we were dealing with this issue that we just had a higher number to start from.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Charles Noski</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I think Brian summed it up best, ours went bad first, and we tightened the buy box and also came down very fast. Our early stage delinquencies during the quarter continued to improve nicely, and we will see continued improvement going forward. But it will be at a slow pace, but if you look back a little bit past four, five quarters, our improvement has been dramatic.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So if you think about it in broad context, we're sort of high-7s now, and we should look that to weave under it and to hit a target of five, 5\u00bd, and frankly, with the performance, the portfolio, we\u2019ve been putting on and time phrase I talked about has actually outperformed that. So this should be a continuous move. This was $13 billion in a single quarter at one point, so we still got some room to improve, but it's come down dramatically.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Kind of on a separate issue, you talked a little bit about the capital generation and the deferred tax asset disallowance in the quarter, kind of keeping that lower than normal. But even absent that, it feels like given the level of earnings, we'd really like to see that pace pick up if you're really going to get to that 8% level in something less than two years. So could you talk a little bit about what plans you have over and above what the kind of the run rate of earnings? It seems like there would need to be somewhat more. And related to that, any thoughts you might have on the SIFI buffers that might be assessed on you?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">If you look at the balance sheet that we showed you from last year first quarter, there\u2019s three or four quarters in CDRWA [ph] coming down, but you have to remember the thing about our company, the issues that we had to face is our Basel II implementation is still in process. And we had to get this dollar work right, and that's one of the reasons why we've been pushing our expectation out of when this will all be ready to go until later this year or next year, that we need to get some work done. And part of that work is to continue to optimize the RWA calculation, the risk models and other things that will bring down RWA dramatically in our trading areas. And that requires the systems work that's been going in, and will continue to go in during the course of this year. They've been working on that. That is a major piece of the equation, and then there's a lot of other pieces of equation. If you look at all the Legacy Assets sold and the Private Equity business being brought down -- and so we just -- we're continuing to do that each quarter. So we have a road map, and it requires us to keep executing very well. And then the earnings generation, remember what's affecting the earnings is actually reductions in risk of a significant amount and then in terms of repurchased or even '03 [ph] portfolios and things like that. So you've got to think this a little bit, mostly in terms of timing. Stuff we're pulling forward and taking now would have been stuff that we would have taken over time, and so that helps us out. But it really comes down to a lot of this is around the optimization of the balance sheet. If you think about us, we run about 65% of RWA to assets today. Our U.S. peers that are on Basel II and been optimizing on the risk models and stuff are in the 50s, and our outside United States peers who have been on it for a long time are in the 30s. And so there's a lot of work for us to do, and that work is going on this year. And that's one of the bridges we have to have completed as we look to do the capital management we like to do for you as shareholders.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Just on the SIFI, any thoughts as to how and when we're going to hear about that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">One ought to be over the course of the summer here. We've obviously, by using 8% target, we\u2019ve sort of said it's going to be something. I think fundamentally, I think I'd go back to what we told you late last fall that those views you saw at our conference where I talked about this, we will store that capital on the balance sheet. So if it's 100 basis points, that's $18 billion or $1.80 a share. If it's higher than that, you can do the math, we'll store that balance as -- that capital on the balance sheet will be embedded into the book value. You can't put it to work because if you do, then you have to need more. So if it's a higher number, we\u2019ll have to store more capital, but we'll let that play out. I think in terms of the broad policy, I think we've got enough risk-based capital to run this company, and even more than we need. And I think we'll continue to work on our discussions in the broader policymakers about what the \"right answer\" is. But in fact, we've sort of accounted for 100 basis points, if it\u2019s higher than that, we'll be storing the capital, but it's all yours. That\u2019s what we've been trying to clear to you. It's not going anywhere. It's not doing anything. It's not making acquisitions. It's not being put in a business, it's all there. And the good thing is, is even if it is a higher number, what we haven't talked to you a lot about is from -- we're trying to hit that 8%. Our math gets us there at the end of next year, but -- and that's as if Basel III was fully implemented. If you think about a higher SIFI level, you have, you really have five, six, seven years to put it in. But importantly, what is not apparent to a lot of people is that the amount of optimization we actually have in the latter years is still high because there are certain structured credit trades or certain run-off portfolio still stands about half its balance after a couple of years. That will provide additional pause [ph] momentum, none of which is core to our business. And so we have a roadmap even '13, '14, '15 that there's significant RWA optimization available to us, largely, if we can be there in the sense that these are structured credit trades, they\u2019re going to run off, in other aspects it\u2019ll run off. So I think if it goes a little higher, we have other optimization. And I think in terms of the shareholder view of that, I think we'd manage into it over time, to be clear with you, how we're building towards it. But we got the risk capital to run this company.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And we'll take our next question from the side of Ed Najarian with ISI Group.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Ed Najarian - ISI Group Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Good morning. In terms of the $1.6 billion settlement with Assured, could you just walk me through how that runs through the income statement? I'm looking at Page 21, and looking at the repurchase reserve, and I guess it's not clear to me, how that's either coming out of the reserve or going to the income statement in some other way?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Charles Noski</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Sure. Well, think of this in two elements. We had provided right around $1.1 billion, $1,050,000,000 for second-lien exposure. So that was in our reserve as of the end of December. We will make a payment of approximately $1.1 billion in the second quarter and beyond in order to satisfy that. So that $1.1 billion reserve was in the $5.4 billion ending balance of the rep and warranty liability and is in the $6.2 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Ed Najarian - ISI Group Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So it's going to be netted against the $6.2 billion next quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Charles Noski</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Yes, we haven't made -- we did not make the payments as of March 31. We signed the agreement yesterday with Assured. We will begin making payments coincident with the signing of that agreement and into the future. So that's one element of it. We also entered into a reinsurance arrangement with respect to the first-lien mortgages, principally because there's very little experience associated with that. We had some modest reserves set aside for that, for a portion of that. But there's very little experience Assured has put back to us, a relatively small number of those mortgages. And so rather than pay them for something that may never happen, we thought it was more prudent to enter into a reinsurance arrangement where we've taken a view as they have with respect to the -- how those drawdowns will occur and how we might participate in those. And we estimated the cost of that reinsurance arrangement, as we've said, at about $500 million. And that was accrued in the -- as a part of our consideration of the first quarter rep and warranty liability.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Ed Najarian - ISI Group Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And then maybe Brian can put some context around this secondary question. I mean you mentioned that you feel like you're at sort of a core pretax, pre-provision run rate of about $10 billion, which as I go through your non-recurring items, we get pretty close to that number as well. And then I sort of think about looking forward, this was a reasonably good trading quarter. You're going to have some net interest margin pressure, at least in the second quarter and maybe lower net interest income. And then we at least get about a $500 million or maybe more a quarter hit from the implementation of the Durbin Amendment, although obviously that could get delayed, but at this point, I guess we'll see. But that sort of brings me down to no more than sort of an annualized run rate of about $38 billion, 9\u00bd x 4. And so it strikes me as a challenge -- and maybe you could just walk me through some of the bigger items of how you think you're going to get to a $45 billion to $50 billion pretax pre-provision run rate. Because sort of the middle of that range is about a 25% increase from $38 billion, so I'm just maybe looking at context around that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Sure. I think you've got a -- maybe behind us, make sure your time frame's right. We said that was beyond the '11 and '12 time frame out there. Think about what would happen between now and then. You'd have the mortgage cost come down, you'd have the interest rate environment change, and so we may do better next quarter. As Chuck said, we're 267 on the margin. We totally might bottom at 250, we may do better mathematically and the numbers be higher. But if rates rise, and I assume at some point the core estimates of the market -- our core estimates rates rise up to a modest set funds rate of a couple of percentage points, that is hugely beneficial to our company and ought to push us back up to 275 and higher in the margin. If you start to do the math on our size balance sheet, that's significant. So the cost structure comes down, that happens. And then on top of that, while we had a reasonably good trading quarter, that $4.5 million, that is the run rate that's on -- needs to produce on a quarterly basis. If you look at the how that we're getting that now, it is all core customer-driven business that is just coming through, coming through. Last year's elevated levels and last year's decline levels had more to do with sort of circumstances outside their control. But that's that. Then if you go to the other core businesses, remember as the economy grows, we have had no loan growth. We'll continue to run them down. The runoff portfolio, which costs us $1.8 billion, $1.9 billion this quarter, it's half that number out there. So it's really continued credit cost -- continued cost structure improvement. It's really the interest rate environment, not going crazy, but just improving the -- a little bit, which really helps the core deposit business, and then grinding on the growth of the franchise that we see on the revenue line based on the fees and other factors. And so the restructuring of consumer deposit accounts, which would be effective this year into next year, you'll see -- and as we've said, the expenses are unavoidable on the mortgage side now, but we'll get those out, then we'll work on the rest of it. So I think the business around rates, expenses and then the economy, if you've said economy was going to go on decline, that's a different question. But assume the economy gets up to more than a trend growth, the 3%, 3\u00bd% type of numbers, you'll see the general earnings of the company lift because of loans and other things.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Ed Najarian - ISI Group Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay. And then last quick one, over the last two quarters, the period end share count has gone up by approximately 50 million a quarter. Is that a share creep-up rate based on, I guess, employee comp that we should continue to think about?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Neil, won't you...</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Neil Cotty</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">It's comp. It's pretty much comp.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Ed Najarian - ISI Group Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And we should expect some kind of creep-up like that each quarter, not just in the first quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Neil Cotty</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Ed, in the average shares, if you're looking at average shares, we also had a two preferred issues that flipped and a common in the fourth quarter that pushed up the average cost.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Charles Noski</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">The mandatory converts we had.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Neil Cotty</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">So I think, Ed, what we haven't been able to do and we'll be able to do as we move down the road is the issue of being able to neutralize the comp-related stuff, which was, we get to the point where we can capital manage we\u2019ll do that as one of the first things.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And we'll go next to the side of John McDonald with Stanford Bernstein (sic) [Sanford Bernstein].</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">One more question on the Assured Guaranty. Chuck, are there reasons to believe that their success rate would be higher than claims you received from other private investors, perhaps if they have stronger rep and warranties, or anything you can point to there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Charles Noski</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">No, I don't -- it's not a contractual issue, John. It's -- just keep in mind, they're about a third of our home equity exposure. And that second-lien home equity exposure is probably some of your most riskiest stuff.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">So just higher loss content due to the mix of the home equity?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Yes. Remember, it's dominant part home equity here for this kind of party whereas you get the private label, it's all, really all firsts.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Charles Noski</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">That's right.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And then as a reminder, in terms of Basel and dividends, as a reminder for us, you said that you feel like you can get to the 8% Basel 2.5 and III. Just over what time frame was that? And is that assuming kind of no phase-in? Can you just remind us of what you're looking at for your outlook there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">What we said to you was 8% Tier 1 Basel III common at year end 2012. That's the goal under the Basel III standards with no -- and then -- and so we're there above the standards, depending on the SIFI buffer discussion that would be phased in over time. But our goal is to hit that at the end of 2012.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay. And have you said anything about where you think you'll be on that by the end of this year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">We had not said on the Basel III level, but as Basel 2.5 becomes effective, we would be above 8% under those standards at that point, I think is what we said earlier. But we have not sort of given you pro formas, and we'll continue to look at doing it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay. And Brian, is there any comment you can make regarding the dividend, the Fed process? Any specific areas where they were looking for more clarity where they wanted to see things get clearer before saying yes to your dividend increase request?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">We didn't ask them for an increase until the latter part of this year because we knew we had to get the work done I mentioned earlier around continuing to get the systems integrated, the risk management down and frankly, taking care of some of the issues like we took care of this morning, clarity there. And so we continue to make progress in that, and that leads to -- but that's really -- the core issue is us getting a lot of -- getting the work done that we promised them to do in the context of implementing the risk management standards of the company. They've been in agreement with us, our work plans all the way along. And it's their process, and how we can resubmit and stuff is up to them. But on the other hand, I tell you that we have a clear path that we know what we need to get done, and we're doing the work. And that's why we knew we had no chance and told you back in January, we're not going to ask for anything in the first part of this year because we knew we had to get this work done, and they knew we had to get this work done.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Okay. And the last thing here, could you explain again, you might have said it, that the greater disallowance of the DTA in your regulatory capital ratios, what drove that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Charles Noski</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Well when we acquired Merrill Lynch, the regulators gave us a three-year look forward period. I think last year it was two years, now it's one year. In terms of the amount of, in effect, allowable DTA that we can include in our regulatory capital calculation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">This is so you don't make the same mistake I keep making. I keep thinking we're making is, this has nothing to do with the tax position. This is purely what you can count in regulatory capital. And they went back -- during the height of crisis remember, they widened the standard because the reality of earning streams. And now we've gone back to the pre-crisis standard, but the actual tax position is a separate level.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Charles Noski</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Which is one year. We're not losing any deferred tax benefits as an enterprise. It's what you can count in the regulatory capital calculation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Okay. Carrying forward from the merger, carrying forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Yes, and this was all contemplated in all those tests and everything we had.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">So no -- you don't see risk of this happening again? It's kind of done?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Charles Noski</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">No, we're down to the one-year look forward period, which is the more traditional one.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Okay. One more -- can I ask one more quick thing here? On the expenses, Brian, do you have a longer-term target, and is that something you eventually think you'll talk about, whether a $75 billion expense base or a $70 billion or a $65 billion is kind of the right number for the company? You baked something into the Investor Day when you talked about $45 billion to $50 billion like pre-provision earnings. Is that -- as you go through this expense initiative and efficiency, you'll talk a little about what you think the right expense number is?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">I think we gave you an efficiency ratio target of getting back down to 55%. And you can see across the quarters, this efficiency ratio was bouncing all over the place right now, 58% second quarter, 100%, I think, the third quarter, 92%, 75%. But it's because of one time's in and out. Remember we're getting hits to revenue on these rep and warranties are actually revenue offsets not expense. But the goal is we can see that as that just settles and that pushes you down in the 60s and with the -- all the work we're doing over the next couple of years, we're pushed down to 55%. We expect this efficiency ratio because you got to be aware that as revenues rise, we want to deploy the expenses to continue to build this franchise. So we want to make sure we're matching the chances in our international capabilities, the chances to grow small business bankers, the chance to grow more financial advisors to serve clients. We do not want to cut back on that while we're taking the expenses out of places that need to have them taken out.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">And we'll go next to the side of Mike Mayo with CLSA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">A few clarifications. So what did HPI do over the quarter? What had you expected? And what do you expect going forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">As far as HPI going forward, we expect gradual improvement over the second half of the year, further deterioration next quarter, but not dramatic. But a gradual improvement over the balance of the year is where we're at. As far as the deterioration in the first quarter, it's on a three-month lag, but off the top of my head, I want to say, we had about 1\u00bd% for the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">I'm sorry, that's what it went down?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">That's correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">And you had expected I guess to be stable or so?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Well what you did -- I mentioned the three-month lag so we had some catch-up because of the fourth quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Okay. And then as it relates to the dividend, I'm still not crystal clear on exactly what happened. You said all along, you didn't expect the dividend increase until late this year. You go ahead and submit a capital plan with the dividend increase and the Federal Reserve comes back and says, \"You're denied.\" I guess I just don't understand the procedure aspect.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">I think the procedure aspect ought to lead to the people who designed \u2013 the Federal Reserve designed the process, but we asked them. And I think the idea of them approving something six months in advance of when we've done the work we need to do, I think that's what they basically said, keep doing the work and go on. And that's why I think it's a little bit hard to explain, but in our dialogues with them, the idea was to get the work done, and then we get the approval. If we get the work done right, and continue to approve the company's prospects during the first half of this year, the process they designed and the answer they gave us was what we disclosed. But I think the team -- my dialogues with the team and they've been with us all the way is to get the work done, and then we'll be ready to get approved. But they weren't going to approve it in advance of that work being done.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">But you can still get your dividend increase by the year end. What...</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">We don't know what the process will be for resubmission, but as soon as -- when we figure that out, we can tell you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">But would you say there's still a chance for a dividend increase by the end of the year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">We should pull back, Mike, and make sure. I said that we got to get the process down instead. But if you step back, what we\u2019ve tried to make clear to you guys is for '11 and '12, this is a modest dividend idea because we have to get to that 8% Basel III Tier 1 common level, which requires us to maintain most of the capital. And then after that, we're in a position to start returning the capital. But all the capital that we accumulate is in our changed book values on the balance sheet, and then it's going for the benefit of shareholders. We're not using it to do anything else. So I think whether we get the dividend in the second quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter, first quarter, whatever, next year, this year, I think what we're trying to be clear to you is that we need -- we're doing the work we need to do. We've been repositioning this company, improving it. And as soon as we and the regulators and the process is set, we'll let you know where we stand.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Last follow-up on that. But you will resubmit a capital plan that would at least propose the dividend increase by the end of the year? The question's whether or not it would get approved?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">The capital plan is a two-year -- look, we have all the submissions in at two years, and we'll resubmit that when the process allows you to.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">All right, then separately, as far as the peace dividend, you said several times over the call in a couple years, in a couple years. You have a new process in place to take a look at expenses. I'm just wondering if we'll see a little bit more of the efficiency pick up over the next couple of quarters. I know a lot of it's depending on credit. But aside from credit, what confidence can you give us that you have an eye on expenses quarter-after-quarter even after acknowledging the International Small Business FA investments?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Let's take a look at the headcount across the last few quarters. This quarter on a period-to-period, we're 0.3% change on 288,000 people. If you look at that, that's 700 total human beings, 2,700 adds in the home loan investment to work on that we geared up during the quarter to continue to work on that. 2000 down the rest of the company, including net of all the investments we made. So we're managing to head down in the places. Barbara, as we've talked about earlier, just announced on the production side of the mortgage company, we're down 3,500 people. 2,000 of them are contractors, we obviously would take the contractors first. So as you think about, we're managing these expenses down as we speak, but running through the expense lines of litigation expense and other things, which throw it out on a given quarter, $1 billion round numbers and some of those items this quarter. So those will come down quickly once we sort of get through some of the stuff. The headcount we're bringing down, which is the number one thing we can control and drive to. While we're making investments, we added many small business bankers, 200 FAs and things like that. In the same quarter, we're overall heads, we're flattish, and we added 2,700 people. So we're working on it every day. We're not waiting for the white smoke to rise from this process, and we continue to drive at it. The 50 branch closings in the quarter, the 2.60 on the all-in cost of all the call centers already online, total deposits and I challenge you to ask anybody in the industry if they\u2019re close to that. I was talking to somebody who told me they were at 4\u00bc, 4\u00bd. It\u2019s a thing to scale in this business, but we keep driving at that, that's down 4 basis points. If everywhere we can, we continue to work on expenses, what we're now allowing as core of the process that will help us accelerate that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">And then last question, the syndicated loans are hot recently. What were your fees from being an arranger on syndicated loans? And how much did the syndicated loans help your loans in Global Banking?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">We'll get back to you on that. I don't know. We are one of the leaders in that business, and have always been.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Charles Noski</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Given the time constraint, we will allow one more question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">And we'll take our final question from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Vivek Juneja - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">A couple of questions, just on trading. Tom Montag talks about being down 15 to 20 at the Investor Day. Can you give a little more color as to what happened in March that you've done a little bit more than that? Which categories changed? And secondly, on IB, it seems like your market share and volumes has moved up faster than fees. Can you -- it seems like a couple of big deals you got into other. Can you talk about what's going on in fees in that respect?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">As you think about it, the 15%, 20% down that Tom talked about of the $8 billion, obviously, was still in the quarter. You had to see what took place in March and there's been some stuff in and out. But on the other hand also, as we went through March, the DVA and other things, which was fairly significant, would have been taken the last month of the quarter. But overall, if you think about from the fourth quarter, the first quarter, we doubled the fixed income revenue and the equity revenue, I think, went up by 40%, 50%, 60%. So we've had a reasonable rebound. When you go to investment banking fees, I only count what people pay us, so the lead tables, having had that group for a couple of years, I talked to them about when somebody pays us, I know I've got cash, that's the interesting part of the business. And I think we did about $1.5 billion, steady with the fourth quarter last year, which had some good activity up from $1.2 billion last year, first quarter. And we continue to have a strong and robust pipeline. And if you've seen some of the offerings going out on the IPOs and things like that, and we expect us to be continuing to improve those fees. But we got $1.5 billion in fees every quarter. For the last eight or nine, we've been second based on fees received and expect that. And I guess that will continue.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Vivek Juneja - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">And on the trading side, Brian, if you just break that down a little bit by products versus rates, FX derivatives, securitized trust, can you give some color as to how you did on that year-on-year linked quarter and in terms of March, what got weaker? Which category?</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">We'll get Lee or Kevin to fill some of that in for you. But in broad stand, the place that we're -- still need to make improvement in the Commodities business. That's one of the difference between us and some of our peers and -- but on the other hand, we've done a good job in the rates and currencies and other areas. So it's really one of the big differences, just gross dollar amount between us and others is our Commodities business is just smaller and not performing so well. And so we'll \u2013 Lee can fill you in on some of the details, but overall, that's one of the big, easy identifiable differences.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Thank you, everyone, and look forward to seeing you next quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">This concludes today's conference call.

[Operator Instructions] Please note this call is being recorded [Operator Instructions]. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Stitt. Please go ahead, sir.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Kevin Stitt</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning. Before Brian Moynihan and Bruce Thompson begin their comments, let me remind you that this presentation does contain some forward-looking statements regarding both our financial condition and financial results, and that these statements involve certain risks that may cause actual results in the future to be different from our current expectations. And these factors include, among other things, changes in economic conditions, changes in interest rates, competitive pressures within the financial services industry and legislative or regulatory requirements that may affect our businesses. And for additional factors, please see our press release and SEC documents.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">And with that, let me turn it over to Brian.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you, Kevin. Now before I turn it over to Bruce, I just want to make a few comments about the quarter. As we discussed on the call on June 29, we announced the settlement on private-label securities litigation. We've been working hard to put large pieces of uncertain risks behind us as a company and where we can do that on the basis reasonable to you as our shareholders. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">This quarter, following the actions we took on last year's fourth quarter on the GSEs, in the first quarter on the monolines, we put another significant part of the rep and warrant exposure behind us and other mortgage-related matters. In all, as you can see, from the materials, we took almost $20 billion in charges related to the Mortgage business. That is translated in a $0.90 per share loss in the range we gave you a few weeks ago. Adjusting for the mortgage charges, our earnings were $0.33 a share, that's the high end of the range we gave you in June. Bruce is going to give you more details on those adjustments later on. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Switching to the important question of capital. The work we have done to improve our balance sheet over the last several quarters came through this quarter as, even with the loss, we reported capital ratios, which are stronger than this quarter in 2010. Our Tier 1 common ratio, which we -- was -- which we said at the end of June was coming around 8%, actually came in at 8.23%, higher than we expected, a drop of 20 basis points since the first quarter 2011 but improving since last year. Our tangible common equity ratio, which we estimated at the end of June to be about 5.7%, came in at 5.87%, again, an improvement of what we said.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We achieved the ratios through the continued balance sheet optimization and repair that we've been going through the company over the last several quarters. In all, during the second quarter 2011, our RWA came down over $30 billion. Bruce is going to take you through the actions we completed during the second quarter of 2011 and, more importantly, the actions that are still ahead of us in the quarters ahead, all of which gave us comfort and demonstrate we don't need to raise capital as we continue on our plans to comply with Basel III.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">As we look at the business lines and you can see how they perform, this quarter shows the power of the rest of our franchise, which has been covered up by losses in Mortgage. As you can see on Slide 5, you can see the results. Each business line, other than Mortgage, had solid earnings and returns, earning all -- in all over $5.7 billion after tax. The franchise and customer model continues to shine through. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In our Deposits business, we grew deposits. We also grew accounts at 2x the rate we grew them last quarter on net new checking accounts. We paid less for our deposits this quarter on our deposits franchise, and we lowered our cost to operate the franchise in this quarter. The transformation of this business unit continues to go well, and we are growing our fees again, offsetting the overdraft regulations that came through last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In our Card business, we had strong performance aided by the credit provision released. But we also increased our units in the United States this quarter to over 730,000 new cards. The Durbin will affect this business in subsequent quarters, and Bruce will lay that out later. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In our Global Wealth Investment Management business, we had another solid quarter. We grew long-term assets, grew our advisory team and continue to see strong performance across the franchise.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">As we move to the corporate commercial side of our house, we had strong earnings in our Global Commercial Bank as you can see. That's our Middle Market business, led by David Darnell. And we had a good quarter in our global corporate Investment Banking business, which is part of the GBAM, led by Tom -- GBAM unit led by Tom Montag. That serves our larger corporate customers around the world. The deposit and treasury management revenues in these businesses were solid. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">The loan growth outside the U.S. is strong, and our investment Banking fees of $1.6 billion plus were one of the best quarters we had in this business, since we came together several quarters ago. Our efforts here also show that our international businesses investments are starting to bear fruit as the revenues outside the United States grew faster than revenues inside the United States. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">As we switch our sales and trading portion of the GBAM, Global Banking and Markets business, we had a solid quarter, down from the first quarter of 2011 but up from the second quarter of last year. We made money on 97% of the trading days, even on a choppy market.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Let me switch to 2 other areas of focus, our credit and expenses. On credit, we continue to see improvements in all portfolios, and we still have upside as charge-offs will continue to fall. Delinquencies in all portfolios continue to come down despite the recent backup on some economic and unemployment statistics.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Our -- on expenses, we continue to manage to a flat core expense level that Bruce will show you in a few minutes, if you eliminate the large mortgage onetime charges in the expense base. We've seen our headcount go down slightly this quarter. We continue to invest where we need and have to, in this franchise. Examples are the LAS buildout, the Legacy Asset Services buildout, where we've had to invest to collect the delinquent mortgage loans, but more importantly, on the revenue side, investing in more wealth managers in our Global Wealth and Investment Management business, more FSAs or brokers in our branch and small business lenders in our Deposits business, our international franchise and importantly, a technology investor throughout the franchise.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">At the same time, we continue to take out expenses in other areas to help fund these investments. For example, this quarter, our branch count is down 63 from last quarter. Our New BAC projects, which is a company-wide initiative on expenses, will be done this quarter, in the third quarter 2011, for one -- about 1/2 of the company, and we'll give you the results of that in October and show you what we plan to do with the second half of the company during the latter part of this year. Suffice to say, that the work so far has gone well and shows a great opportunity to make our company better and more efficient in the future. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">With that, I want to turn it over to Bruce to take you through the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Great. Thanks, Brian, and good morning. If I could ask you to start with Slide 6. As Brian referenced, during the quarter, on a reported basis, we had a net loss of $8.8 billion or $0.90 a share, and if we adjust that for mortgage-related and other items, we reported net income of $3.7 billion or $0.33 a share. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We've scheduled down at the bottom of the page, the onetime items coming through the P&amp;L. The $15.5 billion of mortgage-related revenue charges is comprised of $14 billion of reps and warrants and $1.5 billion negative valuation effect on our MSR. On the mortgage-related expense items of $2.6 billion, $1.9 billion of that litigation expense and $700 million assessments and waivers. And then we've scheduled out back, on Slide 30, the asset sale gains and other amounts that are comprised of a variety of items.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Before I leave this page, I'd like to touch briefly on taxes. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 39.4%, excluding our goodwill impairment. As you look out and think of the balance of the year, think about the effective tax rate in the 30% area, excluding any unusual adjustments. The other thing I'd call your attention to here is during the third quarter, we will have an $800 million hit to our U.K. deferred tax asset, given the reduction in U.K. taxes that we would expect to be approved during the third quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to Page 7 and looking at the balance sheet. Assets during the quarter were down slightly, while we continue to see growth in the deposits. I'd ask you to spend a minute and focus on risk-weighted assets. Risk-weighted assets were down $40.7 billion for the quarter or 2.8%, which is consistent with our strategy of driving down risk-weighted assets as we look out to the new Basel capital rules. To give you a sense of the magnitude of this reduction, it led to a 23-basis-point benefit to Tier 1 common during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">As Brian alluded to, Tier 1 common at the end of the quarter was solid at 8.23%, and tangible book value ended the quarter at 12.65% (sic) [$12.65]. From an asset quality and a reserve perspective, ending loan loss reserves after the release were $37.3 billion or 4% of loans and leases in over 1.6x our annualized charge-offs that we saw for the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On Slide 8, we walk through our net interest income for the quarter. On an FTE basis, net interest income was down roughly $900 million for the quarter. Net interest margin was at 2.5%, which is consistent with our previous guidance where we expected net interest income margin to trough in the 2.5% area. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">As you think about the decline in net interest income, it was due to several factors. The first, on the consumer side, lower balances and lower yields. The second, the drop in long-term interest rates had a negative impact on our hedge results, and third, we had lower trading-related revenues.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">As you think about our strategy with net interest income and managing OCI risks, we continue to be very focused on keeping the duration in our discretionary portfolio short, as our asset liability management strategy is focused on managing interest rate risk across the company and minimizing higher -- or excuse me, minimizing OCI exposure to the extent we were to have a higher interest rate environment as we move towards Basel.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">If we flip to Slide 9 and look at the Deposits business. Net income in the Deposits business was $430 million during the quarter, up $75 million or roughly 21% from the first quarter of 2011. Average deposits were up 2% for the quarter, and net new accounts were positive for the second consecutive quarter. Brian referenced the rates paid on deposits and the cost per dollar of deposit. Rates paid on deposits came down 3 basis points from 32 basis points to 29, and cost per deposit, which we define as noninterest expense over average deposits, came down from 2.6% in the first quarter to 2.44% during the current quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On Slide 10, we walk through our Global Card business, where net income was $2 billion, a $300 million improvement or 17% over the first quarter, as credit improvements more than offset lower net interest income from lower average loans and yields. As we think about volumes, total purchase volume for debit and credit transactions was up seasonally 9% from the first quarter and 6% when we compare it back to the second quarter of 2010. Credit continued to improve significantly as delinquencies improved and U.S. charge-offs declined for the seventh consecutive quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">From an average loan and lease perspective, the $5.6 billion decline in average loans from the first quarter was due to higher payments, charge-offs and continued runoff in our noncore credit portfolio. In addition to that reduction, we exited approximately $2 billion in receivables at the end of the quarter, with virtually no income statement effect.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">There's been a lot of questions about Durbin out there. If we look at our second quarter results and we look out to the fourth quarter, which will be the quarter in which Durbin is implemented, we would expect a negative $475-million revenue impact from Durbin out in the fourth quarter relative to where we were in this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On Slide 11, we walk through the Global Wealth and Investment Management business. Net income was $506 million, down $27 million or 5% from the quarter, based on higher expenses from increases in the investment in our Financial Advisors as well as higher credit costs. Revenue for the quarter was nearly flat to record first quarter levels that we saw during the first quarter of '11 as record asset management fees, driven by market and long-term AUM loans, were offset by lower brokerage revenues reflecting lower market activity. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">During the quarter, more than 500 Financial Advisors joined the leading advisory force, pushing the total number of FAs to over 16,000 for the first time since the Merrill Lynch merger. Ending loans within the business group for the fifth consecutive quarter and were up $1.6 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to Slide 12, and looking at the Commercial Banking line of business. Net income of $1.4 billion was up $458 million from the first quarter and was at its highest level since the second quarter of 2009. Average deposits grew $6.3 billion or 4% during the quarter, as customers in this line of business continue to remain highly liquid. As we look at average loans, average loans declined $3.1 billion. On the negative, we saw commercial real estate decline by roughly $2.2 billion, which masked the improvement and the increase in average loans that we saw in commercial industrial loans in our Middle Market business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Once again, very strong improvement in asset quality within the Commercial Bank. Charge-offs declined $193 million or 38% from the first quarter. Nonperformers declined 11%, and we continued to see very solid performance in credit.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">If we move to Page 13 and look at the Global Banking and Markets business, net income for this business was $1.6 billion for the quarter and fell seasonally from -- seasonally by $576 million from the first quarter on lower sales and trading results that were partially offset during the quarter by higher Investment Banking fees. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">If we start to look at sales and trading, the revenues for the quarter were $3.8 billion dollars, a $1.1 billion decline from the first quarter, but up approximately $666 million from the second quarter. We've laid out the DVA gains that we saw during the 3 periods on this slide. And I think as you think about this business and think about the second quarter, as far as how we ran the business, its market certainty increased towards the end of the quarter, based on what's going on in Europe, global economic concerns, and quite frankly, the lack of opportunity to make money, we reduced risk at the end of the quarter. From a risk-weighted assets perspective within sales and trading, they declined $37 billion as we reduced legacy assets, exited our proprietary trading business in its entirety and continued to optimize the balance sheet as we look forward to Basel III.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">If we move to Investment Banking, Investment Banking revenues of $1.6 billion, excluding any self-led transactions, were a record since the closing of the Merrill Lynch merger, and we saw strong activity across all the Investment Banking products. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">If we move to Corporate Banking, average loans and leases increased $5.8 billion or approximately 6% from the first quarter, as we saw strong growth in our international commercial loans and trade finance, which is consistent with what we've spoken about before as we made investments internationally in 2010 and they've started to bear fruit in 2011.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">The next 3 slides, we're going to touch on are Consumer Real Estate Services. On a consolidated basis, you can see this segment reported a $14.5 billion loss. If we adjust out all of the onetime items that I talked about at the beginning of the call, net loss for the quarter was $954 million versus the $399 million that we saw during the first quarter of '11. The adjusted loss of $555-million delta occurred as the revenue was impacted by the sale of Balboa, which closed on June 1, as well as higher operating costs within the Legacy Asset Services area. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">I would also highlight during the quarter, the MSR decreased by $2.9 billion from $15.3 billion to $12.4 billion. And as we look at the cap rate on that MSR, it was at 78 basis points at the end of the second quarter versus 95 basis points at the end of the first quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On Slide 15, we look at the Home Loans business, which is the ongoing mortgage operation within our bank. You can see that net income for the quarter was $531 million. If we back out the gain on Balboa, it was $86 million, up slightly from the $77 million in the first quarter. Revenue in the quarter was helped by higher lock revenue that resulted from deliberate pricing actions that we took, as well as favorable channel mix, and was offset by lower production volumes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On Page 16 we look at the Legacy Asset Servicing business, which you'll recall is the business where we move a bucket of loans that are either significantly delinquent loans or products that we no longer are interested in participating in, you can see, once we adjust out the onetimers here, the net loss for the quarter was $1.4 billion compared to roughly $800 million during the first quarter. The 2 principal reasons for the increased loss was the result of increased costs from staffing levels within the business, as well as an increase in provision. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">As you monitor the progress in this business, this is obviously a discrete portfolio, where we're both trying to work down the number of loans in the portfolio, as well as reduce the number of delinquent loans in the portfolio. And if you look in the bottom left-hand corner, you can see we made very good progress during the quarter. Number of loans serviced was down about 3.3%, and the number of 60 days -- number of loans 60 days delinquent in the portfolio was down roughly 5%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On Page 17, we look at All Other, which is a net loss of $216 million. That's the result of elevated credit cost related to valuation refreshes on our consumer loans, as well as lower revenues. As you look at the revenue line item for the quarter, 3 types of items that affected revenue for the quarter. We had roughly a $200 million FVO adjustment on our structured notes, $831 million of gains on debt securities and about $1.1 billion of equity investment income that was comprised of the dividends from our CCB investment, the gain on the disposition of the balance of our BlackRock interest, partially offset by $500 million impairment on a strategic equity investment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">During his opening remarks, Brian touched on expenses. We've laid those out here. First, I'd like to say a couple of things. If we exclude these selected items, which we detailed elsewhere in this presentation, the reported $22.9 billion of expenses was $17.7 billion in line with the first quarter and relatively flat with the fourth quarter. Expenses related to increased servicing cost in our Mortgage business, as well as the additional client-facing professionals that we've talked about in this presentation, were offset by reduced personnel in various other areas of the company.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We referenced New BAC. In May, we initiated New BAC, which is an intensive effort on our part to create greater efficiency throughout the organization. We're currently identifying ideas and action plans, and we intend to begin implementing those as we get closer to the end of the year. While I know you want us to identify some potential benefits to the bottom line, all I can say at this time is we're very focused on expenses, and we'll update you on the progress as we meet certain milestones.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">The next couple of slides, I'm going to talk briefly about credit trends, which continued to be quite strong. On Slide 19, we look at consumer credit trends. You can see net charge-offs, delinquencies and nonperformers continue to improve, and the total provision expense for the quarter for our consumer loan portfolios was $3.8 billion, which is comprised of $5.2 billion of charge-offs and a reserve reduction of $1.4 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On Slide 20, we look at mortgage and home equity delinquencies. What I would highlight here, as you can see, delinquencies peaked in the second quarter of 2009, and we've seen 5 quarters of continued reductions in those delinquencies through the second quarter of 2011.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On Slide 21, we look at nonperforming assets within our residential Mortgage and Home Equity books. You can see that during the second quarter of 2011, both less than 180 day, as well as greater than 180-day delinquencies, improved in both residential mortgage and home equity. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">With that being said, I'd make 2 additional points. The first charge-offs do remain elevated due to refreshed valuation losses, even though the frequency of loss continues to improve. The second thing I would note is that we've started to see the greater than 180-day backlog decline as foreclosure activity has started, particularly in most nonjudicial states.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On Slide 22, we talked about home price impact on the call on June 29. We said we'd give you some greater color on that, and what we've laid out here are those portfolios that are most subject to immediate changes in home prices. As you think about home prices in our assumptions, once again, we look at macro markets. Currently, our assumptions are very much in line with those. We expect a little bit north of a 3% decline in home prices in 2011 and a 1% increase in 2012, largely during the second half. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">As you think about the individual portfolios that are affected by home prices, we have roughly $40 billion of portfolios that are directly affected, $13 billion of nonperforming loans that are more than 180 days past due that have been written down to net realizable value. Given they're at net realizable value, every 1% decline in home prices will have a correspondingly immediate effect on this portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Within purchase credit impaired, which is carried at $0.66, we have $27 billion of carrying value. That portfolio, on average, is about 40% delinquent. So as you think about a 1% decline in home prices, it will be immediately affected but not to the entire magnitude of the decline in home prices.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Outside of that which is on our balance sheet, we're affected by home prices in the GSEs. If you think about how we're affected by the GSEs, to the extent home prices go down, it affects the collateral losses which they bear. We obviously share those collateral losses to the extent that we have defects. We currently estimate that about every 1% change in home prices is $125 million relative to the GSEs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We've not touched on or talked to how changes in home prices can affect our core portfolio, that obviously is something that happens over a period of time, and we provide reserves over and above what our model reserves are, to try to reflect those types of risks that are out there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On 23, we look at commercial credit trends. Charge-offs declined $180 million in the second quarter of '11, relative to the first quarter. Total provision was a benefit of $523 million and reflected a reserve reduction of $1 billion in the quarter. I would also note, you can see that both nonperformers and reservable credit size declined 11% during the quarter, as corporate credit continued to improve.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Let's now shift from credit to capital. On 24, we've laid out our Basel I Tier 1 common, which Brian alluded to at 8.23%. And as I mentioned earlier, 23 basis points of benefit based on the improvement in risk-weighted assets under Basel I. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">On Page 25, which we showed tangible common, which remains very strong at just under 6%, and tangible book value at $12.65 at the end of the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">As we look out at Basel III, we've laid out on Slide 26 the phase-in schedule. What I would say here is we continue to very actively mitigate both the numerator and the denominator effects. As we approach Basel III, we will be well above all of the minimums that are required under Basel, and once again, as we told you at the end of June, we have a goal of 6.75% to 7% of Tier 1 common, as we enter into 2013.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">On Slide 27. As we think about Basel mitigation, we show you the different things that we've completed since we became very focused on this at the beginning of 2010. If you look at the bottom left, we talked about the things that we've accomplished during the first half of '11. Risk-weighted assets under Basel I, down by over $60 billion due, in part, to reducing our legacy capital markets, risk exposures. Our MSR, as I referenced, is down $2.5 billion, and we completed asset sale gains, generating $1.3 billion of Tier 1 common gains and reducing risk-weighted assets by $5 billion during the first half of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">As we look out at the activities that we're focused on to meet the guidance that we've given at year-end 2012, on the numerator side, under Basel III, we see additional mitigation of $200 billion to $250 billion that will enable us to get to our targeted Basel III risk-weighted assets of $1.8 trillion. The way that we'll get there is to continue to reduce our capital-intensive assets, rebalance our portfolios and optimize our models to be able to get to where we need to for Basel III. We'll also continue to very aggressively, as I talked about in interest rate, to manage the OCI risk associated with our interest -- our net interest income.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">The last point here, future mitigation efforts. We've obviously heard the question that's out there: Your 6.75% to 7% at the end '12, where do you go beyond that? As you look to get to the fully phased-in number of 9.5% by the end of '19, even with all of the actions that we've talked about, we have significant additional actions we can take in '13 and beyond. We've laid out 3 portfolios of assets here that we would expect to reduce aggressively. We have a loan run-off portfolio of $70 billion, that we would expect at the end of '12, that runs off by roughly 20% a year. We have a structured credit trading book, that's roughly $30 billion at the end of '12, that will run off over a 5-year period as well. And we have a private equity portfolio that's roughly $50 billion under Basel III, that will be out there at the end of '12, that we'd expect to run off over the several years beyond 2012. In addition to that, you can expect to see us continue to reduce assets in the way that we've done over the course of the last 6 quarters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">If we move now from the denominator to the numerator, 2 things I want to touch on here. The first is the MSR. We referenced that the MSR is $12.5 billion at the end of the second quarter. You can expect to see us taking 2 types of actions with respect to the MSR, going forward, that will benefit the numbers beyond the 6.75% to 7% range I quoted. The first is we're taking a very close look at the types of activities we're originating in servicing. So on the front end, you'll see actions where we look to scale back, that which we put on our books to service. Secondly, we're very focused on looking out and moving MSR assets through sale, in those instances where it makes sense. We had roughly $70 million of gains on MSR sales during the second quarter of this year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">The last thing I want to highlight on the numerator is the deferred tax asset and the multiplier effect with respect to that. As I think everyone knows, the deferred tax asset flows through the Basel calculations in several different ways, depending on whether or not it's an NOL DTA or a timing DTA. As you think about the leverage though and the benefits that we will have from the reductions in DTA through 2012 and significantly but -- beyond, at the end of June, we'll have roughly $30 billion of a net deferred tax asset, roughly 2/3 of that is associated with NOLs and 1/3 is associated with timing. The net effect of that is that we would expect our Tier 1 common to grow at a rate that's above that, which is improved just by the generation of net income.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">As we look to wrap up and close, we continue to work very diligently in getting the legacy assets -- or excuse me, the legacy issues, as well as the legacy assets, behind us while we reposition our business for future growth. If you think about the earnings this quarter, they demonstrated that our businesses outside of mortgage are producing attractive returns, even with the headwinds of low interest rates. Deposits continue to grow as we make progress on our customer-focused relationship strategy. Credit quality continues to improve. We have solid capital ratios. Our liquidity position is very strong, and we expect to grow capital going forward. We look at the opportunity each day to make progress, and that's what we are all about. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And with that, let me open it up to questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p8\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Glenn Schorr with Nomura.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Quickie. I think it's good to see the $200 billion-$250 billion risk-weighted asset reduction expectations. Just curious what you think the revenue or earnings associated with that are?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I think if you look at and you saw the individual books, one of the most significant contributors to that reduction of $200 billion to $250 billion is actually something, over the last several quarters, that we've taken losses on. I think if you think about the structured credit trading book, that's not something where you see significant amounts of income on as well. So think -- the net of it is, while there is some income, there are also certain elements of that, that have been expensive. So we really don't see any material level of impact into the income statement from reducing that $200 billion to $250 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Not bad. I noticed on one of your first slides that long-term debt was down a bunch. That's in line with I think your previous. So I was just curious on what your refinancing schedule thought process is for the next, say, 6, 12 months. What do you need to fund? What don't you?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Sure. The -- I think as you look out, we obviously put out a 22 months to funding. I think it's important, even though the mortgage settlement is uncertain, that 22 months to funding reflects the payment of the $8.5 billion associated with the mortgage settlement. We don't know exactly when that happens, but we've assumed it will be within the funding window. What you haven't seen here is we -- in addition to taking down debt, we continued to aggressively reduce our short-term debt with the goal of driving our commercial paper balances to 0. And the last comment I would make there is that the reason the balances continue to remain as high as they are is we're pursuing liquidity to be able to pay off the balance of our TLGP debt at the end of June. And as you think about issuances, I would say that we'll continue to be opportunistic as it relates to getting the debt markets, and at the same time, we're being very aggressive in looking to generate liquidity through selling parent company assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And we'll take our next question from John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Bruce, how much did the long rates hit the hedge component in 1Q? How much -- in the second quarter, how much did the hedging component hurt NII and NIM? you mentioned that was a factor.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">It was about $300 million, John.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. So -- and you did use the term trough for the NIM and I guess NII, too. Could you give us your outlook in the near term about where you see the NIM and NII heading?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Sure. I think we would clearly expect -- and let me start with the net interest income. We would clearly expect net interest income, if not at the trough, to clearly be pretty close to that. On the NIM, there are 2 comments that I'd make. The first is the rates that we're seeing with respect to the corporate loans that we've made have not shown any material deterioration, so the yields that we're seeing on the asset side continue to hold up. What I do want to caution you to a little bit is, to the extent that we continue to generate the types of liquidity on the deposit side that we are, NIM will be affected to the extent that, that happens because we're not going to chase long-duration assets that have OCI risk, and we're not going to chase assets that we don't feel comfortable with the credit. So realize that, that margin may jump around a little bit, depending on exactly how strong our deposit growth is.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And, John, that -- we've been consistent for several quarters, and we actually, the last couple of quarters, did better than we thought on our reported basis in the net interest income line. But we still stay consistent where we've been at the -- at troughs in the second quarter, third quarter this year, and then it ought to come out from there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">That's the net interest income, Brian, you said, troughs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yes. The dollars that Bruce talked about.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And in NIM, Bruce, your answer there, to summarize on, the NIM percentage could bounce around either way, give or take, depending on what happens in liquidity?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I think that's fair. And once again, it's going to be a function of liquidity versus the assets that are available, but we're going to be very sensitive to both OCI risk and credit risk with respect to that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. So then on Basel III and, Brian, a question about the capital raise. You've consistently stated you don't need to raise capital. Could you again just kind of walk through your reasoning on that? Is that because you've gotten a sense from regulators that a Basel III fast forward is not going to happen and that you'll be allowed to meet the requirements as they're actually phased in?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Right. I think that the sense we get from the world regulatory community is that they've phased in, with the phase in, and put in purposely when it will be put and install. But importantly, I think -- what I think, John, we got a lot of people focused on was from here to 2012. And what I think Bruce was trying to add earlier is beyond '12, there's significant mitigation, both on the numerator and denominator side. So a lot of discussion about how you get from the 7% level to the 9.5% over that course of the 5, 6 years, people -- the pace at which you move in the first couple of years of that is high, because the amount of numerator improve when you get to the DTAs and other things. So what we try to do to today is to show you that. But I think -- we believe that we can get to the 7 -- 6\u00bd -- 6.75% to 7%, we said, by year-end '12, continue to improve well beyond that. And that takes into account us continuing to make the great improvements and the optimization on both the RWA side and numerator. And so I -- everything we hear is that's consistent with where we need to go. The sheer amount of capital we have, if you just step back and think about it, and compare to where we were 12 months ago or 24 months ago is quite high, including both on the ratio side and raw dollars. So we continue to make improvements. It make us feel comfortable. And we got to continue to show you that bridge each quarter as we execute.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So there's no pressure to raise capital from regulatory side of things?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">No.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. And then, Bruce, on the January 1, 2013, 7% goal. That's assuming you're hitting yourself on the numerator deductions there, right? If you didn't have the numerator deductions, because those don't start till 2014, do you have a sense of what your Basel III actual number would be as reported and required on January 1, 2013?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I would think about that number, John, as being well above 8%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Right. And that's what you'd actually be reporting when it starts, right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">That's correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Right. There'd be no numerator deductions. The way to think about it is that, each year, as the numerator's deductions are coming in over the pace beginning in '14 and beyond, we'll make numerator improvement before that. And so that's a fully front loaded as if it were 1/1/'19 number, this 6.75% and 7.5%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So why you're showing us this lower one of 6.75% to 7%, just because the market is asking for it, or regulators haven't asked you to fast forward that, you're just doing it to show a more conservative number?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I think we all basically said if we show you that number, that shows you there's -- you don't have to wait for it to come in. And I think that's the -- the goal there is our peers have all been showing it to you, we've been showing it to you, so we'll continue to show that. But I think as we move through each period, the reported number will be much higher than that, and that's what you pointed out. So it's not a question of capital adequacy under any standard that we measure, because remember the standard at the end of '12 is 3.5%. So if you think about that in our context, you have $100 billion of capital more than the minimum. So it's not a question of capital adequacy. We're doing it to show you what the fully phased-in number is, so you could compare it against other people.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And we'll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Follow-up question on capital. So risk-weighted assets came down under Basel I by about $40 billion in the quarter. What was the effective Basel III RWA decline?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We don't have an exact number on that Betsy. What I would say is that in almost all cases, the Basel III number is going to be higher than the Basel I number but we don't have that exact number.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. Because it just looks like your $200 billion to $250 billion RWAs under Basel III, on a quarterly basis, runs -- comes out at roughly the same amount so.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes. There are some fundamental steps to that, Betsy, in terms of the -- think it's going from 1% to 2.5% to 3% in the optimization around model developments and way that works on the trading books. So it will not be as ratable as you may be by dividing it out, but it -- but the math works. It'll come in bigger chunks, I think, frankly over the next couple, 3 quarters as we get these models fully implemented and optimized.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. So it's back-end loaded, not front-end loaded.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">No, it's more front-end loaded .It'll come a little quicker in the latter part of this year and early part of next year as the models get implemented, and then it'll slow down, just look around at what we're doing on the asset side.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And then in the first half of '11, obviously you had some asset sales and then you've got your 6.75% to 7% goal by the end of 2012, but I don't see any assets sales in this bucket that you've identified. So you then -- you've got future mitigation goals where you've got continued asset sales. So you're just suggesting that if you did assets sales between now and 2012, recognize some gains, that would ain't be incremental to the 6.75% to 7%?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">That's correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. Because you obviously have the opportunity to make some asset sales in the next quarter. I mean, people have been -- and then you're not going to comment on what you're planning on doing. But if you were to sell anything you would -- obviously, that would be incremental. Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">If we sell assets, it'd be incremental.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. And then can you just give us this -- I know you can't talk specifically about the mortgage foreclosure settlement, but maybe you can give us a sense as to where you think it is relative to a final conclusion. Are we likely to get a settlement here in the next quarter or so, or is it still touch and go and who knows?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">What I would say there, Betsy, is that, I think, as you all read about, this is something that's very fluid and continues to move around. What I would say is that I think everyone realizes it would be a good thing to get this wrapped up, so that people can move forward. There are obviously a lot of people that are involved with this that need to get to the same place. What I would say from a financial impact perspective, as we look out at and as we understand what's out there with -- kind of ask you to think about 1 or 2 things. The first is that during the second quarter, as we mentioned at the end of June, we did provide some litigations, litigation reserves, during the second quarter to be able to help address any cash-type penalties that would come out of that. And beyond that, we believe that we've got reserves that we can direct towards some of the settlements, and we just won't really know the exact amount of that until this is finalized and we see if everyone can get to a common place.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Is there an opportunity for potentially you to settle outside of the whole industry?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I'm sorry?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Is there any opportunity for you to settle outside of the whole industry?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I wouldn't comment on litigation strategy at this point, Betsy. But I think Bruce gave you a sense of what we're trying to accomplish over there [ph].</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. And then lastly on the settlement that you did announce with the consortium. Clearly, the market's seeing some dissents coming in. Did you expect them? How do you plan to deal with that? And then lastly, did you get an IRS opinion on the settlement before you announced it, i.e is it going to be -- do you expect it will be deemed to be handled within the REMIC structure of the trust?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. If you look at the agreement, we did not get an IRS opinion before the deal was announced. The deal is obviously subject to that, and we have no reason to believe that we wouldn't get that opinion. As it relates to the reaction from holders, I think when we were on the call on the 29th -- this is obviously a unique structure. The types of challenges and the like that we've seen with -- that are out there were clearly expected by both the Gibbs &amp; Bruns group, as well as ourselves. And the other thing that you've probably seen out there is the work that was done and released that the -- from the trustee and all of the experts that opined and spoke to the work that they've done. So I think -- the only thing that we'd say is that we obviously did a lot of work and had a lot of smart people around it. The investor group did the same, as did the trustee. There's a court date that's been set out there for November, and we'll continue to see how it progresses forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And we'll go next to the side of Paul Miller with FBR.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets &amp; Co.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Hey, Brian, going back to the first question on the revenue impact of shrinking the risk-weighted assets. On a separate Investor Day, you talked about a normalized number but you couldn't give us -- you couldn't tell us when we're going to get there, and that normalized number is roughly in that $200 billion to $250 billion range. Do you have any update to that normalized number guidance, or are you just don't really feel that it's a -- that this lower risk-weighted assets will have a meaningful impact on those numbers neither?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">When we gave you those numbers, we had in it the mitigation, that Bruce described earlier on the risk-weighted assets. As far as an update, if you think about -- let's just use in the PPNR guidance that we gave you, if you look at what we did this quarter, at the time we told you out in more normalized environment, we'd be $45 billion to $50 billion, $30 billion from the core businesses and 15 from card, this quarter, we did about $14 billion plus from card, which leaves we needed to do obviously around $30 billion, $31 billion from the rest. We did about $20-odd billion from the rest of the businesses, leaves us about $8 billion short. If you think about how we make that up, there's really 2 major components. One is as we said at that day and, Paul, you're well familiar with, as rates rise, the benefits of the deposit franchise become a lot more lucrative, and then net interest margin will expand back out. That ought to be worth $3 billion, sort of annually. And then on the cost side, in the PPNR number that of $8.5 billion -- $8.7 billion this quarter is still the operating costs for all the mortgage legacy assets, which -- and also the elevated costs we're working on our New BAC project. The operating cost, as you saw on one of the slides Bruce has, is about $1.7 billion, $1.8 billion for Legacy Assets Servicing just this quarter. That will drop $1 billion plus a quarter easily, and then the rest of the cost will come through. So I think we could -- we'll still see that when you put that together, sort of $14 billion-ish, $14.5 billion on card, plus the need to get the $30 billion on the rest of it, to get to the level we talked about. But if you look at the shortfall, there's really 2 major components, getting it to work on the cost side and the net interest margin expansion when rates rise. And you put all it against that, then we're obviously projecting more normalize time at little better economy than the growth rates we're seeing now in the GDP. So we still feel comfortable with that guidance, and we still are working towards that and making all the preparations. The RWA optimization was factored into our thinking there, and the reality of that RWA optimization is it's along a bunch of assets that are not core to what we do as a company. And it's something like the structured credit trading book is not a business that we continue to do in a way that was done at the -- in the '07, '08 timeframe but takes till '13, '14, '15 for it to run off. So as you think about that, I think we're comfortable that -- we are comfortable with the projections that we gave then, and I just try to give you a little insights on the PPNR, for example, the $45 billion to $50 billion, how do we get back in that range.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">We'll go next to the side of Matthew O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Question on expenses. You just gave us a little commentary in terms of what might be coming down and the magnitude, but obviously the cost savings opportunity seems quite large. There has been some talk about reducing the branches by about 10%. At the end of this year, when you're done with your internal work, are you going to present to the Street kind of total cost-savings program in terms of dollars and more backup detail?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Well, yes. In the third quarter call, because we'll finish the work during the third quarter, we will have the work that's really on -- think of all the consumer businesses and all the centralized groups that we've done. And then in the third quarter, we start with the G1 Global Commercial Banking business and good GBAM business, and we split in half just because of the size of our company and the amount of work. So we will give you that in the third quarter. And we're deep into it now. We've been seeing all the ideas. We've had the steering committee meetings and going through it, and we're very confident, as I said earlier, that it'll provide great benefits to the company.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And then as you go through initiatives, such as this, the size of the opportunity, what type of macro backdrop do you try and keep in mind? I mean, obviously, there's a lot of moving pieces on the capital markets, on the rate environment. Do you have kind of a base case that you try and manage for and then provide some flexibility up and down?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yes. We obviously do. If you think about how we manage the money -- the company across the last several quarters, the environment we've managed into is to try to figure out how to keep the -- leave aside the quarterly expense or my company assessments or things which are more volatile that are hard to predict. But the core operating expenses, core headcount, we've been managing it to try to make sure as we deployed assets in places we wanted and we were taking them out of other areas to fund it, and so we've been running at about that level. I'd say that longer term, I hope your expectation -- our expectation is the economy will grow faster but the backdrop of this is a -- an economy growth moving towards trend over the next couple of years, not at trend tomorrow. So it's a modest growth environment that the economy keeps grinding along and grinding along and -- but doesn't improve dramatically in the short term, but improves over time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay, and then separately I think you've addressed most of the capital questions out there. But just to clarify, the targeted capital ratio at the end of next year, that would not include any potential gains from CCB. But what about additional private label losses of up to $5 billion? You've talked about the state attorney general settlement. Have you factored any of the mortgage hits as well?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">We -- the -- well, the question that Betsy had is what you have in asset sales and things like that. So I think in embedded in there are our estimates for ongoing costs of litigation and things, like normal run rate cost of what our earnings would be over the next quarter. So it's all in there, and when we factor that all, then we get to 6.75% to 7%. And I'd be careful about trying to pluck any piece out and say this piece is in, this piece is in, but it's -- we factored it all in, in terms of our expectations of when litigation costs will come or when asset sales, that Betsy talked about, will take place, if any, and how it'll affect it. So it's in our estimates, and we'll tell you that -- we'll give you a quarterly report on how we're improving them and the progress we're making.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. So just to be clear, that's an all-in number, including both potential ongoing mortgage costs, as well as opportunities to take gains.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">In the -- in earnings of franchise and things like that. And then what we're trying to be clear with you is from '12 out -- and I think because we had such focus on now through '12 because at the time - we spent a lot of time on this early this year was before the SIFI buffer, et cetera. So SIFI city buffer came in, but we want to make sure that you're seeing is the opportunities from '13, '14 and out, through numerator optimization and denominator work, that will help drive us to the next level. So from now to '12, it's -- it factors in all of the things you just -- we just talked about.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">We'll take our next question from Mike Mayo with CLSA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Just staying on the capital issue. I guess the other potential events that could cause a capital raise would relate to funding or rating agencies or CDS spreads. What are you seeing from those areas? I mean, I guess CDS spreads are a fraction of where they were at the crisis peak but they're up from the low. If rating agencies threaten a downgrade, might you have to raise capital? And what I'm really getting to and you talked a lot about it already, Brian, is just what's your level of conviction that you don't need to raise capital?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I'll start. The level of conviction is, given the economic scenarios, which are moving along but at a very slow, steady -- slow pace, is that we don't see it. From a funding perspective, I think if you look, Bruce mentioned earlier and I'll let him touch on it, that we have driven down short-term funds to a very small amount. Our plan is to take it really down next to 0. We've built up tremendous liquidity. We've -- the ratings of the banks and the broker-dealer are separate. We can continue to operate the business as if between all the things going on around the world, that you could see disruptions in the markets, and we continue to watch that carefully. So, Bruce, you want to?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yes, and I would just add, Mike. I mean, a couple of things. We obviously continue to work with the rating agencies very closely. I think if you look out at S&amp;P, you can see that we had them take a look at the broker-dealer, both Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, as well as MLI, and they actually notched the broker-dealer up. So we felt good about that rating. And the other thing I'd say as it relates to access to capital, we obviously put the news of the settlement and released the guidance at the end of June, and we went out and raised $2.5 billion in the fixed-income markets at the beginning of July at attractive rates. So we're very sensitive with the rating agencies. We continue to work with them closely, and we continue to be opportunistic as it relates to accessing the markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">What about your exposure to the countries in Europe, the PIIGS countries? What's your net exposure? What's your gross exposure?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yes. If you look out at -- in the supplement, we put some information out there. And you can see that the number that we have out there is $16.7 billion. As you think about that $16.7 billion realized, it's been reduced by roughly $1.1 billion due to hedges. Outside of that $16.7 billion that was reduced by $1.1 billion of hedges, we have additional protection that's not factored into that number, roughly $1.3 billion -- or excuse me, $1.7 billion of CVAs hedges and an additional $3 billion of single-named hedges that we've not reduced those numbers by. So we were active and early in getting after this exposure, starting in the first quarter of 2010. We've laid out the exposure with the caveats that I've just mentioned. And while we're very focused and vigilant in watching it and trying to think through what the spillover effects could be, as we sit here today, we feel very good about where the exposure is.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I mean, how much could you lose if things go worse in Europe, which could, in turn, potentially lead to a capital raise? I'm asking you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yes. I think what you have to think through as you think through the exposure, there's 3 different kinds of buckets of exposure that we have within the region. The first is the corporate loan book. And what I would say is that if you look at the corporate loan book, it is largely to large, multinational global-leading companies and to the extent that the amounts are above house guidelines, in many cases, like I said, we buy protection. So the corporate loan book, we feel very good about. If you look at the liquid-traded book, we only have one country where we have any meaningful level of sovereign exposure, and we have protection that largely offsets that. And then we have a securities book that's mark-to-market that we mark every day. So as we look at any meaningful level of losses from where we sit today, we just don't see it, and clearly, we don't see it wherever it lead to there being any kind of capital event.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And then last follow-up for Brian again. Brian, I think what -- I heard you just say, we don't see it in this economic scenario. And if you can provide any more confidence, because at the start of the year, where -- are you considering the possibility of a dividend increase by the end of the year? And now, several investors have asked about the idea of a potential capital raise. We've kind of gone full circle here. So just your level of conviction? Can you provide any more comfort -- do you have more confidential information than any of us to have on the call?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Well, we've given you the improvements we've made in the capital. And even with the sizable $20 billion charge this quarter, that impacted 20 basis points. So our economic scenario is posted -- is out there. The scenario that we used to plan against this is the one you see out in the domain, which is modest growth, and we don't see anything in that. The challenges we have reserved -- the difference between now and a couple of years ago when people worried about deterioration in the economy, when employment obviously rose and think about the reserve levels we have, think about the improvements in the portfolios that we have made across that. So when -- there's lot of discussion about future home risk, there-- risk the charge-offs in -- our mortgage portfolios combined between home equity and first residential. $2.5 billion off that quarter is still an unacceptable level. But they're down from the peak even while housing prices actually have deteriorated from the time they peak, because the quality of the portfolios and the quality of borrowers in the portfolios is different than it was. So that gives us good step between reserves, the capital we built in the quality portfolios to hold us against economic times, which are going to bounce around, and that's what we've done. So you see this quarter, with a charge of $20 billion, we took a 20 basis point hit to ratios and plowed through it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And we'll go next to the side of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Maybe -- I don't know if you could flesh out the answer a little more, as to how you are confident that this quarter or the third quarter, the trough in net interest income, and what things would kind of lead you to think that, that number turns around and starts to grow?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">A couple of things. As I'd say -- if you think about the quarter and what we absorbed, it was obviously a fairly significant negative effect on hedge income, and we clearly would not expect that to happen again, given how flat the yield curve is as we look out there. The second thing that I would say is that we had some runoffs in the corporate book during the second quarter that we wouldn't expect to see again. So I think as we look at the number, absent some meaningful change in the rate environment, when we look at both the assets that we have, as well as the rates that are applied against them, I think that the -- we feel pretty good that we're pretty close to the trough as it relates to net interest income.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And, Bruce, in that $300 million that you identified in the hedging, does that come back, or is that the absence of a negative in the future?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I don't want to speculate if it comes back or it doesn't, but I think you know during the first quarter, we had some benefits from hedging. So the number bounces around, but I just want to reiterate that the reason it's there is because we're very sensitive to OCI risk and making sure that as we go out towards Basel III, that we don't have any negative effects from OCI.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">But I think if you think about it more broadly, the -- what's been going on in the last many quarters that we've been trying to make sure people saw is that as you\u2019ve ran off some high-yielding assets, which don't have a net profit contribution because the charge-off exceeded yield and that keeps running down, that was hurting us. And then what we -- and the offsets that were grinding down your debt cost and your deposit cost. The issue now is that the core loan growth is still -- is modest and even backing out the runoff portfolios, just because the economic activity is not that strong. So that is -- that helps and that we're seeing that activity be a little stronger than it was several quarters ago, but it's bumping along the deposits. So we continue to drive down deposit costs and OEM costs of debt by paying off the term debt, as someone mentioned earlier. So we'll be grinding at this. So the assumption is as we trough out here, it'll continue for a while. It's not going to leap right back up. So we want to make sure that you guys see it, but it's in line with what we've been predicting for 6 quarters, that this would be the place where we'd sort of see it bottom out. But long term, it'll -- we'll have to grind from here, on both the liability pricing side, the debt cost side and also, you grind out loan growth slowly but surely.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Yes. And a separate but somewhat related issue. As you mentioned, $475 million a quarter of impact from Durbin. Obviously, that's less than you thought before potentially. But can you talk a little bit about your strategies to mitigate that from both from a product and pricing standpoint?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Sure. I think -- usually, Durbin gets caught with all the other changes that have gone on, as opposed to any of them going back, what seems like a long time ago, to CARD Act and then Reg E and Durbin and all the pieces. So we're on the consumer business. So how do -- how are we mitigating the activity. If you look what we've been doing as the new account structure has now been rolled out in 3 states for new accounts and then now for all accounts and they're converting the account, that is all going very well. So we'd expect that conversion to take place during 2012. And what that does is institute some monthly fees and other ways customers can pay us, away from overdrafts or, frankly, devalue the interchange in Durbin. And so the pricing structure that is set, will be set -- is set and will be set to generate the activity. The good news is that -- reasonably good news is that where we ended up in Durbin is a place where we continue to drive debit usage. And as you can see from the statistics on the -- on the Card page, you can see the payments made through plastic, and our franchise continue to grow 5%, 6% a year. You take out the gas prices, it's 4% to 5% a year. Gas price contribute 1.5% to 2% of that. So we will continue to drive the usage of that, which continue to drive the revenue up from a level after the Durbin takes it away. So it's the account structure. It's the pricing within that monthly accounts. It's the charges that you've seen some of us put in across the last several months to make up for some of the fee loss. But the real benefits that come -- really as we convert the entire account base to new structure in '12 and into '13, and the benefits come in '13 after you're done with the conversions. And think about this, this is all 30 million checking holders going through a conversion or franchise, so it's a large conversion and will take place after we finished migrating the deposit platforms together. So it's going well. It's having intended outcome, both from a dollars and cents basis but also from a customer behaviors basis, and we'll continue to drive that. That all being said, the other way that we'll get paid is to have to maintain discipline deposit pricing, as short-term rates rise at some -- as the economy improves and that will be credit for us to do. You've seen our ability to continue to take down deposit pricing and grow deposits and the competitor for customer's deposit money won't be competitive until short-term rates rise quite a bit. And so if we maintain a deposit price, another way to make up for that cost.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And we'll go next to Ed Najarian with ISI Group.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Ed Najarian - ISI Group Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Most of my questions were answered, but I have one specific question for Bruce. It's a bit detailed. And if you look on Page 10 of the supplement, which is the liability side of the average balance sheet, I'm focused in on your cost of federal funds purchased, securities loaned or sold under agreements of repurchase. That cost this quarter was 159 basis points, up from 129 basis points last quarter and 79 basis points a year ago, and I'm comparing that to other banks. I just compared that to J.P. Morgan, for example. A year ago, you actually borrowed on that line for 5 basis points less than J.P. Morgan did at 79 basis points versus their 84 basis points. A quarter ago, you borrowed for 20 basis points more at 129 versus their 109. Now you're borrowing for 49 basis points more. Is there something going on in terms of your ability to borrow in the wholesale markets and that cost rising more rapidly than peers? Or why, in your opinion, has this line item, which is pretty substantial at $338 billion, grown, from a borrowing cost perspective, so much more rapidly than peers?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yes, I think we can get back to you with the exact numbers. I believe, Ed, that there's a couple of things going on within the numbers. The first is that some of the hedges are directed towards that. So as we talked about some of the hedge income and the ineffectiveness, you'll see some of that there. The second thing is we looked out at and we've talked about we're extending within some of our repo books, extending the maturities on those repo books as we go forward. And the third thing is, and we can get you the exact number, is that during the second quarter, within the Markets business, is we borrow in Europe for dividend stocks. Given that the dividends in Europe are paid in the second quarter, the borrowing cost typically blips up a little bit in the second quarter for that. So we can get you the exact numbers, but I think those are the 3 things that would contribute to that number.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Ed Najarian - ISI Group Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I mean, as I just sort of look at and do net interest margin math, this looks -- this increase looks like something that had a -- it was part of the negative impact. Is this a number you expect to stabilize or come down in future quarters? Or would this trend of rising continue to happen?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I think if you think about the 3 things that I've given you, we are going to continue to extend repo. So that piece of it you'd expect. Clearly, with respect to the European stocks, that's a seasonal thing in the second quarter, as well as the hedging effectiveness. We would hope that those wouldn't continue. So I think, to answer your question, one, probably does; 2, don't.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And we'll go next to Nancy Bush with NAB Research.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Nancy Bush - NAB Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Two questions for you. First, on the Commercial Bank. I think you said that CRE declined by about $2.2 billion, and then you had some loan growth in Middle Market C&amp;I. Has the Middle Market C&amp;I loan growth continued as we've gone into the third quarter here? And was the CRE runoff planned or unplanned?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Start with the Commercial Real Estate. I think the -- given both the capital markets as the -- as well as the refinancing markets, I would say part of the real estate was planned and part of it, quite frankly, were assets that were either criticized or nonperformers coming off the books. So as we look at that Commercial Real Estate number, we obviously don't like to see loans going down at the same time that there was some stuff that you would have wanted to come off. And we feel very good about where the Commercial Real Estate portfolio is now and, quite frankly, are trying to figure out places to do more commercial real estate where it makes sense. With respect to the C&amp;I portfolio within the Middle Market, that's about $37 billion of the overall Commercial Banking portfolio. And if you go back and look at that since the second quarter of last year, that portfolio is up about 10%, and that really is the core guts of the client base that we're very focused on within the Commercial Bank.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Nancy Bush - NAB Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I guess the sort of the root of my question is the companies that we've seen report, thus far, are sort of reporting the glimmers of commercial beginning, commercial loan growth. And I just wanted to see if that was your experience as well or if you can just give us sort of an overall view of where -- whether we're at a growth inflection point yet?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I'd say, Nancy, as you came through the -- from the end of last year and the first part of this year, you were seeing David Darnell would say the core Middle Market book, the customers were more -- were optimistic, and they were starting to grow a little bit. I think that sort of flattened out a little bit, so there's still some growth as we pointed out here. But if you look at the utilization rates and stuff, they've now stabilized. Again, they were at a low probably 31% or 32%. They're sort of in the 34.5% to 30% range. They would be in a 43% range in normalized times. Now people have excess cash, but I'd say that as we've gone through the year this year, I think that people who are less aggressive -- our clients are less aggressive in the core broad middle market spectrum than they were earlier this year, but the loan balances are holding in and growing slightly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Nancy Bush - NAB Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Yes. Brian, and I just have one final question for you. We've been getting several articles lately about what seems to be a prominent change in the attitude toward homeownership in the U.S., want to get your opinion on that. And also, just when all is said and done here and whatever year that may happen, how do you see the mortgage business as a contributor to the bottom line at BAC?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Let me go to the second one first -- Nancy, because I think it kind of answers the first one in some respects. Leave aside the exact dollars and cents, but the way we see the Mortgage business and our company going forward is we have 50 million consumer households, 30 million have their core banking checking accounts with us, et cetera, our job is to provide mortgage products to not only our general customers in our Retail and Preferred segment, but also our both -- well, Global Wealth Management customers in a very strong, very focused and very -- in a very fair way. And that's what we're going to drive to and that's what you expect to see in our Mortgage business going forward. I think the idea of being in a stand-alone context, where we had a wholesale business, for example, a broker-driven business. We've gotten out of the -- reverse mortgage, we've gotten out of. We continue to shape our yield what the correspondent business looks like. But a -- the business that will be in, it will be a strong direct to consumer -- direct-to-retail, direct-to-the-consumer mortgage business, and that's where we're moving Barbara and the team and moving the business to. That actually fits into the capital demands of MSR and other things, as you could well figure out. So that's how we're going to run the business for the benefit of our customers, as if -- as the same way we're running all our business, making sure every ounce of our capital is used to support the core customer base and, frankly, to do the mortgage product very well for that customer base. When you back into the broader context, I think the homeownership discussion is a policy discussion I'd leave to policymakers. But as you look at our customers and listen to them and watch what they've gone through, I think that the people in the world, my children's age, are going to think differently about homeownership, in terms of the value of it and how it factors into their thinking, because of what they've seen going on around them. And I think that that's just the reality where we're in. Doesn't mean it's good or bad, it's just the reality. And I think with the population growth dynamics and things like that in the United States, I think that that's going to be the reality of a more sober society on this. And I think our jobs are to buy products into that and help people become homeowners, because it's ultimately something they may aspire to, but do it the right way.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And due to the time, we will take our final question from Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Christoph Kotowski - Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Yes. When you look at the trading results on Page 26 of the supplement, it looks like your total trading profits this quarter were almost exactly in line with the trailing 4 quarter average. And so I'm curious -- what you're -- is this the new normal, or do you still view this as a depressed trading environment? And then what's the outlook for this business? And if the revenues remain at this level that they've been in, is the expense side of that business properly structured then?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I'd say that -- I'd still say we're probably below normal right now in the minds of Tom and the team running it. The -- and so I think that you won't see what you saw, say, in the first quarter of last year and things like that. That was above -- way above normal. We tried to talk about -- we've talked about sort of $4.5 billion range that -- in total revenue, which includes this, plus the margin and other things. But -- so I think that that's -- I think we're still below the normal. The question is, unless you see the improvement back to normal, we will have to continue to work on the expense. And in fact, that's what Tom has been doing. If you look at our business, the headcount that he's had has been relatively flat. But -- we've done is deployed to -- in international space, for example -- obviously Asia being key component, where from a research side, we've got strong Asia-wide research ratings, Japan #1 rating, things like that. So we deployed resources there to help our teams, sales people to cover the clients. At the same time, the total deployed resources headcount has been flattish, and we've been taking it out of places where the opportunities aren't as big. So you ought to expect us to continue to manage the business that way. In the aggregate, this is a little below normal. If it doesn't get above normal, then the cost structure come down but -- and the comp structure is one of the quick ways to adjust it, but ultimately you got to keep factoring that in.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">At this time, I'd like to turn it back over to Mr. Brian Moynihan for closing comments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Thank you for your attention, and we look forward to talking to you in October.

Please go ahead, sir.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Kevin Stitt</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning. Before Brian Moynihan and Bruce Thompson begin their comments, let me remind you that this presentation does contain some forward-looking statements regarding both our financial condition and financial results, and that these statements involve certain risks that may cause actual results in the future to be different from our current expectations. These factors include, among other things, changes in economic conditions, changes in interest rates, competitive pressures within the financial services industry and legislative or regulatory requirements that may affect our businesses. For additional factors, please see our press release and SEC documents.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">And with that, let me turn it over to Brian</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Hi. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported net income of $6.2 billion or $0.56 a share after preferred dividends. There were a lot of moving parts that impacted numbers, and we'll get to those through the discussion here. In addition, our earnings benefited from our own credit spreads widening. It related to fair -- positive fair value adjustments and DVA gains. Those items, Bruce will cover along with the other significant items in the rest of the presentation. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Our core revenues continued to be adversely impacted by a challenging environment, as low interest rates and the European debt crisis persist. It is especially evident in our fixed income trading results for the quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">As we think about the third quarter, I think of 3 core areas. One of the areas is the continuation of the master strategic repositioning of our franchise. Another of the areas is the core operating platforms progress that we made in the quarter in each line of business. And the third area is the focus on the slow economy, and its impact on how we're going to run the company going forward. So let's first talk about the first area, the strategic transformation of the company. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">During the quarter, we made steady progress repositioning our business to focus on our core customers and clients. We finalized the reconfiguration of our Credit Card business that we began in 2009 to focus solely on U.S. core credit card customers, exiting non-U.S. portfolios such as Spain and Canada and now exited the U.K. We also sold off some of the financial institutions platforms in the United States which enabled competitors to offer cards to compete against us. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">In our mortgage area, we've exited our correspondent, previously exited our wholesale channels, which when you put all together focuses solely on a direct-to-retail channel. This is a position which enables to serve our core customer base and do it on a basis consistent with driving our franchise. In addition to repositioning those businesses, we've taken all our consumer businesses from our core consumer business through our Wealth Management businesses and put them under our new co -- one of our co-CEOs, David Darnell, to drive those businesses on a customer and client-focus basis. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">During the quarter, we also sold half our interest in CCB, lowered our private equity investment substantially and made further progress on noncore assets dispositions. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">As we move from a strategic transformation of the company to the line of the business, we continue to see momentum in our core lines of businesses. We extended approximately $141 billion in credit for the third quarter. Our average deposits continue to grow. Our average commercial loans increased in all our regions, although our consumer loans are still declining mainly in the noncore areas. Our net checking accounts grew for the third consecutive quarter and attrition remains low. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We're seeing good progress with initiatives to grow through adding financial services advisers in our branches and Small Business Bankers in our broad consumer areas. We're seeing steady progress in our Wealth Management businesses, U.S. Trust and Merrill Lynch, where we continue to add advisors and push forward in these market leading areas. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We continue to see solid performance on our commercial and corporate lending businesses, including Global Commercial Banking and Global Corporate Investment Bank. In addition, we retained our second place position in investment banking and produced solid international customer growth in that area. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Our credit quality and delinquencies continue to improve, while reserve coverage remains at high levels. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">As we think about the third area we're focused on, how to manage in a slow or long-term recovery, we're doing everything we can to continue repositioning the earnings of our company as we look forward. We continue to focus on driving growth in select areas, very select areas, but we're also focused on reducing expenses. Expenses remain elevated in large part due to nearly $2 billion in quarterly operating expenses at Legacy Asset Servicing. We hit our peak and headcount in July across the entire company, and are now managing down across all areas. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">LAS is at its peak staffing level, showed more of that overall staffing reduction should come through the bottom line. Our New BAC efficiency initiative is making progress. During the quarter, we completed a Phase 1 evaluation and now we're implementing, and you'll see the results as we come through the fourth quarter. The Phase 2 evaluation begins this month, and it will bear strong fruit. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">With that, let me turn it over to Bruce to go through the financials.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Thanks, Brian. And good morning, everyone. If I can ask you to flip to Page 5, and we'll start on the income statement. As Brian referenced, we made $6.2 billion for the quarter or $0.56 a share, and these numbers were affected by several significant items that I'll walk you through and go through in more detail as we get into the presentation. The quarter did include a credit mark on structured liabilities under fair value option that resulted in a positive mark of $4.5 billion as a result of our credit spreads widening, and as you look at our financials you'll see that in other income. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Keep in mind that mark, whether it be positive or negative, does not impact regulatory capital ratios such as Tier 1 common but does affect GAAP capital. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">The widening of our credit spreads also generated a DVA gain of $1.7 billion related to our trading liabilities within our Global Banking and Markets business, and I'll get into more detail on that later in the presentation. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Our equity investments had a net $1.4 billion in gains, driven primarily by 2 sale transactions and a write-down. As Brian referenced, we did sell half of our investments in CCB for $8.3 billion in proceeds. That generated a pretax gain of $3.6 billion. X our sale of China Construction Bank, equity investments would have been a negative $2.2 billion. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">As we move to net interest income, we had 2 areas that negatively affected net interest income. The first was hedge ineffectiveness, a negative $600 million as well as a negative $400 million associated with the acceleration of amortization of premiums on securities during the quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">If we move down to the income tax expense line, it reflects a charge of $782 million related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets in our U.K. business that we mentioned last quarter, as a result of the July enactment of a 2% reduction in the U.K. corporate tax rate. If we take the other items on this page, and add both the positives and the negatives, the other adjustments totaled a loss of $800 million, and I'll touch on these different aspects as we get through the presentation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">If you flip to Page 6, and look at the balance sheet, you can see that assets are down Q2 to Q3 while deposits grew moderately during the quarter. Other items I would point to in the quarter, you saw a $33 billion reduction in risk weighted assets that contributed to the improvement in our Tier 1 common ratio. We reduced long-term debt by approximately $28 billion and as we look at tangible book value per common share, that increased $0.57 to $13.22 at the end of the third quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Asset quality continues to be very strong. Our allowance at the end of the quarter was approximately $35 billion, which is roughly 3.8% of total loans, 1.74x annualized charge-offs, and we saw $1 billion reduction in our nonperforming loans and leases.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">If we flip to Page 7, and look at funding and liquidity, as we've talked about over the last couple of quarters, we continue to proactively reduce both our short-term and our long-term debt. During the third quarter, we reduced short-term unsecured borrowings by approximately $15 billion to immaterial amounts at both the parent and the broker-dealer, as we repaid our commercial paper and eliminated the master notes program at the broker-dealer. In addition to the reductions in short-term debt, long-term debt also came down by approximately $28 billion, as maturities continue to outpace issuances.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">These reductions of $43 billion were the primary drivers of the $39 billion decline in our excess liquidity sources to $363 billion. When you think about that $363 billion, unlike others, realized debt does not include approximately $194 billion in additional liquidity that's available to our banking entities via pledging assets to the Home Loan Banks in the Fed discount window. As we think about time-to-required funding at the parent, it increased to 27 months during the quarter from 22 months at the end of the second quarter, as we generated substantial parent-company liquidity and debt maturities after 2012 or lower.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">As I think everyone is aware, Moody's downgraded our credit ratings late in the third quarter based on their beliefs around potential government support. We obviously disagree with those actions in that we believe that their views of unsupported credit ratings do not sufficiently reflect the significant progress we've made, improving our capital and liquidity positions, shedding legacy and noncore assets and managing our risk down. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">That being said, we had worked hard over the course of the last 9 months to be prepared to the extent that we did receive a downgrade and feel very good about the way that we minimized the potential impact. Most importantly, since the downgrade, we have not seen any change in our global excess liquidity sources.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Moving to Slide 8 and looking at net interest income. As we've spoken about before and as we think about getting ready for Basel III, we're obviously very focused on managing interest rate risk across the company and minimizing OCI exposure in higher-rate environments and managing the duration of our securities given the low level of rates. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On an FTE basis, net interest income was down approximately $754 million for the quarter. That decrease was driven primarily by 2 factors. Asset hedge ineffectiveness of $400 million and the acceleration of amortization of premiums on securities of $500 million due to the faster prepayment expectations on mortgage securities. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Importantly, if we back out these 2 adjustments, our net interest income was actually up as the positive contributions to net interest income from lower debt balances as well as reductions in our rates paid on deposits more than offset the reductions that we saw from consumer balances and yields.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As we look forward to the fourth quarter, and we assume that rates stayed within that same range that they are today, we would not expect to see any meaningful impact on net interest income due to asset hedge ineffectiveness or premium adjustments. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">I'm going to move through Slide 9 quickly, which just reflects the divergence that we've seen within our commercial -- or excuse me, our Consumer Real Estate Services business from the balance of our businesses and get to the actual segments themselves on Slide 10.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">If you look at Slide 10, you can see that the Deposits business had net income of $276 million, which was down $148 million from the prior quarter, driven principally by lower net interest income, which was partially offset by increases in our noninterest or fee income category. Average deposits are up significantly from the third quarter of 2010 and down very modestly at 1% due to seasonal reasons from the second quarter of 2011. As I mentioned before, the rates paid on our consumer deposits declined from 29 basis points during the second quarter of this year to 25 basis points in the third quarter. Importantly, this was a third consecutive quarter where we saw positive net new checking accounts during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We move to our Cards Services business. The Cards Services business generated net income of $1.3 billion during the quarter, which was down about $675 million from the second quarter due primarily to higher provision expense and lower revenues which were partially offset by declines in noninterest expense. The decline quarter-over-quarter in net revenues was driven by the portfolio sales that we accomplished in the second quarter and realized gains from those, as well as the NII impact from lower yields and loan balances.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As we look at provision, provision did increase by $735 million from the quarter. I think it's important to note that we actually saw charge-offs decline $403 million or 17%, and that was more than offset by lower reserve releases of approximately $1.1 billion. Importantly, despite some of what we've seen out in the economy, we've continued to see very strong credit performance within our Cards Services business, and we show you here that the different delinquency categories continue to improve Q2 to Q3. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">From a low-level balance perspective, average loans did decline by about $3.8 million -- excuse me, $3.8 billion quarter-over-quarter due principally to higher payments, charge-offs, portfolio divestitures and the run-off of the noncore portfolios that we've spoken about before. The actual core portfolio was up very modestly during the quarter. As you think about purchase volumes, if we adjust for our portfolio divestitures, card purchase volume was up 5% from the third quarter of last year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">The last point I would make on this page is that we have continued to see growth within the new card area, with new card accounts growing 17%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As we leave this page, I do want to note though that the sale, as you look at this data, that the sale of the Canadian Card business and with the intention to market the European Card business, that the results of those 2 areas have been removed from this data and moved to all other, and the prior period results were restated to reflect that. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Just to remind you with the sale of our Canadian Credit Card business, which has about $8 billion in receivables, we would expect that sale to close during the fourth quarter of this year. The impact of that on Tier 1 common intangible common equity will be positive when the transaction closes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">If we move to the Global Wealth and Investment Management area, net income of $347 million during the quarter was down $159 million from the second quarter of '11 as lower revenue and as we faced -- or had lower revenue and higher credit costs. On the revenue side, the decline in revenues was due to lower interest rates and lower transactional revenue but, importantly, was partially offset by Record Asset Management fees driven by continued inflows into long-term assets under management.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">The decline in client balances during the quarter was driven almost entirely by lower market levels in the stock market. As we look at Deposits, Deposits were, basically, flat during the quarter, despite the fact that we reduced the overall rates paid on our GWIM deposits by 7 basis points during the quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Lastly, this was the 9th consecutive quarter that we saw increases in client facing associates, and we added a net 475 financial advisers during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Moving to Slide 13 in Commercial Banking. Net income for the quarter was down $331 million to $1.50 billion, primarily due to lower loan loss reserves and some small revenue declines. The revenue declines were due to lower net interest income, as well as the absence of a gain on the settlement of a portfolio that we saw during the second quarter. Importantly, expenses were down quarter-over-quarter, as the business continues to manage costs tightly. And also during the quarter, we saw a fairly significant increase in average deposits as they grew by $7.4 billion quarter-over-quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Loans were generally flat during the quarter. We saw continued decreases in our Commercial Real Estate. Commercial and Industrial loans were generally flat, and we saw auto loans increase by about $1.2 billion. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">The last point I would make within the commercial sector is that we do continue to see very strong credit quality. Our reservable credit size exposure declined from $27 billion at the end of the second quarter to $22.8 billion at the end of the third, and our nonperformers declined from $7.6 billion -- or excuse me, $7.4 billion to $6.6 billion during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">If we flip to Slide 14 in our Global Banking and Markets area. You can see that the results reflected a loss of $302 million, driven by decreased sales and trading activity, lower Investment Banking fees and the U.K. tax rate change during the quarter that I referenced in my opening remarks, partially offset by our DVA gains. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">As you look at the sales and trading revenues, you can see that they declined to $2.8 billion, a $1 billion decline from the second quarter, primarily driven by our FICC business due to the adverse market conditions that we saw during the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, our results included DVA gains of $1.7 billion in the quarter, as our credit spreads widened throughout the quarter versus gains of $121 million in the second quarter of the year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">As you look at the individual components within our FICC business and if we back out DVA, what we saw was a relatively strong performance by our rates and currencies business that was down 14% quarter-over-quarter while we had small losses in our structured credit trading, certain other credit trading and our fair value option loan book. Also keep in mind during the third quarter as a result of winding down our proprietary trading business, revenue in that business decreased from $434 million in the first half of this year to 0 in the third quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">If we move from FICC to the equities business and once again back out DVA, cash equities performed relatively well, being down only 7% quarter-over-quarter while the primary declines in our equities business were due to equity derivatives.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">If we move from the sales and trading to the banking side of the business, Firmwide investment banking fees, excluding self-led deals, were $942 million, down 44% from what was a very strong second quarter due to both market uncertainty as well as declined in global fee pools. That being said, I think it's important to note that we did maintain our #2 ranking globally in that investment banking fees. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">If we move to loans and deposits, loan balances did increase nicely by $10.7 billion during the quarter, driven primarily by growth in domestic and international corporate loans and international trade finance. Average deposit balances were up 4% to $121 billion, as corporate clients continue to increase liquidity in an uncertain market environment. We continue to chip away at our legacy positions, those declined 3% to $16.6 billion, led by reductions in auction rate securities as well as CDOs. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We also saw a significant declines in our VaR during the quarter. Our daily average trading VaR once again 3 year at the 99% confidence interval was down $65 billion -- or excuse me, $65 million on a linked-quarter basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">If we move to Slide 15, I want to highlight here how our mortgage model is changing. As we all know, Countrywide had a large scale platform that allowed for high volumes of origination but the mortgage market has declined, and we're obviously being required to hold much more capital against our MSR asset. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">As many of you have seen, we recently announced our plan to exit of the correspondent Mortgage business, which we would expect to complete by the end of the year. This business is clearly not consistent with the focus on our core customers and will require us to carry the MSR assets on an unleveraged basis under proposed Basel III capital requirements. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">By exiting, we will not add to the MSR and importantly over time, the current MSR asset associated with the correspondent business will run off. Also during the quarter, we sold certain pieces of our MSR and we would expect to continue to do so going forward. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Within Legacy Asset Servicing, our operating costs remain high. That being said, we did see a 6% decline in the size of our portfolio within legacy asset during the -- from the second quarter to the third quarter, and we're obviously working hard to continue to reduce that. Importantly, the focus within the Mortgage business will be to be the secured lender of choice with our customers while continuing to manage down expenses to deliver on this goal. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">If we flip to Page 16, and look at the Consumer Real Estate Services business. I'm going to ask you to focus on the right side of the results given the large number of adjustments that we saw during the second quarter of this year. On an adjusted basis, you can see that from the 2 quarters, that the net loss improved from $953 million in the second quarter to $601 million in the third quarter, primarily due to lower credit loss provision as well as improved net interest income, partially offset by less favorable MSR hedging results. Home Loans did produced a modest profit in the quarter, while the Legacy Asset Servicing side recorded a loss from elevated expenses. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">As we look at production income, first mortgage production was down 18% due to primarily to us shrinking and, ultimately, getting out of the correspondent and wholesale areas. Importantly, our core production income was flat relative to the second quarter, as improved margins more than offset lower lock volumes. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">You can see in the bottom left, as far as the selected charges, reps and warrants were $278 million for the quarter, litigation of $290 million and assessments and waivers of $350 million. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">If we spend a minute on the MSR during the quarter, you can see the MSR asset decreased significantly from $12.4 billion to $7.9 billion due primarily to declines in interest rates. And you can see the cap rate on that asset went from 78 basis points at the end of the second quarter to 52 basis points at the end of the third quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">A couple of pieces of sequential data on Page 17, as we look at the Legacy Asset Servicing area. You can see that our 60-plus delinquent first mortgages declined 4% from roughly $1.211 million to $1.158 million. Our pretax loss, x notable items, improved from a loss of $2.2 billion to $1.4 billion due primarily to the higher net interest income as well as lower provisions. The other point here is that we have had to add several thousand people to satisfy our obligations to do the mortgaging and with some of the regulations that we're seeing in that area.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">On Page 18, all other total revenue of $6.3 billion, you can see in the middle of the page that revenue was primarily driven by the fair value adjustment on our structured liabilities, the gains on our sales of debt securities, as well as equity investment income. One of the things that I do want to highlight during the quarter that we accomplished, you can see that our Global Principal Investments area, which was primarily the legacy private equity portfolio, was reduced from $10.8 billion to $6.9 billion. And as you look at our total equity investment exposure, it came down by roughly 40% during the quarter from $44 billion to just under $27 billion, which, clearly, should look to minimize some of the volatility going forward. And once again, just want to highlight that the Canadian Card and the U.K. Card business had been moved to this segment during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">From an expense perspective, on Slide 19, you can see noninterest expense decreased from $22.9 billion to $17.6 billion during the quarter. And if you look to back out our mortgage-related items during the quarter, we still saw a nice decline in our expense base, Q2 to Q3. If we look at headcount, while headcount was up very modestly from Q2 to Q3, it does not pick up 2,000 people that we've notified that will be leaving the company and are still in that number. And obviously, as we go into the fourth quarter and we look to execute on New BAC, we look to make continued progress on that front.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">As we think about New BAC, on Slide 20, let me just spend a minute on this. Obviously, as we've gone through the low rate environment, unemployment where it is, an economy that's not growing at the like -- at the pace that we would like, it does provide some headwinds from a revenue perspective. The one lever that we obviously have to offset that is the expense side. And as Brian referenced in his opening remarks, we're in the process of completing our initial planning related to Phase 1 of New BAC, and we'll move into the second phase of New BAC later this month.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">As we talked about in the presentation a few weeks ago, we completed 6 mergers over the last 5 years. That added approximately 150,000 new associates. This growth in our expense base obviously provides a lot of opportunities to streamline and reduce costs going forward. That why New BAC makes sense and why it's attainable. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">To summarize what we detailed for New BAC in September, we divided our expenses into 2 categories, controllable costs and other direct costs. In Phase 1, we're focusing on our consumer businesses, along with small business banking, tech and ops and support areas. Based on our analysis, we have a goal to achieve $5 billion in cost savings or about 18% of the expenses associated with these areas. As I said, our Phase 2 evaluations began this month and we expect to complete them in April of next year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">As you look at Phase 2, be careful to extrapolate what we believe will accomplish in Phase 1 to Phase 2 because the headcount in Phase 2 is about 50% of Phase 1 and some of the businesses in Phase 2 already have low efficiency ratios such as the commercial banks. We'll obviously update you on Phase 2 during the first part of next year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">If we move down to page of the expenses that relate to sold our liquidating businesses, our goal is to obviously wind those down over time. And finally, in other expenses, most of these are fixed, although we expect to bring down merger charges and expect to work towards goals of reducing litigation settlement-related costs and waivers and assessments over the next few years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">If we move from the businesses to credit and the trends that we've seen in credit. As we look at consumer credit trends on Slide 21, we continue to be very pleased with the progress that we're making. If you look at consumer credit trends quarter-over-quarter, you can see continued declines in net charge-offs, 30-plus performing delinquencies, as well as our nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties. You can also see that provision expense was roughly $3.5 billion for the quarter and included roughly $1 billion of loan loss reserves. Our allowance for the consumer businesses was over $30 billion at the end of the third quarter, 4.9% of total loans and 1.7x our annualized charge-offs. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">The last point on consumer credit that I would make is that this is the first time in several quarters where we've not had evaluation reserves for our purchase credit impaired portfolios.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Flipping quickly to Slide 22, you can see that our 30-plus performing past dues in residential mortgages continue to decline during the third quarter, and our Home Equity was roughly flat. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">On Slide 23, we highlight our nonperformers in both residential mortgage, and Home Equity improved modestly during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">On Slide 24, as we get to our commercial credit trends, credit continue to perform very well within the commercial books. We had nice declines in our nonperformers, as well as our reservable criticized. Our total provision, which was a benefit of $59 million, included a reserve reduction of $670 million during the quarter. And once again, on the commercial side, roughly $4.8 billion of an allowance, 1.6% of coverage of assets and just under 2x annualized charge-offs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Moving from credit to capital. You can see here, we show our Tier 1 common equity and Tier 1 capital ratios and the progression and progress that we've made. Importantly, we increased each of these measures by between 45 and 50 basis points during the quarter. And as you think about these numbers, realize that they are now higher than where we were at the end of the first quarter before we took the roughly $20 billion in charges that we took during the second quarter. In addition to building our common equity, these ratios also benefited from reductions in risk weighted assets of about 2.4% or $33 billion during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Flipping to Slide 26, we show both tangible common equity and tangible book. They were both up nicely during the quarter, in part due to the positive fair value marks, which I do want to remind people, can reverse themselves when spreads tighten. The tangible common equity ratio did close the quarter at 6.25%, up 38 basis points, and tangible book of $13.22 was up $0.57 or 5%. The tangible book value also reflects the impact of the drop in the market value of the CCB shares that we hold as of the end of the third quarter of this year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">The last comment I would make is the progress that we continue to make as we look to move and meet our objectives on Basel III. You'll recall during the last quarter, we gave guidance that we had a target of reduction of risk weighted assets on Basel III of $200 billion to $250 billion. As we looked and got through the quarter, we've now identified all of the assets that we need to move or mitigate to accomplish that. And during the quarter, we worked through more than half of those reductions during the third quarter. And as a result of that, we continue to be very comfortable with our phased-in -- our fully phased-in guidance of 6.75% to 7% at the end of 2012 -- yes, excuse me, at the end of 2012. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And with that, we'd like to go ahead and open it up for questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p9\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Glenn Schorr from Nomura.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Curious, inside your commentary in NIM compression. How much is the securities book at the Investment Banking impacting that on a quarterly basis?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">It's really not much at all. If you look at what's in the investment bank, it's flattish. So it's really the 2 items that I highlighted, Glenn.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. Cool. And then maybe just to comment, it's been kind of quiet on both the foreclosure settlement front and the private label putback cases. I think we're due any day now to hear about the status on a judgment on the MBIA case. I wonder if you can update, there's 3 different pieces there, and I think they're weighing very heavily on investors' minds. So I'm wondering if you could give us any update there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Sure. I think if we start with the MBIA case. You obviously have read what we've read, that there were presentations made, I guess, it's been several weeks now, and we continue to wait for and get feedback on that. I think one of the important things that we need to mention as we think about MBIA, this is obviously the case that they're bringing in and talking to us about reps and warrants. And as you look within our numbers, you can see that there are significant counterparty that we believe at this point owe us a fair bit of money and we've marked -- that's marked pretty heavily within our books. As you think about the Attorney General-DOJ settlement, which you've seen, obviously, there continues to be a lot of noise and a lot of discussions on that. But there's really not much new to report from our perspective on that. And then as you think about the mortgage putbacks, I guess, quiet is a relative term but I think obviously, the big piece and what everyone is still waiting to hear back, is to some of the different presentations and objections that have been made on the Gibbs &amp; Bruns case. And I'd say at this point, you know as much as we do on that front as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">On the putbacks themselves, if you look at -- excuse me, if you look at the -- it's kind of leveled off at this high pace, so it's good that they're not picking up. Has the FHA got more involved or are they putting back loans? And are they increasing the dialogue? Because it seems that way in certain spots.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yes, I think if you look at our numbers and the claims, you're really not seeing anything from FHA materially reflected in those claims. And you continue to -- obviously, you see some of the same noise about some of the discussions on FHA putbacks. But it's not something that's been material within the numbers we've shown.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay, last one, quickie. In the Home Equity book, can you give us a bigger than a breadbox-type number on how much of the book is interest only or due to start amortizing principal soon?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Why don't we get back to you with that exact number. I think, clearly, a chunk of it starts in the 2013, 2014 timeframe, but why don't we get back to you [indiscernible].</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And we'll take our next question from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">A couple of questions. First, just to clarify in the net interest income and NIM outlook. I think if I heard you correctly, if rates stay where they are right now, do you expect the NIM or net interest income dollars to be relatively stable in 4Q?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">We would clearly, with the assumptions that you just gave, we would expect the net interest income to migrate back towards the second quarter level, that's correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. So it's actually up versus the reported 2Q -- or 3Q level because you don't have the onetime hits from hedging or amortization?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">That's correct. And we obviously, as I talked about in the funding and liquidity, continue to reduce the debt footprint that we have which provides us a benefit as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay, that makes sense. And then separately, as we think about the cost savings program, or the Phase 1 that will generate about $5 billion of savings, you did mention some severance and tech charges in the release. And I was just wondering if you have an estimate of what those might be and the timing of that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes, I think, let me put that in 2 different buckets. The first is from the technology perspective. We're continuing to work through that. But clearly, the goal and what we're trying to do is to basically fund the tech and ops spending that we have within the context of the tech and ops run rate that you see in the numbers today. So the goal as we think about those numbers, will be to fund it within the context of the spending that you're seeing within the numbers here today. As it relates to severance and the disclosure we put out there, within the numbers that we reported this quarter, there was roughly $145 million of severance that we saw for activities as it related to employees that were more normal course. And I think as you look forward, we're obviously continuing to work through the final implementations, or the final implementation schedule. But from a severance perspective, I don't think you're going to see any big lump. It's going to be more, you're going to see it, as we work through and make certain decision with respect to certain actions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Matt, just to back up, the ideas in Phase 1, I think 25%, 30% of them had technology aspects to them in order to be. So there's a significant amount of non-technology effort there, and we will prioritize the non-technology to move it forward because the technology not only cost money and we'll do it within the run rate we have now but, secondly, it also takes time. So we're working on the implementation schedule, but the numbers that we quoted will be the impacts that we'll achieve in the savings net of the current run rate and technology that we have today.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. And then just lastly, it might be too really for you to comment on it, but there was an article in the Wall Street Journal today, talking about a potential agreement in which banks would reduce the mortgage-related for borrowers that are underwater but still current. I'm just wondering if you had thoughts on that from a big picture point of view, and any numbers on how it might impact you?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We have no comment on it at this one.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And we'll take our next question from the side of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Just one clarification on the NII. Bruce, is your outlook that, that could be back to the second quarter level because you're changing your strategy around the hedging of the NII and the OCI? Are you lightening up on what you're doing in the hedging or...</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">No. It's not that we're changing the way that we're hedging at all. It's really, as you think about the 2 numbers, it's the absence of the ineffectiveness as well as the prepays that we wouldn't expect to repeat itself in the -- during the fourth quarter. I think importantly, if you think about where we are now and you just used the 10-year treasury as a reference point, at the end of September, the 10-year was at 1.90% and it's been bouncing around between 2.10% and 2.25% over the course of the last week. So think about those as the benchmarks as we made these comments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. And are you talking about the net interest income and the margin percent, or were you referencing one of the other when you talk about going back to the second quarter level?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Dollars.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. And then on trading. Given the trading, and FICC particularly was so bad this quarter, can you comment on how you're doing so far in the fourth quarter on trading? Have you seen things improve?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes, I mean, I think as you'd expect it, if you think about months that we had during the third quarter, July, while clearly not at what we have seen during the early part of the year, July was a reasonably good month in the quarter. Obviously, the volatility in the credit markets were particularly challenging in August and September. And what I would say is, as we look at October to date, I would say October has been a fair bit better than what we would have seen in the August and September months.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. And then on the AG settlement, the discussions about what was -- I felt like last quarter you mentioned that you were trying to build reserves for that. Obviously, no one knows what's going to come out of it, but in terms of any financial penalties that comes, have you tried to contemplate some reserve building for that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I think as we said when we took our charges in the second quarter, we did put up some reserves for that. There's really been nothing firm that has come out during the third relative to the second quarter. So those reserves for that item on the books of the third quarter are the same as they were at the end of the second.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. And that shows up in your litigation reserves and we don't know the balance of that, is that correct?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">That's correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. And the final thing was on the assessments and waivers, those went down this quarter. Those have to do with foreclosure delays. What's the driver of that, and why did they get better this quarter? And what do you see for the next couple of quarters on that line?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes. I think that, that number is obviously fluid. If you go back, we took $230 million during the fourth quarter, given that we had a sense that they were coming. And if we just go back and look, we had $550 million, down to $485 million. So we're seeing it trending down. And obviously as we get through the foreclosure pipeline quicker, we would expect that to continue to decline. So looking forward, we clearly expect the fourth quarter to be better than the third quarter as we look forward. And it's just that you can never predict exactly where you're going to be given we don't have perfect visibility to when foreclosures happen. But clearly, we'd expect the fourth quarter to be better than the third.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. And then the final thing for me was just on the GSE putback behavior. You mentioned that the behavior continues to change. I assumed this is Fannie Mae, since you're kind of done it at least on the Countrywide side with Freddie. What's been changing about the behavior? And why is it tough to predict from here?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes, I would just make a couple of comments. I think that what we've seen is that they have thrown over the wall some vintages, in amounts in vintages, that are older than what we've seen. Unlike many others, we have certain contract with Fannie that speaks to a normal course of doing business, and we'll obviously process and push through those that we think that were due and fight those that we don't think are due based on the contract we have with them.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And we'll take our next question from Jefferson Harralson with KBW.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Jefferson Harralson - Keefe, Bruyette, &amp; Woods, Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I was hoping just to ask a broad question of pre-pre, pretax, pre-provision expectation. Originally, I think we're talking about $40 billion to $45 billion a year would be in a possible range. A lot of things have changed since then, we've had a lot of divestitures. I guess how do you think about pre-pre, the level this quarter, versus where you can get to and how do you get there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I think, keep in broad strokes, that when we talk about, we were talking about an environment where that we all thought would happen over the next couple of years where we could get back to a normalized -- more normal Fed funds rate of 1.5%, 2% at least. You would see interest rate structure moves and that obviously still has a heavy impact on us and the Fed has made it clear, they're going to keep it there for a couple of years. And that the second element is in this quarter we're down because, as someone point out earlier, the trading business was down and that at the margin cost us a lot of PPNR. When you think about how we move forward, the key there now is going to be is revenues are going to be more subdued as to get more cost out and we've outlined what we're doing in the New BAC and other matters to get there. And I think you'll see that play out as we go quarter-by-quarter here. The other thing that you pointed out is the PPNR contribution, the Card business was obviously high in that math and we're selling part of that. The net profit of that is lower, but it will have an impact on the PPNR. So as we sort of go through this quarter, and get to look at it, we'll share with you an update on that probably in the first quarter of next year, along with the fourth quarter results. But think of the way we get there broadly as a more normalized interest rate environment for several billion dollars a year. The cost take out, just Legacy Asset Services being almost $2 billion a quarter now. And operating cost, not the charges or assessment, just pure operating costs. And that coming out and then the rest of the cost structure and then how that gets us there. Offsetting, we got Durbin still to come, and a few other things and then some of the divestitures.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And we'll take our next question from Brennan Hawken with UBS.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So yesterday, a competitor highlighted that they were seeing some signs of troubles in TDRs. So I was hoping you could maybe give some color on what you guys are seeing in these credits and what's your view of mods?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">TDRs on the consumer side or on the commercial side?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">In mortgage consumer.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I did not see the specific reference, but we've not seen any issue with respect to TDRs, quite frankly, either on the commercial or the consumer side.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. And then maybe can we get a little more color on the FICC results, x DVA. Clearly, it was weak and you highlighted some weakness in structured and credit but maybe we could dig in a little bit more? Was there a big headwind from inventory marks? And quarter-over-quarter, what sort of percentage change in the flow business did you guys see?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Let me -- let's start back from the broad perspective, I'll let Bruce take you through some of the numbers. But if you think about the last time we had -- last year second quarter, we had sort of an outsize move in terms of FICC versus the competition. And largely, remember, that we have a very strong business in the origination side, the leverage finance side, the capital market side which then helps feed our business and that business freezes up when the market freezes up. So we had a freeze up in the second quarter 2010 when Europe was going and Greece was going a little bit sideways and then it happened again in August and September. That being said, the team did a good job of managing the risk, kept the risk down, and Bruce will take you through some of the numbers. But we did have some marks and moving some positions and things like that. But overall, they ended up making some money. But overall, the job is to stay out of the way of risk and they did a good job of managing that. So Bruce can take you through the details, but remember because our heavy issuer side business and in the leverage finance and other areas, this is a business, when it slows down, we lose a fair amount of revenue, not only from origination side and capital markets but also as it plays through the trading platform. Bruce?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yes. I think that the first thing I would say, as I referenced, that the rates and currency business on a relative basis, performed better than the others. And if you look through the individual categories within the fixed income business, whether it be Structured Credit Trading, whether it be our Credit Trading business, whether it be our Mortgage business, and then the other thing that we have that's a little bit different than our competitors is that we have our fair value option loan book that also shows up in the fixed income area. You would have seen all of those 4 areas get beat up a little bit. But as it relates to any legacy positions or any significant losses that were incurred, we wouldn't have seen that. The other thing that's out there that I know there's been some things on is just about some of the underwriting in the pipelines of assets that people have. Our team actually did a very good job in that they hedged on the front end some of the commitments to distribute and any changes in that were very, very modest in the quarter. So I think kind of going back to what Brian said, we tend to be very much driven by the new issue business. It was slow. So within those credit trading areas, they were slightly negative but nothing really material in any one business that merits calling out.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. All right. That's really helpful. And then just a last quick one. Any change to the home price sensitivity that you guys laid out last quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">The only, I'd say, the only thing that's -- nothing material from a home price sensitivity that would change. The only thing that I would say is that if you look out with where consensus is, we're now factoring into our models and what we put through the P&amp;L was home prices looking to be down about 2.6% from where we are now until the end of 2012, which is slightly more negative than what we had when we reported last quarter, and that's reflected in the numbers that we've shown.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And we'll go next to the side of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I know this isn't part of the first phase of the New BAC but, obviously, it's another quarters gone by where your trading, core trading levels, are significantly below the $4 billion or $4.5 billion that you kind of aspired to. How do you think about the cost structure of that business at this stage?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So you're correct, and part of that is that -- so Tom has began reducing headcount and we'll do that in advance of doing the work on Phase 2. So think about 2 aspects to it. One is sort of a, for lack of a better term, a capacity reduction that he's gone through now. And during the quarter, as we've already talked about, we reduced headcount in some of the trading and Investment Banking and areas generally around the world and in the U.S. He'll continue to make those moves as we move towards the Phase 2. The Phase 2 is it takes the work and change it, so the first reduction will occur before that, and Tom has made some of those changes and we'll continue to make them. But we agree with you the market is going to be and the economy is going to be such that the revenue is going to be below, and we're going to continue to take down the cost structure. Now one of the easy things in this business versus other businesses, so much of its variable comps which comes down easier but, ultimately, you have to reduce the heads and the infrastructure, and Tom is going through that right now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. Kind of a separate topic related to kind of the consumer side. We've kind of discussed your actions in terms of the overdraft fees and the point-of-sale, and now you've kind of adjusted pricing. Can you talk about what your expectations are for kind of the size of the consumer bank, post all of that? I mean, have you kind of put that in thought, as to will it shrink and by how much, and how does that work?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Well, I think if you think about the Consumer business, generally, the high-net worth businesses as we continue to grow, continue to grow advisors, continue to grow headcount, and when we come into the Consumer business, if you think about the 2 broad customer groups that we talked about, our retail customer group and our preferred customer group. And preferred customer group, we continue to add resources there. Preferred includes small business, so we've added financial services advisors to help capture the investment side opportunity. We've added more personal bankers. We've added more Small Business Bankers. And all that has generated significant revenue growth. On the retail business, it's more about optimizing the cost structure. And we've been, there, we've been taking action on the branches as we've shown you. I think this quarter another 25 or 30 branch reductions, the last quarter was 60. We continue to reduce that. So it's not small in terms of deposits and so on, in terms of the checking accounts, that keeps growing. But it's smaller in terms of infrastructure and cost structure, we're at 240-odd basis points of operating cost per deposit which we think leads the industry, and we'll continue to drive it down. So if you think about it from a core sort of checking Consumer business, optimizing the cost structure underneath the customers we have, and then growing in the areas that we can and with the investments and penetration of, then on the product side, the Cards and the Mortgages. Mortgages on a direct-to-retail basis is where we're going, those numbers are in the data, you can see how that will be. And then Card, absent the U.K., et cetera, is kind of at the stability level from the core U.S. book. Now we still have some run-off portfolios in there that were from before that we're running down, but from a core U.S. book, we're relatively stable, so it will sort of be that size. And that will give -- so that's sort of the 2 product sides of it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I guess, Brian, what I was just trying to get at is the increase of the fees. Do you have a sense as to how much or how many of those retail customers you're kind of willing to let go?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I think that we think that as you look at the customer base, when we look at the profile customers who have their entire banking relationship with us and those that don't, a lot of people can quantify, will qualify and do qualify not to pay the fees that we've been talking about because they have their whole relationship with us, or a large part of that relationship. So as you look at our sales process now, we're selling about 80% of primary checking -- what we call first checking or primary checking relationships, the core relationships. If a person deposits their paycheck, if a person carries their sort of nest egg, what they're saving on the run rate, all of that will help them qualify. So we're comfortable with the people having the relationship, being a card, a mortgage, and what they do to get out of the fee. The issue is when people split their relationship and use our convenience and our access and our 18,000 ATMs and our no foreign ATM fees and our online banking product and all that, and yet have their relationship elsewhere, that is tough for us to afford to provide, and we need to provide to all our customers to be competitive. And so the fees are to get people to bring more relationships that we're comfortable with that we'll end up in a good dynamic there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And we'll go next to the side of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">One follow-up on the NII and then a question on the mortgage. On the NII, you indicated that if rates stayed where they are today, you'd be back at 2Q levels of NII. That takes into consideration the prepays that are going to be coming, hitting you in fourth quarter. Obviously, there was reasonable amount of folks that haven't yet been able to close on their refi at this stage.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yes. It's a good question, I probably should have been a little bit more clear. Keep in mind that amortization amount that we took in the third quarter was not reflective of prepays that we actually saw in the securities. It was us adjusting our assumptions in the models to reflect the prepays that we think that we will see, based on the interest rate environment that we saw at the end of the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. And then assets, you're asset sensitive. Can you tell us how your asset sensitivity change q-on-q, or where you are now versus where you were at quarter end?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">With respect to where we went from, we do continue to be asset sensitive, but there's no question, I would not say that there was any material change from our level of asset sensitivity from the second quarter to third quarter, though.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And that includes the planned long-term debt roll off?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">It sure does.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. And can you give us a sense of how much long-term debt that you're planning on rolling off over the course of the next 3 or 4 quarters?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Sure. If you look at where we are and focus on the parent company, the parent company has got, I believe, it's roughly $12 billion that rolls off over the next 90 days. And then as you go out over the course of the year, realize that we've got roughly $30 billion that rolls off, that's the big number during the second quarter of next year when TLGP runs off. So those are the significant numbers there. And then you would expect over time, given the liquidity that we have at the bank, that we will continue to run off the funding that we have at the bank as opposed to rolling it over, given the liquidity that we have at the company.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Great. Okay. And that's all been prepaid, so to speak, with the cash balances?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">That's exactly correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And then lastly on mortgage. Can you just give us a sense as to how the impact of shutting down the correspondent channel is going through flow through the P&amp;L, and the time frame?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Well, I think if you look at the P&amp;L this quarter, and you look at -- and look at our comments that we've made with respect to volumes, we've started to see that during the third quarter. And clearly, the majority that will be gone off, or run-off at the end of the fourth. You should not expect to see any material change, though, in the overall P&amp;L from correspondent, realizing that we're in the process of working through and taking out the costs associated with that and there can, obviously, at points in time, be a quarter lag in that. The most important thing that you're going to see with respect to our financials, though, in the correspondent, is that the correspondent business, when you originated a loan, it came with an MSR associated with it that, obviously, doesn't count from Basel III perspective. So what you will see is a slowdown in the new bookings of MSRs that come on the balance sheet as a result of exiting the segment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And we'll take our next question from Matthew Burnell with Wells Fargo.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Just a couple of questions. First on Page 40 of the supplement, it looks like you had additions or higher levels of new nonaccrual loans in the third quarter, both in the consumer portfolio but also in the commercial portfolio. I'm just curious, if you can give us a little color as to what you're seeing in those portfolios? And how you drove down the NPA levels in both those portfolios on a quarter-end by quarter-end basis?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">If I'm -- so I guess that if you think, and if we look at the consumer NPAs, I'm not sure of exactly what you're quoting. We're obviously, at the end of the second quarter, our NPAs in the consumer side were 21.3, and they're down to 21 at the end of the third quarter, and we've seen a similar amount in commercial. I think as you look at the -- on the consumer side, obviously, the big thing that we're trying to do and that we've seen start up, is to work through the foreclosure pipeline and to get the foreclosure pipeline clear. And I would say on the commercial side, the only thing that we really saw of note during on the commercial side is that we did sell roughly $800 million during the quarter of a combination of criticized and nonperforming commercial real estate loans for the quarter. So that would have affected the number, but those are really the only 2 things that I would point to.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay. And then just a clarification. In terms of the TLGP debt that you said you had running off through the second quarter of next year, that $30 billion, does that include, is that -- does that include the $12 billion that you mentioned rolling off of the 90 days, or is that completely separate from that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">It's separate. We've got roughly $12 billion between now and the end of the year. And the TLGP number that I think the total number maturities in the second quarter of next year are roughly $30 billion, that's separate and distinct from the $12 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay. And then one final comment. There was a news report today, I guess, that came out on Bloomberg news talking about potentially moving some of the -- because of your downgrade that you mentioned in your prepared remarks, potentially moving some of the derivatives activity into the bank and out of some of the nonbank subsidiaries. Is there any additional color you can provide on that, given that it looks like from the regulatory data, most of the derivatives are already held, at least on a notional basis, already held in the bank?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Yes. I don't -- I mean, we were a little bit surprised at the article. I don't think that what's reflected in the article is anything different from the normal course of dealings that we've had with our counterparties since Merrill Lynch and BofA came together. And we, obviously, continue to work with them on transactions within all of our legal entities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And we'll go take our next question from Nancy Bush with NAB Research LLC.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Two questions. You had 2 quarters in a row now of significant special items and there is a fair amount of confusion on the Street, I think, about what the core trends are. I know that we're looking at fourth quarter and fourth quarter is always special, but can you tell us any large items that may be on the horizon right now coming in fourth quarter? And when would we get to quarters that sort of look more like normal and sustainable?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Well, I think if you, I mean, if you look at the adjustments and I think the things that are out there, the first thing I would say that we've seen is that you've seen, and you saw it in this quarter, a lot of pluses and minuses as it relates to asset disposition strategies and the like. And obviously, over the course of the last year and a half, as we've been working through those, it can lead to the numbers bouncing around. But Nancy, I'd ask you to go back to Page 18. And one of the reasons that we've been as focused as we have on the core and shedding assets, and you look at what we did with the private equity portfolio, is to start eliminating the chances that these types of both pluses and minuses come through. So we work -- from that perspective, we're just working with a lot smaller base than we've been. The second thing that I would say, that we've talked here to, are some of the things that affected net interest income. We obviously have spoken to where we are from a rate perspective, and to the extent that within a reasonable band of rates, we wouldn't expect those things to come through. The U.K. rate change, the way that it's set up will show up one quarter a year, and it's 1%. So you know what that is. And the last piece that's really where we're most focused, that's led to the majority of the noise is mortgage, and it was the reason that we split the business up between Legacy Asset Services, as well as the front end. We're working very hard to continue to work through the delinquent portfolio that we have and, obviously, we put a lot of reserves behind us. That being said, I think, given the questions that everyone asked today, there do continue to be some open items on mortgage. But we feel like we've done everything we can at this point.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Brian, a question for you. I mean, you've said over the past several quarters that before you went back to the regulators and tried to gain greater autonomy over capital management, that you had to \"do the work.\" And I'm wondering if you can just reflect on that right now and whether the majority of the work has been done and whether you're ready to make that request?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I think we continue to follow the capital plan, Nancy, and we're doing the work. And I think with the -- we will have to make sure that we continue to make the progress in the next several quarters, including with the -- the economy not being what anybody would have thought of 3 or 4 quarters ago. So we are in progress. We're off making progress in the capital plan, and we'll continue to do that. And as soon as we know something, we'll tell you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And we'll go next to Todd Hagerman with Sterne Agee.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee &amp; Leach Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Just a couple of quick questions. First just in terms of looking at the European exposure, 2 questions. One, I know France is not a big exposure for the company, but could you just remind us kind of what your relative position there is in France? Any other collateral that you have with respect to the GIPS that you outlined in the supplement? And whether or not there was any incremental marks taken in the course of the quarter as it relates to Europe?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yes, let me start, if I could, with what we've seen in the GIPS because a couple of pieces of information you can see this through some of our different disclosures, but let me just walk through it. As you think about where we are, our reported exposure for the quarter was roughly $14.6 billion that we have, and that was down roughly $1.5 billion quarter-over-quarter. As you think about that number, realize that, that number has been offset or reduced by roughly $2 billion through different CDS and short positions that we have. But when you start at that $14.6 billion, realize that there are certain things that we've hedged that don't show up there. The first is, and you can see in our supplement, we've got $1.7 billion of CVA hedges, largely against our Italian exposure. So as we think about sovereign exposure in Europe, we feel very good. In addition to that, we are not able to count our FVO hedges that we have on our fair option value book with the way we report for FICC. That reduces the exposure by about $2.2 billion. If you take those two adjustments and think about where we are, that gets that $14.6 billion number down by several billion dollars. And I think as we've said before, we got after this at the beginning of 2010, so there's nothing material from a P&amp;L perspective that you would have seen going through the income statement. If we move to France, what I would say there that we obviously do a lot -- not a lot in France, but we have a presence in France. I would say if you look at our exposure, we obviously have exposure to the clearinghouse there, which is pretty good exposure. The corporate lending that we do there, consistent with the strategy, is to multinationals that are not dependent within France. And then I would say, if you move to the counterparties and look at what we do with the different financial institutions there, it's a couple of billion dollars that we have out to the banks in the aggregate. And we manage that exposure very tightly, and manage it in a way where we don't have any real tall trees to any one institution. So I would say, as we look across not only to GIPS but also France and other countries that pop up, we feel very good about where we're positioned. And I think that the, as it relates to our book, we're more focused on -- is there a second derivative effect that comes out of what's going on in Europe as opposed to any concern with any of the exposures that we have.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee &amp; Leach Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay. And so just a follow-up on that. You say nothing material in terms of P&amp;L. I'm assuming less than that -- less than $500 million or so in the quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Much, much, much, much less than $500 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee &amp; Leach Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Much, much less. Okay. And then in terms of France, did you mention any sovereign-related debt?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">We do have some sovereign-related debt there. I think we, obviously, watch it very carefully. It's inconsistent with the way that we hedge. And what we've done in Italy, if you'd see any real change in the perception of the country, we would adjust that. But I think it's, despite some of the rumblings from the agencies, it still is a AAA-rated country.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee &amp; Leach Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay. And then if I could just switch gears quickly. In terms of FICC, and I know the preliminary draft of Volcker has just come out and it's a lot to digest, to say the least, but could you give us -- if I look at your trading inventory that you've disclosed, it came down a little bit this quarter. But I guess, one of the concerns from investors has been that has risen since the draft proposal, is really how it potentially might affect FICC for the commercial banks in particular. Any thoughts, preliminary thoughts, and just in terms of your business, again being levered towards FICC, and how that may change in the coming quarters, particularly as we think about the flow sale volume and inventory levels there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Yes. I'll make a couple of comments as you think about our FICC business. The first is that, since Merrill and BofA came together and you think about our FICC business, that the market shares that we have in the underwriting and distribution of securities that we've been consistently between #1 and #2. So the amount of -- given that position, what we do from the investor or from the issuer side and as a result, the need to make market from the investor side, I think, relative to others, we feel pretty good about where we are. Obviously, those regulations are still evolving. As I think others have said, the amount of compliance and regulatory costs that go along with that, while the cost may not be high, there's obviously a lot of work that will need to be done associated with those to ensure compliance, and we'll obviously work through those. But I think best that we can, given the nature of our business, at this point, at least, we'd not see a change materially.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee &amp; Leach Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay. So again, Europe aside and what happened this quarter, at least in the near term, we shouldn't expect any material change in terms of the business?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">That's correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And I show we have no further questions at this time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Thank you, everyone. We look forward to talking to you next quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect at this time.

Please go ahead, sir.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Kevin Stitt</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning. Before Brian Moynihan and Bruce Thompson begin their comments, let me remind you that this presentation does contain some forward-looking statements regarding both our financial condition and financial results, and that these statements involve certain risks that may cause actual results in the future to be different from our current expectations. These factors include, among other things, changes in economic conditions, changes in interest rates, competitive pressures within the financial services industry and legislative or regulatory requirements that may affect our businesses. And for additional factors, please see our press release and SEC documents.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">And with that, let me turn it over to Brian.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thanks, Kevin. Before Bruce begins, and good morning to everybody. Before Bruce begins his portion of the presentation on the slide, I thought I'd make a few comments about 2011 and what we are focused on for 2012. The last 2 years, we've been executing on a huge transformation here at Bank of America. After 6 large acquisitions in 6 years during the mid-2000s, then the economic crisis and its aftermath, we set on a course to simplify the company, to streamline the company, to reduce the size of the company, to lower our risk and build a fortress balance sheet. During that, we set goals to have 9% Basel I Tier 1 common and 6% tangible common at year-end 2011.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We set goals to reduce our non-core assets. We set goals to bring our credit risk down and to address the mortgage risk related to the Countrywide  acquisition. At the same time, we also set goals to continue to invest in areas where our company can grow and has its competitive advantage. Areas like our Wealth Management area, areas like our Preferred Small Business areas, where we've added Preferred Bankers and Small Business Bankers, areas like our Commercial Corporate and Investment Banking areas, especially in large corporate investment banking outside the United States.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Along the way, we had to address the issues that came up in mortgage; the slow recovering economy, which isn't moving -- which is moving forward but not as fast as we all like; the European crisis, a muted interest rate outlook and the revenue loss to the new regulations that have been passed. These then result in our focus on cost, and we announced late -- early last fall our New BAC program and the goals that we had for it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">So as we think about 2011, we saw the following. First, on capital and liquidity. This quarter, our Tier 1 common equity ratio ended at 9.86%. Our tangible common equity ratio ended at 6.64%. In the case of each of these ratios, they are dramatic improvement from the beginning of the year. And we made these improvements while absorbing significant mortgage-related costs during the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We have ratios that are in line with our peers, and we expect further improvement due to continued work on our balance sheet we'll make during 2012. In addition, our liquidity is and remains at record levels even after the downgrades we experienced in the fall. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Moving from capital and liquidity to our core businesses. On Slide 3, you can see, we continue to do what we're here for. We simply serve our clients and customers and we do it very well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Our core business activity continues to move forward. During 2011, we continue to grow our deposits and our investment assets for our corporate and personal customers. We originated 20% more in small business loans this year, in 2011, than we did in 2010. This met our internal goals we had for that unit, but importantly, also met our $1 billion incremental goal we committed to the White House and the Small Business Administration a few months back.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">For our commercial clients and our corporate clients, we did what we're here to do. We provided more loans, more capital and more market access here in the U.S. and around the world. For example, in the fourth quarter, you can see strong growth in our loan balances in our corporate area.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">And for our investor clients, we achieved the #1 Institutional Investor Overall Research ranking. Evidenced in the quality of ideas to match our capital to help them make their investments. In our Mortgage business, we continue to reshape our operations to focus solely on origination of mortgages for our customers and to do it well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">And importantly, we continue to help those who have difficulty making their payments in mortgages. We've now crossed over $1 million modified loans in our servicing portfolios. The third area we focus on, after capital liquidity and the core businesses, was costs. It's clear that we're going to grind forward with the recovery in this country. Our clients continue to push forward and we're seeing the activity continue to move forward, but a full recovery to what we would call normal may take some time. So with that in mind, we begin to focus on bringing our cost down across the company. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Our cost structure for Bank of America has 2 broad elements today. First, the cost we incur to deal with the mortgage issues. And second, the remaining cost to run the rest of the company for the benefit of our customers. Overall, cost were down from 2010 to 2011, and we expect substantial cost savings in 2012. This quarter, you can see that starting to take hold. We made significant progress towards our overall FTE reduction goals. Our period-end FTE is down about 7,000 people in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. This is over and above the 2,500 people we added in this quarter for our Legacy Asset Services. There's 2 things about this. One, this shows that our New BAC  implementation has begun in earnest. And second, the good news is, that we expect that LAS is at and near its peak staffing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">The fourth area we've been concentrating on in 2011 was trading. Trading was strong in the first part of the year, but with the issues in Europe, the down -- U.S. downgrades, the downgrades of our company and changes in client risk appetite, results were weak in the second half, especially in the third quarter. However, during the fourth quarter, we partially recovered as Bruce will talk about later. Yet, we still reduced risk during the quarter to ensure we were well positioned to handle what might have come up. We still have work to do in trading, but the team got active this quarter as the quarter unfolded, and we saw a stronger results.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">From a credit risk perspective, you can see that our charge-offs and cover ratios continued to improve. We ended the year with strong ratios. And we'll also end the year with $15.9 billion in rep and warranty liability reserves. We built significant litigation and other reserves in this area also. So the 4 areas of 2011 was all about raising capital and liquidity, driving the core businesses, managing the cost and risk management.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">As we look at 2012, these seems the same. First on capital and liquidity. Bruce will talk to you later about our targets as we look forward, but the focus in this company is to continue to move through the 10% level in Basel I Tier 1 common and drive towards a Basel III implementation. Liquidity will remain high, even as we continue to reduce our long-term debt footprint. And the second area is cost. As I said earlier, we expect that operating cost at LAS are nearing peak. As we finished the foreclosure look back and we continue to reduce the delinquent units serviced by this group, we expect its cost to come down during 2012. Just for clarity, in this quarter, in the fourth quarter of 2011, LAS costs were $3.5 billion of our total cost, $1.5 billion of that was litigation in LAS. The remaining were operating costs. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">For the rest of the company, we had expenses of about $16 billion in the fourth quarter, including $0.5 billion in goodwill write-downs. We expect to see in 2012 strong cost improvement consistent with our New BAC goals. Bruce will discuss these goals later.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">New BAC is doing what we expected, and the Phase 2 evaluation is going well. As you know, headcount drives our costs. We saw a significant improvement in the fourth quarter, and we expect to see that as we move through 2012.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">As we move to the core businesses in 2012, for 2012, we can now really focus on our retail strategy. In this quarter, you'll see the last part of the regulatory cost coming through, that's the Durbin interchange changes. We've now absorbed the Durbin, the Reg E, the CARD Act and all the changes that occurred over the last couple of years. The focus here in consumer is to balance our customer and shareholder return needs and to continue to work on our cost structure reducing branches as we've done this year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We're also going to continue to meet our customers' change of behaviors through our innovative offerings especially to our 9-million plus mobile banking consumers. Trading continue to improve this quarter as I said, and we have sized our business at times and we look forward to continue to improve in 2012.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">LAS and mortgage will continue to take work during 2012, which won't be different in 2011. But for the other businesses, we expect to generate strong core customer results. We also will continue to take advantage of the growth opportunities, garnering more customers and more depth in relationship with our consumers. That should continue to provide the good returns on capital that you see in those businesses this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">As you think about risks for 2012, we expect to see continued improvement in credit risk, as these legacy portfolios that we've identified for you continue to run off. Those legacy portfolios are a drag on earnings, with much higher credit cost than the rest of the portfolio that we'll retain and drive as we go forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We also expect in 2012 to continue to manage  through the mortgage issues, relying in part on our significant reserves we built in 2011. So as we look forward to 2012, the focus remains the same as the last 2 years: continue to drive capital and liquidity, continue to drive our core business growth where we have opportunities, continue to manage our cost well and continue to manage the legacy residual risk down.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">As we think about 2012, we begin with a much stronger position, stronger capital and liquidity, stronger reserves and that continues to give us optimism about the prospects for our franchise. And with 2012, with much great progress having been made on some of these legacy issues and the transformation of the last couple of years, we can take all the energy and talent we used  to drive that and dedicate it to help drive our company's success and we look forward to doing that. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">With that, I'll turn it over to Bruce</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Great. Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start my comments on Page 6 of the slide presentation. And as you all saw this morning, on an FTE basis, we reported net income of $2 billion or $0.15 a share during the fourth quarter of 2011. I'd like to bring your attention to several items in the quarter that had significant impacts on the income statement.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">First, in November, we sold the majority of the balance of our CCB shares, generating a gain of $2.9 billion. In addition to that, we exchanged trust preferred securities into a combination of senior notes and common stock during the quarter, which generated a pretax gain of $1.2 billion. And lastly, we had gains on sales of debt securities of approximately $1.2 billion in the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Things that went against us through the income statement during the quarter. The tightening of our credit spreads generated a DVA loss of $474 million relating to our trading liabilities. As Brian referenced, we had a goodwill impairment charge of $581 million that we recognized during the quarter that related to a change in the estimated value of the European Card business, and that's reported in All Other.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">During the quarter, we also had a credit mark on our structured liabilities under the fair value option that resulted in a negative mark of $814 million, as the result of our credit spreads tightening and that's reported in other income. As you think about that $814 million, keep in mind that whether positive or negative, it does not impact regulatory capital ratios but it does impact GAAP capital.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Lastly, from a litigation perspective, we had expense in the quarter of $1.8 billion, of which, $1.5 billion was mortgage related.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">If you flip to Slide 7, there are a lot of numbers on this page, but I'd like to bring your attention to a couple of things. The first, as you look from year-end 2010 to year-end 2011, you see a continued transformation of our balance sheet, where all of the focus is moving to our core client activities. A couple of things to highlight. Total assets, and I'm speaking from third quarter to fourth quarter now, total assets for the quarter were down 4% or approximately $90 billion. From a risk-weighted asset perspective, risk-weighted assets were down 6% or $75 billion during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">If we move down to Tier 1 common equity. Tier 1 common equity during the quarter increased $9 billion to $126.7 billion. That increase in Tier 1 common, along with the reduction in risk-weighted assets, led to our Tier 1 common equity ratio increasing from 8.65% to 9.86%. And I'll go into that in a little bit more detail in a few minutes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Tangible book value per common share was down 2%, reflecting the fact that we issued 400 million shares in the exchanges that I referenced with respect to trust preferred and preferred securities. You can see that 400 million shares in our outstanding common share change from the third quarter to the fourth quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">If you move to the bottom, our allowance for loan loss reserves came down $1.3 billion during the quarter as we released reserves. Importantly though, our allowance relative to annualized charge-offs improved from 1.7x to 2.1x at the end of the year. And lastly, our liability for representations and warranties remained relatively flat at approximately $16 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">If we move to Slide 8, I thought it was important to give you a walk-through of the drivers of the improvement in the Tier 1 common equity ratio. We start on the far left at 8.65%. As we've disclosed throughout the quarter, the preferred exchanges, the CCB sale of shares and the Canadian consumer card sale, in the aggregate, generated 60 basis points of Tier 1 common. Over and above that, 21 basis points coming from net income in change in deferred tax asset within the Global Markets business, about 18 basis points through reductions and market risk, change in loan balances and other asset sales were about 10 basis points. And you had a series of other things, both positives and negatives, that netted out to 12 basis points, which in the aggregate, increased the number to 9.86% at the end of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Moving from capital to liquidity. If you flip to Slide 9, you can see that our Global Excess Liquidity Sources increased from $363 billion at the end of the third quarter to $378 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. As you think about those excess liquidity sources, recall that, that does not include approximately $189 billion in additional liquidity that's available to our banking entities by pledging assets to the home loan banks in the Fed discount window.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">At the parent company, parent company liquidity was particularly strong at $125 billion, up $6 billion for the quarter. As you think about that increase, it's important to note that we accomplished that increase while reducing parent company debt by $17 billion during the fourth quarter. As a result of those changes, our time-to-required funding increased to 29 months at the end of the year, up from 27 months at the end of the third quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">That liquidity base, along with other funds that are available to us, will enable us to retire $60 billion of parent company unsecured debt that matures throughout 2012, about $24 billion of that is TLGP debt that will come due during the second quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">As you think about our issuance plans throughout 2012, from a plain vanilla debt perspective, you should expect us to be issuing less long-term debt in 2012 than we did in 2011.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">And similar to where we were at the end of the third quarter, our parent company and broker-dealers have no short-term unsecured debt outstanding.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We move from liquidity to net interest income, turning to Slide 10. Net interest income was $11 billion during the fourth quarter, up $220 million from the third quarter. The increase was driven by lower asset hedge ineffectiveness, as well as less acceleration of amortization of premiums on securities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On the positive side, contributions to net interest income from lower debt balances and rates paid on deposits were more than offset by portfolio repricing and reduction in consumer loan balances, including the sale of the Canadian Card business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We'd ask you to keep in mind here that our asset liability management strategy is focused on managing interest rate risk across the entire corporation, which includes minimizing OCI exposure and managing the duration of our securities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Moving to Slide 11, on Deposits. We highlight the results of our Deposits business. Earnings for the quarter were $141 million, a decrease from the third quarter, primarily driven by an increase in FDIC expense, which we would expect to come down going forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Average deposit balances decreased 1% compared to the third quarter, driven primarily by a decline in time deposits, which we had targeted to do during the quarter and we'll continue to do so.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">During the quarter, rates paid on deposits declined from 25 basis points to 23 basis points. As we continue to focus on the cost and optimize our delivery network, you can see our branch count came down again during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We have continued to expand our service for small business owners by hiring over 500 locally-based small business bankers during the year to provide convenient access to financial advice and solutions to our customers. We've also continued to increase our mobile banking customer base to 9.2 million customers, which is a 7% increase from the prior quarter and up 45% from a year ago.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">If we turn to Slide 12, Cards Services earnings decreased from the third quarter to $1 billion, primarily due to the impact of the Durbin Amendment, which kicked in during the fourth quarter. Credit card purchase volumes did increase by 6% from a year ago after adjusting for portfolio divestitures and were up seasonally from the third quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Within our U.S. Card business, new account growth was up more than 50% from the fourth quarter a year ago. Within Card Services, ending loans declined $1.6 billion from the third quarter due largely to portfolio divestitures and continued non-core portfolio runoff, that was partially offset by the increase in volume-related seasonal spend.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Credit quality within the Card business continues to improve. U.S. credit card losses improved for the ninth consecutive quarter, and our 30-plus day delinquency rate declined for the 11th consecutive quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">As you look at the Card business, I want to remind you that the International Card Business results were moved to All Other in the third quarter and prior-period results were adjusted accordingly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Within Global Wealth and Investment Management on Slide 13. Earnings for the quarter of $249 million were down from the third quarter as lower market levels and activity drove lower revenue, and expenses were higher due to a few noisy items. Client balances were up 3.5% from the third quarter due to fourth quarter market levels, as well as AUM flows.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Long-term AUM flows were $4.5 billion during the fourth quarter, pretty much in line with what we saw during the third quarter. On the expense side, as I mentioned, there were several items including higher FDIC and litigation expenses, as well as other related losses and some severance costs that we saw during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We added 214 Financial Advisors to the world's leading advisory force during the quarter, with total FA levels exceeding 17,300 at the end of the year. As we look forward, we would expect unit advisor growth in 2012 based on economic conditions, as well as absorbing the FA growth from 2011.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Net income in Commercial Banking on Slide 14 was flat at $1 billion since the third quarter. Commercial clients continued to increase liquidity positions, driving average deposit levels up $2.2 billion from the third quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Average loans were flat as the reductions that we saw within our Commercial Real Estate area were offset by about $1.7 billion of loan growth within the C&amp;I category. Asset quality continued to improve, net charge-offs were down $83 million, nonperforming assets were down $1 billion to $5.6 billion and our reservable utilized criticized exposure declined by 11% during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">If we switch to our Global Banking and Markets area on Slide 15, the results reflected increased sales and trading activity, excluding DVA, which I'll cover in greater detail in a minute.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Average loan and lease balances during the quarter increased $10.5 billion or 9%, primarily driven by growth in domestic and international corporate loans, as well as international trade finance. While deposit balances were down 5% versus the linked quarter, I would highlight that our ending deposits at the end of the year were up nicely as we saw good flows during the last half of the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">If you turn to Slide 16, I'd ask you to look in the middle of the page, where we've drawn a red box around our sales and trading area. Sales and trading, excluding DVA, was at $1.9 billion or up 73% from what was a difficult third quarter, driven primarily by our Fixed Income Currency and Commodity area due to less volatility, a tightening spread environment and a reduction in the CVA, although these are still at relatively elevated levels. Within our FICC business excluding DVA, credit products, structured credit trading in rates and currencies drove much of the increase. In equities, once again, excluding DVA, results decreased by 16% primarily due to lower volumes in commission-related revenue.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We did record DVA losses as I highlighted upfront, of $474 million in the quarter, as our credit spreads tightened compared to gains of $1.7 billion that we saw during the third quarter. On the Investment Banking side, firm-wide Investment Banking fees, excluding self-led fees were $1 billion, up 8% from the third quarter of 2011. We would also note here that we maintained our #2 ranking globally in net investment banking fees, while gaining share during the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">If we turn to Slide 17, Consumer Real Estate Services reported a loss of $1.5 billion, driven by continued elevated credit cost in the Home Equity portfolio, higher litigation cost and the cost of managing delinquent and defaulted loans in the servicing portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">The Home Loans business within the CRES area had a slight profit for the quarter. First mortgage  production of $22 billion was down from the third quarter due primarily to our exit from the correspondent channel, which we spoke of during the last quarter's earnings call.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">As a result of this, core production income declined during -- relative to the third quarter of 2011. Results for the quarter did include $263 million in cost for reps and warrants primarily related to the GSEs, along with the $1.5 billion of litigation expense I touched on at the beginning of the presentation. Our MSR asset decreased by approximately $500 million during the quarter, driven by MSR sales and borrower payments and ended the quarter at $7.4 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">MSR results net of hedge were positive by approximately $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter. As we look at the cap rate on the MSR, we ended the period at 54 basis points versus 52 basis points in the third quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">On Slide 18, we show some comparisons of certain metrics in the Legacy Asset Servicing area on a linked quarter basis and compared to the prior year quarter, as we continue to work very hard to reduce delinquent loans and find homeowner solutions. As Brian referenced, we are either at or near the peak of staffing this area and we are making very good progress.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Total Legacy Asset Services first-lien servicing dropped 16% in the quarter, while 60-day plus delinquent loans dropped 8%. Much of the work done to sell MSRs has allowed the transfer of more than 510,000 loans serviced in the past quarter alone.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">As we look at this page, it's obviously very important that we continue to shrink the activity that we have in the Legacy Asset Servicing area, so that we can, again, attacking the $2 billion of expenses that Brian alluded to at the beginning</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">On Slide 19, we show you the results of All Other which, recall, includes our Global Principal Investing business, the International Consumer Card business, strategic investments, our discretionary portfolio associated with interest rate protection and the discontinued real estate portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Items of note in the quarter in All Other, included $814 million related to the negative fair value adjustments on structured liabilities, the $581 million goodwill impairment charge related to European Card, $2.9 billion related to CCB, $1.2  billion on the exchanges and $1.1 billion related to the sale of debt securities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">As we move and split to Slide 20. A lot of line items and data, but I would highlight a couple of things here. We did make very good progress across most categories of expense. If you start at the top line, you can see that our personnel expense did come down in the quarter, largely driven by a 7,000 reduction in FTE headcount from approximately 288,000 to 281,000. Those benefits were somewhat muted in the quarter due to higher default servicing cost and an increase in severance costs associated with the headcount reductions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">You can see in the majority of the other line items that we did continue to reduce costs, with several exceptions. The first, in other general operating expense, which increased $1.6 billion, that increase was due solely to an increase of $1.3 billion in litigation, as well as elevated FDIC expense, which we would expect to go down in 2012.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">The other 2 items of note, the $581 million goodwill impairment for the European Consumer Card business and our professional fees, which tend to be seasonally high during the fourth quarter of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">We turn to Slide 21. Let me update you with where we are with respect to our New BAC program. We completed the initial planning related to Phase 1 in the third quarter of '11, and began the implementation during the fourth quarter. Under our original guidance, we have a goal of achieving approximately $5 billion in cost savings or about 18% of the expenses associated with the areas addressed.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">We stated earlier that we were aiming for 20% of the $5 billion to be achieved during 2012. Based on the hard work done to date, we now believe we will exceed that 2012 goal.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Phase 2 evaluations for the areas outlined on Page 21 began late in 2011, and we would expect to complete that work in April. As we look at the expense base, it's similar to Phase 1, but we would expect lower cost savings given that the businesses tend to be more efficient already and have lower headcount. While the savings will be lower, we do think, however, that we will start being able to see some of those saves later this year, as the initiatives to achieve the savings aren't as inter-dependent as the consumer businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So if we take a step-back and look at the lower headcount from the third quarter and combined that with New BAC, both Phase 1 and Phase 2, along with an improving mortgage environment, we believe we can realize substantial cost savings in the second half of this year. We're not going to identify a specific number on this call, but we'll update you as we move further into the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">If we now move to credit trends that we saw during the quarter on Slide 22. You can see that overall consumer trends remained positive. Net charge-offs, 30-plus performing delinquencies and nonperforming assets all continued to fall. Net charge-offs in the credit card area declined more than any other portfolio due in part to recoveries recorded to the bulk sale of previously charged off U.K. credit card loans. Provision expense within consumer was $3.2 billion and included a $384 million reduction in reserves.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">On Slide 23, you can see that residential mortgage in home equity 30- to 89-day performing delinquent loans, excluding our fully insured loans, were relatively flat with the third quarter. This was not unexpected as the fourth quarter has historically had slow collections.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">On Slide 24, we show nonperforming asset trends for both our Residential Mortgage and Home Equity area. Total consumer real estate nonperformers trended down for the sixth quarter in a row. Residential Mortgage declined from the third quarter as charge-offs, pay downs and returns to performing status continue to outpace new nonaccrual loans. Home Equity loans did show a slight increase, as inflows outpaced charge-offs and returned to performing status.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">The increase in NPAs was driven by growth in the greater than 180-day past due loans, while the less than 180-day past due loans remained flat as delinquency inflows remained relatively stable quarter-over-quarter. As you may recall, loans greater than 180 days past due have already been written down to their net realizable value. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Turning to overall commercial credit quality on Slide 25. The trends that we saw were very similar to what I referenced when I discussed the commercial bank. Including the provision for unfunded commitments, we recorded a benefit provision expense of $220 million that included a reserve reduction of $736 million. Both nonperforming assets and reservable criticized levels continued to decrease.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">We flip to Slide 26. We've included a slide on Basel III that we included when we reported our second quarter earnings, and I would make a couple of points here. The first is, we continue to work very hard as we work toward and progressed towards Basel III at the end of 2012. You can see that significant progress in 2 different ways. The first, we had originally targeted getting our risk-weighted assets under Basel III down to $1.8 trillion by the end of 2012. We have updated that goal now to have risk-weighted assets down to $1.75 trillion. In addition to the reduction of risk-weighted assets based on the progress that we made during the quarter, we now expect our Tier 1 common equity ratio under Basel III at the end of 2012, on a fully phased-in basis, to be between 7.25% and 7.5%, up from our previous guidance of 6.75% to 7%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Let me now wrap up by spending a few moments discussing our expectations for 2012. I won't go into a lot of detail as the economic landscape is somewhat uncertain, given the evolving events in Europe, the upcoming elections and the speed around the recovery in the housing markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">In 2012, we believe net interest income will remain somewhat challenged and will be highly dependent on the rate environment. While we expect consumer loans to continue to run off, this should be somewhat mitigated by loan growth in our commercial businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Additionally, we expect to benefit from continued reductions in the term debt footprint. Most of the line items in our earnings report, whether it be card income, service charges, investment or brokerage, tend to be very correlated with the economy. So if we see economic growth, we would expect that to translate into higher revenues.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">At this point, Durbin is fully embedded in the fourth quarter results, so you have a solid base to work with there. Investment banking, we would expect the activities in 2012 to be fairly consistent with what we saw in 2011.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">As Brian referenced at the beginning, we'd expect to see better results in sales and trading. But once again, those tend to be pretty correlated to global market conditions and the health of the recovery. Equity investment income, we'd expect to drop off considerably given the sale of the CCB shares that we have during 2011.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">On the expense side, in the first quarter, we should start to see the positive impact of the fourth quarter headcount reduction and the impact from New BAC.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Our goal for the fourth quarter of this year is to have sustainable cost savings, which would include not only certain New BAC Phase I and Phase 2 benefits, but also lower expenses in LAS, the benefits of reduced merger charges, lower cost associated with businesses we've exited, as well as other expense reduction initiatives.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Credit quality should continue to improve over the next few quarters, but at somewhat of a slower pace, and we'd also expect to continue to see some reserve reductions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Capital and capital ratios should continue to grow. What will drive that growth in 2012 will be mainly through earnings and to a lesser extent, RWA levels throughout the year. We expect that most sales of business units are essentially complete, although there will be some targeted areas --  some targeted activity within certain selected areas. We expect the effective tax rate to be around 30%, plus or minus, depending on any unusual items. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So in summary, as we enter 2012, we expect the economic headwinds and low interest rates to persist, while we continue to deal with legacy mortgage issues and ongoing regulatory changes. That being said, we enter 2012 with higher capital, liquidity and combined reserves for credit, representations and warranties and litigation than at any point in the company's history.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And with that, why don't we go ahead and open up the line for questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p9\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Mike Mayo with CLSA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Can you talk about the commercial loan growth and how much is due to drawdown of existing credit lines versus expansion in new areas?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Let me just hit a couple of points. One of the things we traditionally talked about, Mike, is our core middle market because people look at that as a market for what middle market companies are doing in the draw rate. It is relatively consistent, third quarter or fourth quarter, 32%, down 100 basis points from a year ago, I think, round numbers, and down maybe 800 or 900 basis points from where it would sit in a normalized economies. So middle market companies are consistently drawing but haven't moved. At the larger corporate area, we had some strong growth in the fourth quarter, I'll have Bruce touch on that. But from a broad economy, people are fairly stable and sitting there. Bruce, why don't you touch in the higher?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Sure. If you look at, particularly, within the GBAM space, I would make a couple of observations. We saw a growth in both regular way corporate loans, as well as in the trade finance area, so the growth that we saw was fairly widespread. If you look at that growth by region, we saw some growth in the U.S. and Canada, and we also saw a very nice growth in both the Latin America, as well as the Asia-Pac region. In addition to that, we also saw some growth within our Mortgage area, within the Global Banking and Markets area. So not any one thing driving the growth. I'd say the one area that was probably the strongest was trade finance but it was fairly widespread throughout the business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Mike, just one last observation. If you think about the capital-markets driven activity in the higher grade stuff, it's been very strong and investment -- non-investment grade comes in and out freely on the markets. But I'd say, when I talk to sponsors and other people, they're ready to go and for deals, $4-billion, $5-billion transaction. There's a very strong demand to do them from the sponsor side. So I think if market stay stable, we could see some pretty good activity this year on that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Just one separate and last question. For new project BAC, are you cutting enough? I guess, if you look at results for last year, revenues reported were down $17 billion, expenses were down $3 billion. So a big gap between the decline in revenues and decline in expenses. And you can back out LAS and some other items, it's still seem to be a pretty big negative gap. So are you cutting as much as you need to? You have the structural project but perhaps more cutting for this cycle, is that needed?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Well, as we're approaching the business, which are more cyclical, i.e., the trading businesses, investment banking. You've seen in the press that we've been, in advance, even doing the work in New BAC. We reduced headcount fairly significantly in some of those areas, where the opportunities weren't there and that's more adjusting that business cost 2 ways. One is the comp cost, you adjust down obviously; then secondly, the headcount. So that's been going on. I'd say, you need to be -- just to remind you and you know this, Mike, is that in the -- there's negative revenue, rep and warranty cost has actually negative revenues, so that has a fairly big impact. But as we look at it, we are driving towards the right cost structure for the right run rate of revenues for this company over time, we'll continue to drive at that. You could always say, \"Can I go a little faster, go a little slower?\" But we need to balance, especially in the broad consumer business. You need to have good customer service, strong customer relationships and we continue to invest in the growth areas, with getting the cost down. So example, on the branches, you've seen the numbers, we dropped to 5,700 from a high of 6,100. Our cost of operating our whole retail platform as a percent of deposits continues to work down. But we have to be careful to make sure the service quality as we do that is well-managed. So it's a balancing act. I question every day whether we get it exactly right, can it go a little faster, a little slower. But the areas are really market sensitive, we move pretty quickly on cost. The other areas, you have to be careful and reengineer the works so you make sure they can still do a great job for the customers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We'll take our next question from John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Bruce, I was wondering on net interest income. Was there still some level of after-hedge ineffectiveness and prepay amortization in the fourth quarter number? I know it was less than third but was there something in the fourth?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">There was, John. And I think if you look at the delta in net interest income, really, 4 main items I'll give you a little bit more detail on. We picked up $500 million of benefit during the quarter from less hedging effectiveness in prepays. We picked up $200 million of deposit based on lower debt footprint and our deposit pricing. On the negative side, we had about $200 million less because of the rates on our mortgage portfolio and about $200 million less due to the lower Consumer Card businesses, primarily credit card, which included the sale of Canadian Card that we didn't have in December. So if you take those for 4 items, that'll give you the bridge, the change in net interest income for the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And do you think that you can grow net interest income from that level of $11 billion in the fourth quarter going forward? What's going to be the drivers?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I think, right now, if you look at what we've seen during the third and the fourth quarter, that that's reflective of the balance sheet and the rate structure today. And I think as you look forward, the only things that are going to change those numbers going forward are primarily a change in interest rates, and to the extent that we see a meaningful change in loan demand. But as we look into 2012, I think that the third and the fourth quarter should give you the best jumping off point realizing that there was still some hedging effectiveness in FAS 91 in us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. So that's a good run rate and from there, it depends on whether rates rise and when the loan growth picks up?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">That's correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. Similarly, on expenses, when we look at the Page 20, lots of details there. I'm trying to just get a sense of what the run rate might be going into the first quarter. Taking up some of these specials, it looks like, maybe something similar last quarter, $17.2 billion to $17.4 billion, something like that. I know you don't want to get too specific. But can you give us any kind of sense of where you might be entering the year with the expense base. I know you don't want to get specific about your targets, but where are you going to start off?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes. I mean, I think that if you look at the recent quarters, it bounces around a little bit based on GBAM revenues, GBAM performance, compensation and other things flowing through. As well as to the extent that there's severance or other things bouncing around. But I think $17 billion area without any kind of onetime or anything going through it, is probably the right starting point to think about, John.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. And then from there, you expect to get the benefits in the second half from some of the LAS and the New BAC stuff, so that should improve later on in the year from that base?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes. And, John, remember in that $17-billion type of number, we're not -- Bruce is not eliminating the $2 billion as sort of core LAS operating cost. So we expect to see that come down. And as I said in my comments, that come down in core run rate. But we have to do this right and that's where we keep engineering the change quarter by quarter by quarter. The headcount reduction this quarter was part of the startup.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And, John, the only other thing I just want to make sure we highlight is, as we do each year in each first quarter, we have the vesting of the stock compensation expense during the first quarter. And recall that, that was about $1 billion during the first quarter of '11. So I just don't want you to be surprised when you see that in the first quarter of '12.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. And you are including that when you said $17 billion?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">That's correct. I'm not including that in the $17 billion, that's correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. Last thing for me just on the rep and warrant issue, Bruce. Where do we stand on the changing GSE behavior? Is it more predictable? What was the nature of request and denials that you got this quarter on the GSE front? And do you have a sense of how much of the GSE clients you've addressed?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes. I think, if you go back and look at the disclosure we have back in the slide, I would say at this point, we highlighted it in the third quarter that there were some disagreements between the 2 parties, and I would say that there's really been no change in that perspective during the fourth. And you can see that the GSE unsolved balance went up a little bit during the quarter and quite frankly, that wasn't unexpected.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And we'll take our next question from Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets &amp; Co., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">The $1.5 million litigation expense this quarter, and I know you guys have been putting a lot of money away for litigation. But is this related to the AG settlement? Or is it just other various suits out there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">What it relates to, it say there, there are 2 significant items that we had included. I'm not going to quantify them. You saw that we did have the fair lending settlement at legacy Countrywide prior to when Bank of America bought Countrywide, that went through during the quarter. In the second thing, you're correct. During the fourth quarter, while there's no DOJ-AG settlement, you read what we read and we adjusted our litigation expense, as well as our reserve levels to reflect the best that we could, our understanding of what the deal may be.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets &amp; Co., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. And second question is asset quality. Charge-offs dropped $1 billion in the quarter, which I thought was a very good number. Was there some internal change? Are you pushing loans more through? Or are you just working loans out better? I mean, is there anything, any color around that number?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Two things. The first is, and I referenced is, recall, that we did settle during the quarter some of the loans in the U.K. that were written off. We did a little bit better than we could have expected, and that was about $300 million of the improvement. So we did have that onetime pop or onetime benefit. But I would say that across-the-board, on the consumer side, we adjusted the underwriting standards back in the fourth quarter of '08 and the first quarter of '09, and we're starting to see the benefits from those standards as the old stuff has flown through and the new stuff is becoming a greater percentage of the portfolio. And then on the commercial side, I would say across-the-board, credit quality within the commercial space continues to be very strong. And we continue to feel very good about commercial credit going forward. And the last thing I'd say is that, we've obviously reduced the size of the commercial real estate and clearly think we're on the other side of the commercial real estate charge-offs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And we'll go next to Glenn Schorr with Nomura.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">A couple of quickies. You mentioned in the outlook commentary that you think you could beat the 20% achieved for Phase 1. I'm just curious, bigger than a breadbox, is that a lot more than the 20%, a little bit more than the 20% and maybe where you're seeing the acceleration of that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">It was a constant focus, really, when it comes to accelerate anything we can that really isn't dependent on technology implementation. So when you look at the broad -- in 2012, we'll spend $0.75 billion to get the cost saves type of numbers, so we're trying to accelerate the non-technology-dependent, and that's the reference we gave you. So we're ahead of schedule, and we expect to stay ahead of schedule. And overall, the numbers will come in -- the goals we gave you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay, that's fine. Curious on what you have baked in to both your credit loss assumptions and your reserves in terms of housing outlook. There's been some in the industry talking about it bottoming. There's economic data that's getting better. There's affordability metrics that are getting better, but you still have the stress inventory, the underwriting standards, and the securitization markets are kind of frozen. Just general thoughts on housing bottoming and how you're positioned?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Sure, 2 things. The first on just credit across the company. What I would expect, and just to make sure that we're clear, we would expect charge-offs to continue to improve during 2012. And at the same time, you're probably likely to see reserve releases slow down. So from a net perspective, the jumping-off point at the fourth quarter is a pretty good jumping-off point as you think about credit for 2012. With respect to the housing piece of it, we look at and look out at macro markets and look at what the expectations are there as we look at forecasting and looking at residential real estate. Those basically show a flat market throughout 2012. And as we project through 2012, we don't really assume any significant move up or down. It's basically flat.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">From a pure activity [ph] standpoint, we continue to see -- when we get hold of our property, we continue to see to be able to move it in 60, 90 days, and the activity is moving through the markets as the foreclosure rework was done and any activity. So we don't try to outguess the market. We resort to the average, and we adjust it for the places we have more loans. But the reality is you continue to see the healing in the housing market every day in terms of the amount of activity, the amount of delinquencies in the process moving forward. And so I think it's still a lot of hard work, but you'll be seeing it move forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Appreciate that. Sticking with the housing theme, just curious if there's any update on the private label potential settlement and just maybe where are we in those conversations and maybe what's the next event, timing-wise.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Really no change with anything that you see out there, which I think we're expecting to see by the end of February, the venue that the case will be decided. And basically, what you see out there is the same thing that we see, and our sense is we'll get [ph] a little bit better sense with where the venue is by the end of February.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And is it Delaware versus New York? Is that the battle line?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">State versus federal.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">State and federal, sorry. They got bumped up. That's right.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yes, the decision's in the Second Circuit. Our expectation is somewhere in the next 45 days or so. They'll make a decision whether state and the federal court or go to state court.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay, last quickie is in the summary slide, you showed $5.6 billion of pretax pre-provision, but that's before a lot of all these one-timers. There's a lot of moving parts, but curious if you have a thought on what a clean jumping-off point is for pretax pre-provision going into '12 as we factor in your thoughts on expenses and we can make our own choices on the market.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I mean, I think what I'd say is that the cleanest way to think about it is if you take the $5.6 billion and you adjust for the items that are down below, you get to a number that's in and around $4 billion. And as we look forward and as we look to build off of that $4 billion, you've obviously got a series of things that we'd look at going forward. We clearly would expect the trading and investment banking revenues to be better in 2012 than what we saw here. We've obviously got New BAC Phase 1 that's beginning to kick in during 2012. As we've talked about, New BAC 2 will kick in quicker than 1, probably towards the end of the year. You've got improvements towards the end of the year in the Legacy Asset Services cost, and then you've got any improvement that we see from the rate environment. So I think as you look at those numbers, that's probably the best jumping-off point, and we're obviously working hard to drive those improvements with the categories that I just went through.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And we'll go next to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">A couple of questions, one on the housing. In the past, you have given a P&amp;L hit of a 1% or 5% decline in home prices. I realize that your outlook is for stable. But given some of the changes that you've done in your business and asset sales, et cetera, I'm wondering how that number is -- that P&amp;L hit has changed?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">If we look at -- it hasn't changed that much, Betsy. Right now, we're looking at 1% hit, being about $450 million. That's comprised between $125 million and $150 million in our purchase credit impaired portfolio, about $200 million through reps and warrants and about $125 million through the property values that get refreshed each quarter would be the way I'd think about it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. And then you also gave a data point here on the servicing book and 8% decline in delinquent loan service. Can you give us an update on what portion of the total servicing book is delinquent?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">If you -- we can get to that. It's in the detail. I'll have Lee call you with it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. And then last on severance. Did you break out what the severance dollars were in the quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">We did not, but I can give those to you. We had about $186 million of severance during the third quarter, and that jumped up to about $239 million during the fourth quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. And that was split between the different business lines, or how would I segment that between the business lines?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Split between the business lines. The most significant piece you're going to see there is within the Global Banking and Markets area.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">We'll go next to Brennan Hawken with UBS.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So I was just hoping to get some more granular color on the improved Basel III guidance. Is the driver of that improvement there mostly the numerator improvement we saw this quarter? And can you give some color maybe on the contribution from an expansion in the RWA mitigation plan that you highlighted? Any chance for more detail there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Sure. I mean, I think if you think about -- and the way that I would think about it is that there a lot of pluses and minuses, but if you go to Page 7, where we show you the balance sheet data, we show you that Tier 1 common equity has gone up by about $9 billion during the quarter. And in addition to that, we've changed our guidance on the risk-weighted assets side by about $50 billion. So I think if you take those 2 changes, realize we would have had some increase in our common equity in our original numbers flowing through the income statement, that if you look at those 2 line items and think about that in the context of $1.75 trillion to $1.8 trillion, those are going to get you to about the 50 basis point increase in the guidance that we've given.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. And then thinking about monoline exposure and the capital relief that we saw from another firm announcing a settlement, when you sort of back in the risk weights there, it implies maybe 600% to 700% risk weight for monoline exposure. Would that -- Is it right to think about that sort of a risk weight for you guys? Do you get a similar risk rate when you think about your monoline exposure? And is that exposure limited to the $1.9 billion that you disclosed in the last Q plus the $0.5 billion in CVA?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I think I can't speak to it. I saw the Morgan Stanley disclosure, but I think you're referencing -- I can't speak to exactly how they're doing it. What I can say is that if you look in our supplemental package, we show a breakout of our monoline exposure. We did take a couple hundred million dollars in the quarter of hits through the banking and markets area for monoline exposure. And you can see at the end of the year, I believe back in the supplemental page, we show ourselves at about $1.3 billion of net exposure from a monoline perspective after CVA. And once again, we did take a couple hundred million dollars of expense during the fourth quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">But is it right to think about it a risk weight that would be in the neighborhood of 700% on that exposure for Basel III?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Probably a little bit higher than that, quite frankly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">But one thing is -- remember the difference between our capital base size-wise and other people's capital base is one of the different effects here. We're dealing with $120 billion of Tier 1 common, so it's just a different type of number.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Right. Proportionally different piece of the puzzle.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Exactly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">We'll take our next question from Jefferson Harralson with KBW.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Jefferson Harralson - Keefe, Bruyette, &amp; Woods, Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I was going to follow up on that kind of line of thought. When you think about the total risk-weighted asset shrinking $172 billion year-over-year or $75 billion quarter-to-quarter, can you just talk about kind of what that is and what revenues are associated with that decline?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Sure. Let's go to the fourth quarter. I think it's probably the best place to start. And if you start on Page 8, let's just go through the individual items to give you a sense. The preferred exchanges, while we put the shares out there, there'll be a nominal P&amp;L effect by virtue of having lower interest expense and lower preferred dividends. The CCB sale during the fourth quarter as well as the one that we did in the third quarter, there've been some things written out there publicly about the impact that that's over $700 million of a loss of revenues that go through. And I think when you think about CCB, you have to think about the offset to that, which is, by virtue of doing that, there was over $14 billion of liquidity that came into the parent company that basically will offset, from an interest expense perspective, the loss in preferred dividends that we would have had through that business. You move over to Canadian Card, while the business clearly had PPNR associated with it, once you get down to the bottom line, from a net income perspective, the net income contribution of the Canadian Card business was nominal. You continue to move through the right-hand side of the page, net income and DTA is what it is. The reductions in market risk, as you think about those reductions in market risk and work through that, roughly 2/3 of that reduction in market risk were certain assets that were legacy and other securitization-type assets that we had targeted to sell that, from a net income perspective, didn't contribute that much. About 1/3 of the 21 -- or excuse me, 1/3 of the 18 basis points in market risk would have been VaR and other things that tend to ebb and flow with market activity. So to the extent that the markets get better in 2012, there could be 5 to 10 basis points that comes back on there. And quite frankly, we would welcome that because it would be suggestive of the markets getting better. You then move over to the asset sales and changes in loans on a net basis. The biggest piece of that is our runoff portfolio within the consumer businesses. And the contribution from that runoff portfolio, once again, is very nominal. And then lastly, you move over to 12 basis points of the other, some of that is mono-related, some of it's measurement-related. And I think some of it is just, quite frankly, us doing a better job as it relates to how we approach Basel I measurement, and there were some offsets on the other side. So as you go through this, the impact and to say that we're going to see any meaningful change in income based on what we did in the fourth quarter, we just don't see that. Recognizing that to the extent that the capital markets and the global markets come back, you may see a little bit of a bump up there. But other than that, these are good numbers, and there shouldn't be a significant revenue impact outside of what I just talked about.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Just to make sure -- there's revenue impacts, but after charge-offs that lies before you, there's no bottom line. And that's the thing, I think, it's not been cleared to the people, and so hopefully, Bruce has clarified that one.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">We'll go next to the side of Nancy Bush with NAB Research, LLC.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">The settlement with the AGs, which, once again, is rumored to be near, Brian, in your view, does this mark some -- if we get this, will this mark some kind of watershed event that will lead to sort of a quickening of the pace of the resolution of other issues out there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Well, I think in the work that's gone on to develop that settlement. You had the major servicers and then, obviously, the representatives of the Department of Justice, then the state AGs and HUD and others work together to come up with a package of programs that we believe will be very positive in pushing the situation forward. So I think you're right. In hindsight, we'll decide whether it's watershed or not years from now, but I think the intent of those programs is to actually help drive the recovery in housing and how to handle customers. So I think that, combined with all the other programs and the million modifications we've done, that combined with -- whether you agree housing is up or down, but the general stability and, frankly, the passage of time and working through it, I think these are good things. And that's why we wanted to -- we and the rest of the industry have been trying to work this out, really, to provide that catalyst to keep pushing the mortgage situation forward. So I think you're exactly right, Nancy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Well, then part B of that, if we get the settlement and things start to resolve, then does profitability at your company sort of go on some kind of stairstep move up? Is there going to be some dramatic move upward as the housing issues get worked out? I mean, are legacy costs going to come down that quickly, lessening of litigation reserves, et cetera, et cetera? I mean, is there going to be some point at which there is a big change in profitability of Bank of America?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Well, I mean, if you just -- the question is how fast does it come through because just to implement the settlement and the work will take a series of months and quarters. But I think the theme is exactly right. If you think about the drag in 2011, we made a few billion dollars in the fourth quarter. We had a $1.5 billion loss in our Consumer Real Estate business. For the year, we made $1 billion plus, and we had substantial losses in the real estate business, as you can see. So if you take those losses out, the core run rate of the company is embedded and is running every quarter. The business we have there performing are driving profit. And this has been a huge, huge drag to this company, both from expense side and on the charge-off side and everything else. So it will come that way. I just caution you, Nancy, to realize that this a lot of work, a lot of people and a lot of -- particularly difficult because of what's involved and people and their homes and stuff that we got to work it right. So I'll just caution on the speed, but the principle is right.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay. And just a question for you, Bruce. You mentioned a reduction in FDIC expenses in 2012. Can you quantify that or just give us some color about what the expenses were in 4Q and how they should step down?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Yes. I would think about it as we got through the fourth quarter, there was a true-up, and as we go forward, we'd expect that expense to be down a couple hundred million dollars in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And we'll go next to Ed Najarian with ISI Group.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Edward R. Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">You talked about the LAS costs coming down. When you broke that $3.5 billion down into sort of $1.5 billion of litigation and $2 billion core, can you give us any sense of what you think sort of a long-term run rate or normalized level is for that $2 billion core? I know you're probably reluctant to talk about the timing of getting there, but when you do get there, maybe even few years away, what would be the right number to think about that $2 billion going to?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">So I think, Ed, to frame that, think about the 60-plus delinquent units and the progress we made this year and the progress we ultimately got to get to to get to more normalized level, that will take the next 6 to 8 quarters to get through that. But when you get down to that level, the number should be more in the $300 million a quarter versus $2 billion from the operating cost side. And so a reasonable amount to service those loans even under the heightened servicing duties that will be embedded in the way you service delinquent loans going forward is that kind of number. I just again say it's going to take us time to work through that. You see the progress we've made this year. You see the flows coming in slowing because -- on the whole servicing portfolio in terms of improving delinquency and then moving the stuff through the process. So I think that's what we should be looking for, from a $2 billion down to maybe a $300 million a quarter type of number.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Edward R. Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay, that's helpful. And then second question would be on interest-bearing deposits. Unlike other banks, we saw pretty big step down in interest-bearing deposits. I know some of that was probably intentional CD runoff, but it really happened in most deposit categories. Any color on that? And in your mind, did that have anything to do with sort of the snafu around the charge related to debit cards that you then took back?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Let's start from the broad strokes. We saw an elevated level of account closings in the quarter, elevated from last year fourth quarter, but frankly, by, I'd say, 20% versus last year fourth quarter '10 to '11. But from '09, it's actually still down in the fourth quarter of '11 versus fourth quarter of '09 by 20-odd percent. So you saw that, so there's no question, and that's way we pulled it back. And once we pulled it back, you saw that mitigate, and that will carry us in the first quarter. But from a deposit strategy, just remember overall a couple of things. One is if you look at our deposit pricing, we have been very conservative as rates have stayed low to make sure that we continue to bring that pricing down. In the retail world, we're down to 20-odd basis points, and if you look even in the high-net worth world, we're down in that pricing, and what we've made the decision was to have our customers seeing some of the short-term flows use the off-balance-sheet vehicles and things like that as opposed to on-balance-sheet. So that was a strategy also. There's a third part of this, which is our balance sheet financing construct with a $1 trillion-plus in deposits with the amount of equity we have, is that our banks are extremely liquid. And so taking wholesale-oriented deposits both domestically and internationally, we've been just cutting that back dramatically. So if you look in the fourth quarter, there's about a $20 billion deposit reduction that was engineered off of foreign time deposits and things like that, that overwhelms the good core activities in the businesses, really because we can't use liquidity in a sense at our bank level because liquidity is so strong, and as we're downsizing assets, we're creating more of it. It's a negative carry. So you can see our overall liquidity numbers timed to acquire funding is going up while reducing the aggregate amount of deposits from this more funding characteristics. So I'd say that yes, we had some impact from the $5 debit fee. That's why we made a decision to reverse it. Those impacts in the scheme of things will be manageable, but more importantly, the real deposit phenomena is we're seeing growth, and there's no question as we saw the second half of the quarter more stability around the market. The company, we saw a kick-up even on the corporate side. But the real engineering deposit has been both general rate conservatism, i.e. making sure we're making money for shareholders and doing the job for the customers, but more importantly, on the more wholesale stuff, sort of bringing it down, because, frankly, we can't put the money to work right now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Edward R. Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay, that's helpful. And then finally, about $21 billion of government-insured mortgages that are 90-days past due, I think the whole analyst community is wondering what the risk around the guarantees on that are. I know that question has been asked on a lot of calls to a lot of companies, and it's -- sort of everyone's answer is, well, they're guaranteed. Do you have any more color around that risk other than just sort of saying, well, we think the guarantees are there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I mean, I think the only thing I would say to that, I think is really just further support of that, that a fairly healthy chunk of the guarantees are from product that was purchased from correspondents. And when it's purchased from the correspondent, it's wrapped by the government guarantee at that point. So we feel very good about the fact that it's wrapped. That was the basis -- I mean, significant chunk of those, that the wrap was around it when we purchased it, and we clearly haven't seen anything that would suggest any differently.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Edward R. Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">You're not getting any feedback from the FHA or from any other kind of government entities that those guarantees could be at risk in conjunction with any kind of servicing issues that might be happening on those particular loans?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">No. We do continue to work through the servicing piece of that with the FHA to make sure that we're in conformance with their standards when we go through the foreclosure process, but that is separate and distinct from the fact that those mortgages have the FHA guarantee.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">We'll take our next question from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">If I could just follow up on the expenses, and you've given a lot of color in terms of the initiatives and the puts and takes. But as we think about the full year, I guess you've got $17 billion run rate, $1 billion of stock expense in 1Q. And then just how quickly does the $17 billion come down throughout the year? And obviously, the capital market is a wildcard, but maybe you can just help frame what expenses are going to look like for the rest of the year as well?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I think you would expect to see more of it in the second half largely because the LAS piece, as you can see, that the rate of working it down comes through. And I think it's the severance cost and stuff that help offset sort of the incremental quarter-to-quarter move. But I'd say we've got plans of bringing it down over the course of the year. It's because of FAS, the 123R expense in the quarter. The reported number would not be much, but you'd see sort of that core run rate go down almost linked quarter, quarter to quarter, quarter to quarter, but it will be a little bit more backend-loaded just because the LAS piece takes us getting through. Remember that the foreclosure look back, which cost us $20 million a month or more in there, you've got some other things that you got to get through to get to the other side of it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay. And just in terms of magnitude, any numbers you can put, like where you think you might be on a run rate basis by the end of 2012?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Matt, I don't think we'd answer that one.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay. And then just separately, in the mortgage business, you had some MSR gains, I think about $1.2 billion or so. How much of that was from hedging? And then it seemed like that might have included gains on selling MSRs, which is -- I guess that helps in multiple ways. But if you could just split up the hedge gains versus the gain on sale?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Yes. I'd say a couple of things that the -- if you think about the MSR, when we went into the fourth quarter, we continually look at and look to balance where interest rates are, where mortgage rates are and what declines in interest rates will do relative to mortgage prepays. And so with rates very low in the fourth quarter, we lightened up a little bit on the hedge ratio. Rates obviously went back up, and we benefited from that. The other thing I would say is that as we looked back and saw actual prepay speeds during the fourth quarter based on the interest rate assumptions that the prepayments were not coming in as quickly as we would have expected, and so we adjusted our models to reflect that. As you think about those 2 numbers, I'd think about the $1.2 billion being split about 50-50 between the 2.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Okay. And then I guess the sales of some MSRs is not meaningful in terms of...</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">No. I mean if -- sometimes, you lose a few bucks, sometimes, you make a few bucks. But what we've seen is that the sales that have happened have been generally consistent with where we're marked. And obviously, the real benefit, and I go back to the slide that we show that we track the number of loans and delinquencies, the goal is to continue to shrink the LAS business as quickly as possible so we can get the expense. And that's really what the MSR sales accomplish, not so much any real gain.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Yes. And I guess taking that to the next level, you've exited or winding down the correspondent business, but obviously, you still have all the loans serviced and therefore, the MSR. Is there an opportunity to offload that portfolio, which will obviously help the Basel III capital by a decent amount?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Yes, I would say across the board, we continue to be aggressive in looking to move the MSRs. I think if you look at -- we're starting to see more people bring these kind of packages to the market, so we feel good that we got out in front of this early and that we moved a significant amount of MSRs. And I think the other thing that you referenced to keep in mind is that we've reduced over the course of the last 6 months our MSR as we look forward to Basel III. It's down over $5 billion. It had been up around $12 billion or over $12 billion, and we're now in the mid-7s. So we're continuing to work that down. I don't think you should expect to see as much sale activity over the next couple of quarters as what we saw close in the fourth quarter because a lot of what closed in the fourth quarter were things that were signed up in the third.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Do you think it's possible -- I mean, a lot of the big banks are trying to reduce the MSRs because of the Basel III restrictions. I mean, are the policymakers sensitive that if all the big banks are getting out of MSRs, there's not really enough capacity absorbed at all and that could increase the cost of homeownership and mortgage rates and everything?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">I don't -- I mean, it's not appropriate for me to comment on what the policymakers are saying. I do think that the one thing that's interesting is that obviously, the large servicers have certain standards that are prescribed by the different bank regulators that we've signed up for as part of the consent decree. Obviously, a lot of these sales do go to people that are not subject to that same regulations scrutiny, and I think going forward, it will be interesting to see how that landscape evolves.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">We'll go next to the side of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer &amp; Co.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Christoph M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Yes, just in the supplement, looking at the segment disclosure for Global Banking and Markets. The allocated capital and economic capital is down like 30% to 40% year-over-year. Allocated capital, down from 47% to 33%, economic capital from 37% to 23%. And I guess 2-part question. Part 1 is somehow, that doesn't seem to sync with actual reduction in risk-weighted assets, yet that we've seen. And I mean, why is the capital going down so much more if the risk-weighted assets aren't kind of going down in tandem? And then secondly, I guess the question is if you look at the economic capital there of $23 billion, is that enough capital to run a world-class investment bank, given that JPMorgan allocate $40 billion and Morgan Stanley has $40 billion of tangible common and Goldman has $60 billion?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">I think you're now comparing a lot of different things because there's other operations that are supported, whether that's Goldman or Morgan Stanley. But we have a consistent methodology. As the legacy assets have gone out from an economic capital cost, that has been a very efficient, for lack of better term, reduction. The RWA may be under Basel I, may be 100% risk-weighted or things, but the economic -- we have an economic analysis that we look in the risk-embedded net. As you get the Basel II and III, those 2 things come in sync, as you know. So the equities come down. Let me be clear. If this unit wanted more capital, we'll give them more capital. I think Bruce was clear about that. And so there are -- whether it's their value at risk or whether it's their capital, this is really due to the opportunities and things going on. So there's drivers in the credit quality that's improved dramatically over the last 4 quarters in the unit. There's drivers from the legacy assets, think of things in there from the monoline positions we talked about, the auction rate notes we talked about, the CDO positions being liquidated and taken out. And then on top of that, there is the -- they've brought risk down because the opportunities aren't there to do it. We expect that risk, the good core risk, the risk we want to go back up. And as Bruce said, 5, 7 basis points of capital have been great because implied in that, we'd be making money as opposed to losing money on the trading side. And so don't think that this is a -- this is an outcome of a model that we run all the time and running consistently as opposed to a limit on our capital or anything like that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">And I think the other thing I would say that if you look at the decrease, the one thing and we disclosed in the second quarter that I think you have to keep in mind is that the Bank of America merchant services business was moved from the GBAM business to the commercial business. At the time that it was moved, it was over $5 billion of value that's pure equity. So a significant piece, you're right, that came down was by virtue of a business being moved, not necessarily what was actually going on within the trading businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Christoph M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Okay. And if, I guess, going -- well, both looking back over the past year and looking forward, if you look at the risk-weighted asset mitigation, can you break that up into how much of that is just getting rid of legacy assets that no longer support any current business purpose versus actually trimming back the capital lines to the various trading desks?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">I think I tried to address that when we spoke to the reductions in market risk during the fourth quarter, when we talked about 2/3 of it within the market risk being from getting rid of certain positions, including the securitization as well as some of the structured credit. So once again, I think about that market risk number being 2/3 stuff that we wanted to be done with and 1/3, there were less opportunities. And like I said, hopefully and so far, the first couple of weeks in January, we have seen more opportunities so that that number could come back, but 2/3 of that should be gone.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">We'll take our next question from Matthew Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">I just wanted to follow up on Bruce's comments on the MSR, and I understand what you're saying about what appears to be an MSR hedge benefit in the quarter. I guess I'm just curious, in an interest rate declining environment, to write up the MSR seems a little counterintuitive, particularly given that a couple of your competitors and the more large competitors in the mortgage business didn't do that. And I guess as a follow-up on that, if you end up getting the AG settlement or the industry ends up getting the AG settlement that's rumored to be near, does that -- do you think that will require you and other industry participants to materially write down your MSRs from that specific event?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Two things. We don't see the industry settlement affecting the MSRs. The second thing, with respect to the MSR valuation, I'd make a couple of points. The first is that while rates did decrease, the prepayment activity that we saw relative to expectations was less. The second thing I think you have the keep in mind is that our MSR went from 50 to 54 basis points during the quarter, which is significantly lower than all of our peers. And I think if you look at the remainder of our peers, generally, people either wrote it up or wrote it down within a 5 basis point window during the fourth quarter. So I think we were very consistent with what we saw. But importantly, as far as the capitalization rate, we're the lowest in the industry.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Okay. And then if I could, just a question on Europe. It looks like your exposure to the peripheral countries really didn't change very much quarter-over-quarter from your disclosure. I guess I'm just curious as to some of the recent trends that have occurred since the beginning of the year, if that made you feel a little bit more sanguine about what's going on in Europe and if that is flowing through your view of sales and trading and other opportunities for Bank of America this year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">I think you asked an interesting question. And I think if you think about what we've talked about the last couple of quarters, that we moved fairly aggressively within the Global Banking and Markets area in 2010 to be positioned to where we wanted to be in Europe and, I think, got out ahead of it very early. But your point is exactly right, which is as we look at our company and our results, that the single largest thing or how we're affected by what goes on in Europe is the activity levels that we see within our Global Banking and Markets area here in the U.S. And your point, I think, is a good one, that obviously, November and December, given the volatility, were very difficult. The new issue markets slowed down, and it was tougher to trade. And as we've seen some of the programs and at least some of the resolution that's happened over the course of the last couple of weeks, if you look out at the fixed income markets, they've picked up significantly. The IPO backlog, if there's a market, it's significant. And if you look at the loan business, we're seeing good flows there. So we're only 2.5 weeks into the year, but clearly, some of what's happened in Europe and how people are feeling better there has manifested itself into stronger capital markets in sales and trading during the first part of this year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">And then just one final question. Could you update us on the status of the European Card portfolio sale and if you were to sell that, what your expectation is in terms of the Tier 1 common benefit?</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">I think if you look at the aggregate of the portfolio, it's about $15 billion in risk-weighted assets. And the only thing I'd say at this point is that we continue to look good to go through the process. Outcomes are stating the obvious. We may do nothing. We could look at all of it or there could be a piece of it that goes. But as we go through this process, given the capital and liquidity that we have, we're going to make -- we're going to do what makes sense and just not sell something for the sake of selling it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">And we'll take our final question from Andrew Marquardt with Evercore Partners.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">I want to ask about capital and the upcoming CCAR process. It seems like, based on your commentary, that this year will be focused on capital build and expense control, that is it safe to assume that, again, you will not be asking for any deployment for 2012?</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">We'll be clear with you. We're not going to ask or make sure that we're well positioned with Basel III, so your assumption is correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Okay. And then in terms of the upping of your capital target on a Basel III basis by the end of this year, does that -- I mean, does that kind of show the confidence that you have in terms of not only earnings and the risk-weighted assets coming down, but that there's more room to go and that you can really show improved kind of a roadmap to being in Basel III compliance through this process as well so that there's no additional actions that might need to be taken?</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">I'd say 2 things. I think increasing the guidance first is reflective of the work that we did this quarter and how we accelerated the capital build. And once again, if you go back to the balance sheet side, you can see that we increased our Basel I capital, our common equity, by $9 billion. You should assume that the Basel III number was very close to that. So I think the first thing is that the raise in the guidance in large part was reflective of how we accelerated the actions that we did during the fourth quarter. The second thing to your point, obviously, bringing down the amount of risk-weighted assets that we would think we have at the end of 2012 is reflective of your comment. And the third thing I would say is that we've had this capital team together now for the better part of the year, and I think I would say we're very pleased with how the team's working. And the more you get into this, the more you tend to find, and we're working very hard to drive that forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">I'd say the other thing, moving past '12 and beyond, you have to remember that BAC have been working for the last couple of years to think about as Basel III became clearer in '10 and in '11, and the SIFI and all the stuff became clear. We had to be thinking long term about how you keep positioning the company. If you think about the 3 major deducts from the numerator, the financial institution stakes, the MSR, the DTA, we've done a lot of work on 2 of those. And the DTA will come down as we earn, so there's leverage in that past '12 and out before the deducts become effective. There's leverage in that. And then if you look at the -- as Bruce ran through the denominator, the piece that, Andrew, that people have to keep in mind is that this doesn't stop in 12/31/'12. This -- the process goes on. There's portfolios like the runoff portfolio, and the credit book that was at a high at 120 is down round numbers now 90, runs about 4 billion, 5 billion a quarter will continue to run over that time period. There's things like the structured credit trading book. There are other ways to optimize beyond that. So what we're getting as we do the work that Bruce said and the work we've done the last couple of years is attacking the biggest things first, but there's a lot of, for lack of a better term, smaller things that you just keep working on, working on, a lot of which is not core to what we do day-to-day, and that's we've been pushing through. And so you should expect us to continue to manage this as we have and continue to drive it forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">Got it. So it sounds like there are still some ticky-tack mitigation to go, but nothing major, and it sounds like one shouldn't be concerned about kind of a major kind of action in response to the CCAR stress test?</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">Right.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Kevin Stitt</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">We have one more question, I think.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">And then just separately, just to pile on to the many questions on expenses. I just want to be clear. So expense leverage, there is some this year, but obviously, top line is going to be more muted and mixed. Do you need to have the capital markets businesses recover before you get positive operating leverage this year? Or is there enough expense leverage to get there regardless?</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">I think if you look in the last couple of quarters, if you break out the GBAM and you can see in the revenue, the corporate banking profit there is really fairly stable and moves along. And so we lost $400 million after-tax in that business this quarter. We need that business to come back, or we get to do more on expenses, so we've taken some expenses down. So I think that, that -- but coming back bit from just the third quarter, fourth quarter, taken out all DVAs, so the results recovered even in another difficult quarter. So coming back doesn't mean back to some level that it was at the high point in the first quarter of '10 or something like that. Coming back means $3.5 billion, $4 billion of revenue, and we start making money. That's a lot of leverage in the platform because effectively, between $2.5 billion and $2.75 billion, you are under pressure to make -- that's where you kind of breakeven, start making money as a practical sense on a pure trading side. So we need that, but if we don't get it, we have go to the other side, and that's what this new BAC II process is working on is what is sort of the right, for lack of better term, fixed cost structure, even though a lot of it's variable for comp, but what is the right fixed cost structure given what we see in the market conditions and opportunities. And so we moved early on just sort of the marginal get-it-down, get some people, get some expenses down, but then more fundamentally, how do we reset the base. And so -- but we do need that to get some of the positive operating leverage. The rest of the business, as you look at the consumer side and stuff, they've been ground down by the revenue changes, and now we got to grind -- move forward from there. But if you look at the business, whether it's Wealth Management, whether it's Global Commercial Banking, whether it's Card, you can see those business performing well, and they'll keep clicking along. It's really fixing mortgage, getting it back to profitability, getting trading back to profitability and start to build off of $150 million base in retail. One more question, I think, we have?</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">We'll take our final question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">Actually, part of what I was going to ask, Brian, was about the mitigation results post 2012 because that's something you have spoken about before. But, a, in terms of -- on the mortgage side, just going back to that for a second there, in the reps and warranties, you mentioned that no significant change or no unexpected change from the GSEs, but you did note a little bit of a build in the amount of kind of unprocessed claims, and yet you brought the reserve down. So what is it actually that you saw that allowed you to bring the reserve down? Was it kind of passage through more of the book? I mean, how should we think about that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">Well, the only reason -- I mean, if you think about the reserve, the reason that the reserve comes down is that because to the extent that you saddle up and pay things that you believe that you've owed, it comes out of the reserve, and the reserve comes down. And I think the other thing I'd say is that, as we said, we have $250 million, $275 million of rep and warrant expense, so the reserve coming down was reflective of paying those things that were expected and accrued for. And then obviously, we had a couple of hundred million of expense over and above that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">Moshe, remember this is a little different than other things you can think about in the P&amp;L in a financial service company in that there's really a sealed book of 2004, '05, '06, '07, '08, originations that you're working against. And so the expectations as you -- we provided for all the activity you expect to see out of that whole pool, and then -- so you're going to work this reserve down every quarter because you're using it to pay for stuff that you calculate in your expectations. So it's different than credit or other stuff in that that's the expected outcome because it's a sealed book. When you look at originations from '09 forward to '10, the delinquencies in our portfolios, as Bruce said earlier, are much better than you would have expected when you're originating in '09. So at the end of the day, if the loan doesn't ever become delinquent, we don't talk it. This isn't a problem. The quality of the origination practice and stuff, the products themselves, et cetera, so this is really '04, '08, really '04, '07 quite frankly, sealed bid. And on the private label side, we didn't -- private label market stopped in '08. So you really are looking at a sealed group of loans, and that's why I'd expect the reserves to come down. And agreed, as there's more an impasse, we are consistently applying the standards of resolving. If people are more aggressive on what they put to us, there'll be more impasse, and we'll deal with it over time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">Okay. And just a follow-up on the AG settlement. Obviously, one of the things you talked about was on principal reduction. How do you think about that as it relates to kind of current rate of charge-offs, the amount that's sitting in your reserve and the prospective charge-offs? How do you think a change there is going to impact those items?</p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">We've been doing principal reductions for a number of years now. And the thing is it has -- it's always based on a situation that the assessment is a net present value from the [indiscernible] is better than the alternative, which will be foreclosed and taken through for the investors. And so I think that is a clear determiner of what better value is. So if -- and that's the basis of how you make determination. So I think overall, as I said before, I think reaching a solution here, it would be positive. And as Nancy talked about earlier, it is a rational set of criteria to get to these issues.</p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">And I just want to be clear and I referenced it earlier, the reserves and where we are at year end with respect to the credit reserves within the mortgage business are reflective of our expectations from what we know now what comes out of the DOJ-AG settlement.</p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">This concludes today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, today's call is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to turn the program over to Kevin Stitt. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Kevin Stitt</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning. Before Brian Moynihan and Bruce Thompson begin their comments, let me remind you that this presentation does contain some forward-looking statements regarding both our financial condition and financial results, and that these statements involve certain risks that may cause actual results in the future to be different from our current expectations. These factors include, among other things, changes in economic conditions, changes in interest rates, competitive pressures within the financial services industry and legislative or regulatory requirements that may affect our businesses. And for additional factors, please see our press release and SEC documents.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">And with that, let me turn it over to Brian.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you, Kevin. Before Bruce discusses the results in detail, I just want to take a minute and provide some additional thoughts on the quarter. On our last call, I listed the following areas of focus for our company during 2012: We want to focus on our capital levels, we want to focus on our risk, we want to focus on the cost base in the company, and we also need to drive the core business improvement.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">In the first quarter of 2012, we have made progress in each of these areas. As you can see, our capital and liquidity are at record levels in our company. Our credit costs continue to decline, and our cost structure is coming down, and many of the business, customer and profit metrics have improved.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">So first from a capital perspective. We entered 2012 with increasing strength in our balance sheet position. We managed through the CCAR test and made significant progress on our regulatory capital ratios again in this quarter. Our Tier 1 common ratio reached 10.78% at the end of -- at March 31, 2012.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We continue to make progress on capital at a faster pace than we expected. When we turn to risk, our credit costs fell to the lowest level in nearly 5 years. Reserve levels cover 3.6% of our loans and leases and 2x our current level of annualized credit losses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">The improvement in delinquent and nonperforming assets bodes well for further improvement in net losses as we go forward. As you know, we continue to take opportunities to reduce the remaining legacy assets in the capital markets business, and we believe we have the strong litigation and rep and warranty reserves in the mortgage area.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">On a day-to-day basis, the average value at risk or VaR is lower in our trading business than has been some time. Yet, we managed to make similar levels of sales and trading revenue, excluding DVA as we did last year. The continued cost reduction remains at the forefront of our thinking at Bank of America. We continue to streamline our company. Our priority is to make our company work better for our customers, our teammates and our clients and in the process reduce costs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">As Bruce will show you later, we are achieving those results. We're achieving good results in bringing down expense across our various business lines showing good progress on trends over the past year. One area we continue to work is our Legacy Assets and Servicing area. Personnel costs there are beginning to peak, and after adding significant resources over the past several months to implement a single point of contact in other mortgage programs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We expect these Legacy Assets and Servicing costs to come down in the second half of 2012. Just for your reference in the first quarter of 2012, the expense in Legacy Asset Servicing was $3.3 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">As this cost increased, we passed a milestone. We have now modified more than 1 million mortgages. In addition to the modifications, the pace of the short sales, deeds-in-lieu and other alternative resolutions continues to make progress and continues to quick helping us reduce our delinquent loans overall.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">For the rest of our company, we saw a continued improvement in our costs. We expect to continue to achieve significant cost savings over the next 18 months consistent with our New BAC goals. We're finalizing New BAC 2, Phase 2 as we have told you and would discuss those expected outcomes soon.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">As you are well aware, headcount drives our operating cost in the end, and we expect to see continued progress in this area going forward. This quarter, we added more than 2,500 associates in LAS as I spoke about earlier. But overall, as we work throughout the company in cost management and every other area, we reduced our overall headcount, including those additions in LAS by over 3,000 FTEs. That's on top of reductions 7,000 FTEs-plus last quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">At the same time, as we're reducing our cost, we continue to invest in our franchise and support the economy. During the quarter, to help move the economy along, we extended more than $100 billion in loans to individuals and companies of all sizes. Showing the fifth consecutive quarter of average commercial loan growth to corporate and commercial clients.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We've added client facing teammates in selected growth areas in our company. We've hired 100 small business bankers in this quarter to further support our small business customers, bringing the total of small business bankers since the program began to over 700.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In small business lending, we continue to exceed all the goals we set for small business lending, including the goals we announced last fall in cooperation with the administration and Small Business Administration. In fact, we're up 17% this quarter versus last quarter -- first quarter last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We've added 200 Financial Advisors to our team in the first quarter. As the quarter progressed, we added mortgage loan officers to focus on our direct to consumer mortgage business. As we think about the consumer business as an area we'll continue to work and we spoke about, we continue to respond to changing preferences to optimize our distribution network, while investing where appropriate.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">This quarter, we added 0.5 million mobile banking customers during the quarter. That's about 40,000 a week of pace and continues. We now have more than 9.7 mobile banking-enabled customers. In our industry-leading online banking area, we added another 0.5 million accounts this quarter, active accounts this quarter bringing us to over 30 million active accounts.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In addition, through our ATM capabilities, we passed a milestone. With half the deposits at Bank of America going through our ATMs that used to go through our branch platform. So overall, our customers continue to do more with us through all the channels, including traditional branches, mobile, online and ATM. But they're using the branches less, and that's why we are fine-tuning our delivery network.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We continue to align our banking center network with our customer needs. And this includes reduction and consolidations, which there was a net reduction of 51 this quarter. That's part of the reduction we've spoken to you about of 750 branches over the next couple of years. In select instances, we'll consider branch sales in markets where growth potential and size don't meet our goals. And at the same time, we continue to expand in markets with high density, where new locations can generate good results, and we continue to renovate centers in all the places we do business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We continue to use our leadership position to deepen our relationship with our customers and clients across all our franchise. In the consumer business, we opened 800,000 new credit card accounts this quarter, half of which, even with our focus on credit quality were opened in our branches. Our innovative Bank of America card, Cash 123 card, introduced only 8 months ago now has more than 1 million cards outstanding and has achieved great customer acceptance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In our brokerage and wealth management area, we continue to make progress. Brokers accounts and assets are growing nicely. In our Merrill Edge self-serve area, they've grown nicely year-over-year. But most importantly, our industry-leading capabilities in Merrill Lynch Wealth Management and U.S. Trust, we've seen solid long term assets under management flows this quarter, some of the best we've seen in a while.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Our affluent and wealthy consumers of Bank of America is served by the best team in the business. For the fourth consecutive year, we have more Financial Advisors on Baron's Top 1000 list than any other firm. When we turn to our commercial clients, we saw higher utilization of lines of credit as our commercial customers continue to take advantage of opportunities as the economy continues to grow slowly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Our business is serving clients on our Global Banking segment, and our ability to offer innovative solutions from lending, investment banking, treasury services. All the areas these clients need services, just continuing to produce strong and steady profits, and we have maintained our #2 investment banking position on fees.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">For institutional investor clients, we are encouraged to see a rebound on capital markets activity. We had more than $5 billion in sales and trading revenues this quarter, excluding DVA, and that's a strong quarter. Recorded positive trading-related revenue every single day in the quarter. And this quarter represents the highest ever fixed income results in our company's history. This team did a good job of continuing to build customer depth even in the uncertainty of the world's economic events over the past couple of quarters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Let me close with this before I turn it over to Bruce. The momentum around our strategy continues to accelerate. We still have lots of work to do, but the team is focused and encouraged by these results. We're going to stay focused as we said in the first quarter call, we're going to stay focused on the fundamentals this year and continue to drive forward the results for our clients, customers and you our shareholders.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">With that, let me turn it over to Bruce.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Great. Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I would just echo Brian's comments about the progress that we feel that we made throughout the quarter, and would look to kickoff the presentation starting on Slide 4 of the investor presentation. As we look at that and think about the quarter, we'd note several key takeaways, some of which Brian referenced. We obviously reported $0.03 a share in earnings, but when you look at and consider that number, realize that includes negative valuation adjustments of $4.8 billion pretax or $0.28 a share after-tax, which is the result of our credit spreads tightening significantly throughout the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In addition to those results, we accreted significant levels of both capital and liquidity throughout the quarter, and each of those metrics are at record levels as we ended the first quarter of 2012. As we look at the operating results, Brian referenced capital market activities, and the capital markets generally improved throughout the quarter, driving sales and trading results that were significantly above the fourth quarter of 2011 and in line with what we saw during the first quarter of 2011, once again, excluding DVA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Outside of the sales and trading business, all of our business segments reflected improved profitability during the first quarter of this year relative to the fourth quarter of last year. Credit quality continued to improve significantly, provision expense at $2.4 billion for the quarter was the lowest that we've seen since the third quarter of 2007.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We've talked a lot about expenses. Expenses did decline from the fourth quarter of 2011, despite the fact that we had higher revenue-related incentives, as well as the annual retirement eligible compensation cost that occur during the first quarter of every year. Excuse me, and lastly, I'd highlight, we capitalized during the quarter on the ability to capture significant gains on some of our subordinated debt and preferred securities, $1.2 billion pretax during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">If we turn to Slide 5, where we give a little bit more income statement information. You can see the buildout of the net income of $700 million or $0.03 a share. The one thing I would highlight when you look at the income statement, that the pretax pre-provision number of $3.3 billion does not add back the $4.8 billion of FVO or DVA that we had during the quarter or for that matter any of the other selected items, which I'll go through now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As we look at things during the quarter that benefited net income, I referenced the debt and trust preferred repurchases, in addition to that $1.2 billion during the quarter, we had $800 million of gains both within our private equity portfolio, as well as on the gain on sale of fixed income debt securities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On the negative side, I referenced the $4.8 billion of FVO and DVA. In addition to that we had $900 million of annual retirement eligible compensation cost that once again as you recall, we incur each year during the first quarter of the year, and roughly $800 million of litigation expense, the majority of which was not mortgage-related.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">If we turn to Slide 6, and look at capital. We obviously built significant levels of capital from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of last year when we took our Basel I Tier 1 ratio from 8.65% to 9.86%. We had another very strong quarter from a capital accretion perspective, growing capital from 9.86% to 10.78%. If you look at the components of that increase, 4 buckets that we've laid out here. The first roughly 7 basis points in capital by virtue of the fact that employees were paid a portion of their 2011 compensation in stock. The gains on repurchases of sub debt and trust preferred exchanges and repurchases I referenced were 13 basis points of capital. And most significantly, during the quarter, risk-weighted assets declined by $64 billion during the quarter, which contributed 52 basis points to our benefit in our common ratio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As you think about that 52 basis points of improvement, think about that in the context, 2/3 of that represented pure exposure reduction, and roughly 1/3 of that represented declines as we continue to analyze, refine and optimize our capital calculations. And then lastly, about 20 basis points of capital from earnings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As you look at that earnings, realize that the FVO piece of the charge that I referenced does not negatively impact or positively, if it goes the other way, regulatory capital. As a result of this capital accretion that we've seen during the quarter, we've previously given you guidance that we would expect to be at 7.25% to 7.5% of Tier 1 common under Basel III on a fully phased-in basis at the end of 2012. Based on the improvement we saw this quarter, we're very comfortable increasing that guidance to above 7.5% at the end of 2012.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">If we move from capital to liquidity on Slide 7, you can see that during the quarter, our excess liquidity sources across the company grew by $28 billion to an all-time record of $406 billion at the end of the first quarter. As we look at parent company liquidity, it increased to $129 billion during the quarter, which is up $4 billion. While at the same time, on a net basis our parent company debt was reduced by $5 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Importantly, as we talk about liquidity, we quote a time-to-funding metric. That time-to-funding metric increased to 31 months during the first quarter and with $129 billion of parent company liquidity, we're in a great shape to address the $34 billion of parent company maturities we have during the second quarter, which includes the remaining $24 billion of debt associated with the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program or TLGP.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">As you recall, we worked hard. We no longer -- or have very little parent company or broker-dealer short-term unsecured funding, and as we look out at the balance of the year, we issued just over $5 billion of debt during the first quarter. Based on what we're seeing now, we clearly expect that to be less during the entirety of the remainder of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Moving to Slide 8, to look at certain balance sheet items. I referenced the reductions in risk-weighted assets. You can see that we had about an $8 billion increase in deposits during the quarter. Our tangible common equity ratio remained very strong at 6.58%. Tier 1 common grew by just under $5 billion to $131.6 billion, which contributes to the 10.78% Tier 1 common ratio I just referenced.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Tangible book remained relatively flat at $12.87. And you can see below, our allowance continues to cover our annualized charge-offs by about 2x, and our liability for reps and warrants remained relatively flat at $15.7 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">If we move away from capital and liquidity, net interest income on Slide 9. Net interest income increased sequentially from the fourth quarter to the first quarter by about $100 million. As you look at and think about that change, we benefited from about $500 million of less premium amortization and hedge ineffectiveness. In addition, $100 million improvement by virtue of lowering our rates paid on deposits, as well as the contraction of our debt footprint. And offsetting those benefits were reductions from declines in consumer balances and yields of about $400 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We turn to Slide 10, we've laid out here the changes that we've made from a business segment reporting changes. I'm not going to go through these. We've laid it out there. We filed an 8-K last week. That gave you a lot of information as to what those numbers look like with those changes. And while we apologize for the additional work that it creates, I would note that it very much aligns our business segments with the way that we manage both our customer relationships, as well as the way that we manage the overall company.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On Slide 11, we highlight the results of our Consumer &amp; Business Banking segment. Earnings for the quarter were $1.5 billion, which is an increase of 17% from the fourth quarter and was driven by both lower expenses, as well as lower provision. From a deposit perspective, average deposits were up 1.4% or more than $6 billion during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">The rates that we paid on those deposits declined during the quarter to 20 basis points. As we look at credit and debit card purchase volume, volume had a seasonal decline of 6% from the fourth quarter, but increased 4% from a year ago.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">In U.S. credit card, new accounts grew by 19% from the first quarter a year ago. I would note that as we look at the U.S. credit cards, there's been a significant change in the way that we open new accounts. We're very focused on leveraging our franchise and online networks, while scaling back what we do from a direct mail perspective.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Average loans during the quarter declined $5.6 billion from the fourth quarter due to seasonality, divestitures that occurred at the end of the fourth quarter, as well as the continued runoff of our non-core portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Lastly, within the card space, credit quality continued to improve. U.S. credit card losses improved for the tenth consecutive quarter, and the 30-plus day delinquency rate declined for the 12th consecutive quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Turning to Slide 12 and looking at our Consumer Real Estate Services area. It reported a loss of $1.1 billion during the quarter. That loss was driven by the cost of managing delinquent and defaulted loans in the servicing portfolio combined with costs associated with managing other legacy mortgage exposures.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">The Home Loans business, which is reported within the Consumer Real Estate Services segment, did record a profit of $115 million for the quarter. First mortgage originations of $15 billion were down from the fourth quarter due to our exit from the correspondent mortgaging business. Importantly though, while our production volume was the lowest that we've seen in 5 quarters, production income before the negative impact of reps and warrants was the highest that we've seen in 5 quarters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Our results for the quarter include $282 million in cost for reps and warrants, primarily related to the GSEs. $313 million of litigation expenses, $410 million for expected assessments and waivers cost associated with our servicing operations, as well as overall increased cost related to our servicing operations.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">As you look at the MSR, our MSR asset increased by $211 million during the quarter, driven by higher rates and partially offset by borrower payments and model changes and ended the quarter at $7.6 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">MSR results, net of hedge, were positive by approximately $200 million in the first quarter and as you look at our capitalized MSR rate at the end of the quarter, it was at 58 basis points versus 54 basis points in the fourth quarter and 95 basis points a year ago.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">If you turn to Slide 13, some data that we want to talk about within our Legacy Assets and Servicing area that's within the CRES segment. You can see on a linked quarter basis as well as compared to the first quarter of a year ago, we continue to work hard to reduce the number of delinquent loans and find homeowner solutions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Keep in mind, Legacy Assets and Servicing now reflects all of our servicing operations and the results of our MSR activities. During the quarter, we added more than 6,000 people, both employees as well as third-party staffing in this area in the quarter alone. As we look at the results and as we look to drive down both the number of loans serviced, as well as the number of delinquent loans, the number of first-lien loans serviced dropped 3% in the quarter and more importantly, the number of 60-day plus delinquent loans dropped 6%. Once again, we're very focused on driving the number of 60-plus day delinquent loans down because as we drive those down, it will give us the ability to start reducing cost within the segment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">In Global Wealth and Investment Management on Slide 14, earnings of $547 million more than doubled the results in the fourth quarter of 2011, as higher transactional activity and market levels drove higher revenue, while both expenses and credit costs were down for the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Pretax margin for the quarter was strong at 19.8%. Client balances up 4.8% from the fourth quarter due to higher market levels, while our long-term AUM net flows were 8 -- or excuse me, were $7.8 billion, the second highest that we've seen since the Merrill merger.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Expenses declined versus the previous quarter due to the absence of certain fourth quarter items, including litigation expense and other operating losses, FDIC and severance expense. Net income in Global Banking, Slide 15, was up 19% to $1.6 billion versus the fourth quarter, and essentially flat with the first quarter of last year. Revenue increased 11% from the fourth quarter from higher investment banking fees, equity investment gains and income from leasing transactions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">From a lending perspective, average loans were up slightly as 3% growth in our C&amp;I lending to both large corporate and commercial clients was offset by planned decreases in commercial real estate in the DFS portfolio, as well as trade finance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Average deposit balances at $238 billion declined 1% due to seasonal outflows, as well as certain liquidity management actions that we took. Despite that, our treasury services revenue remained strong at $1.6 billion, up 3% from the fourth quarter and 8% from the year-ago quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Asset quality continued to improve from the fourth quarter. Net charge-offs declined $133 million or 44%. Reservable utilized criticized exposure declined 10% to $18 billion, and our NPA has dropped 11% to $4.1 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">As you can see on Slide 16, investment banking fees firmwide, excluding self-led, were $1.2 billion, up 20% from the fourth quarter as an increase in debt and equity underwriting fees were partially offset by a slowdown in overall M&amp;A activity. We were ranked #2 globally in net investment banking fees for the quarter and about 3/4 of our fees in the quarter were driven by activity in the U.S. and Canada.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Switching to Global Markets on Slide 17, net income of $798 million increased from a loss in the fourth quarter, reflecting increased sales and trading activity during the quarter. Total revenue, ex DVA, was up $3.3 billion from the fourth quarter and in line with what we saw in the first quarter a year ago.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Expenses were up from the fourth quarter, driven by higher revenue, but down slightly from a year ago. Excluding DVA, net income in the first quarter would have been in line with what we saw in the first quarter of last year. I think it's important to know that when you look at that consistency in revenue and net income, it was done with risk-weighted assets that at period end were $192 billion, down $87 billion from a year ago. And average VaR in the quarter was $84 million, down from $184 million a year ago.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Continuing with Global Markets on Slide 18, sales and trading revenues, ex DVA losses, increased $3.2 billion from the fourth quarter, driven by our fixed income area due to improved market sentiment regarding the European financial crisis and an improved domestic outlook. FICC revenue, ex DVA, was 3x the level in the fourth quarter as we experienced increases in almost all product areas. Versus the year ago, FICC revenue was up 12% ex DVA, once again due mainly to improvements in rates and currencies.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">In equities, excluding DVA, results increased 62% from the fourth quarter, driven by increased derivative revenues. However, if we look back compared to a year ago, equity results were down about 18% due to lower overall market volumes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Once again, we recorded DVA losses of $1.434 billion in the fourth quarter as our credit spreads tightened during the quarter, and that compares to losses of $474 million in the fourth quarter of '11 and $357 million in the year-ago quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">On Slide 19, we show you the results of All Other, which once again includes our Global Principal Investments business, the non-U.S. consumer card business, our discretionary portfolio that's associated with interest rate risk management, insurance and the discontinued real estate portfolio. The $4 billion decline in net income versus the prior quarter was driven by the selected items that are listed on this slide, along with litigation expense of $480 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">One other item in All Other that on the income statement flows through insurance revenue is an additional reserve of $200 million that relates to the payment protection insurance claims that we accrued for in the U.K.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">As you can see on Slide 20, total expenses were down from the first quarter a year ago. And except for All Other, expenses are down the year-to-year, in part demonstrating our focus on efficiency across the entire company, as well as the initial impact that we've begun to see from the first phase of our New BAC efforts.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">If we exclude LAS, FTE headcount for March was down approximately 5,600 people from December and down approximately 20,000 from a year ago. Compared to the fourth quarter, expense increases were for the most part, isolated to increases in performance-related incentive expense, LAS cost, as well as business performance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">While I'm talking about expenses, let me spend just a moment on taxes. We would expect the effective tax rate for 2012 to approach 30%, excluding any unusual items. Embedded in that 30% or approaching 30% estimate is that we do anticipate another U.K. tax rate reduction of 2% to be enacted in the third quarter of 2012, which should result in a tax charge at that time of about $800 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And remember though, due to our DTA disallowance, that $800 million charge will not impact our regulatory capital ratios.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">If we switch to credit quality on Slide 21. Overall, consumer credit trends remained positive. Net charge-offs in the consumer portfolio increased during the quarter, but it was due to the absence of approximately $289 million in recoveries in the fourth quarter related to the sale of previously charged-off U.K. credit card loans.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Excluding those recoveries in the fourth quarter, net charge-offs would have been down by about 6%. 30% -- or 30-plus day performing delinquencies continue to drop and provision expense in consumer for the quarter was $2.6 billion and included a $1.1 billion reserve reduction.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">On Slide 22, we show the nonperforming asset trends for both residential mortgage, as well as home equity. Residential mortgage NPAs were down 6% from the end of the year as pay downs, charge-offs, as well as returns to performing status continue to outpace new nonaccrual loans.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Home equity nonperformers did increase from year end due to the impact of interagency guidance to reclassify to nonperforming status junior lien loans that have a first lien loan 90 days or more past due. This regulatory agency guidance resulted in an additional $1.9 billion of home equity loans being moved to NPAs. We have not restated prior periods.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">As you think about that change, it's important to note that it did not have any impact on our allowance or provision expense as we track the underlying first lien delinquency status of our junior lien home equity loans and have previously considered the additional risk that these loans present within our reserving process. If we backout this change, home equity NPAs were relatively flat for the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">On Slide 23, you can see that residential mortgage and home equity 30- to 89-day performing delinquent loans, excluding fully insured loans, were both down. Of the $364 million decline in home equity, $264 million of that was due to the reclassification to nonperforming due to the impact of the interagency guidance that I just mentioned.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">While we typically see strong collections in the first quarter, and while we believe that pace may stunt flow, we would still expect improvement going forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">If we turn to Slide 24, commercial credit trends, we saw improving trends as I mentioned when discussing the results within our Global Banking area. Including the provision for unfunded commitments, we recorded a benefit to provision expense of $226 million. That did include a reserve reduction of $595 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">During the quarter, both nonperforming assets in reservable criticized levels showed declines of 10% on a linked quarter basis. And as I wrap up my part of the presentation before moving to questions, I would just close with 4 comments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">We feel very good about the progress that we made in the operating performances of the different lines of business. We closed the first quarter with record levels of both capital and liquidity, and we achieved these while lowering the overall risk profile of the company. And as we go forward, given the operating environment that we're in, we're very focused on continuing to drive expense levels down during the remainder of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And with that, we'll go ahead and take questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p9\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes to us today from Glenn Schorr with Nomura.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Maybe we could get a little more granularity on FICC. The trading numbers were great and pretty much across-the-board, a big turnaround from last quarter. I want to talk about which piece of the franchise you thought were strongest and maybe any help you can give us on the positioning coming into the quarter, so we think about the rest of the year the right way.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Sure. If you look at and think about the numbers that we gave you. Within FICC, I mentioned on both a -- or on an absolute dollar basis, clearly the most significant area that we saw was rates and currencies. Client flows were very strong, and we saw them in 2 areas. We saw them within Europe, with some of the volatility in the markets in Europe, activities were very high. And the second thing I would say is that within the FICC business, as you think about the high levels of activity that we saw in the investment-grade bond area, that translated into opportunities to do more business with our corporate customers, and that contributed to the results in FICC as well. Outside of FICC, the other areas that were -- that had nice increases during the quarter included our commodities area, which we've been focused on and starting to get some traction in the growth there, as well as in the mortgage area. Those were the 3 most significant areas, Glenn. I'd say the other area that was down a touch during the quarter would have been the overall loan trading area as some of the revenue opportunities given that the new issue business in loans was a little bit slower this quarter than a year-ago quarter. We didn't see quite the opportunity there, but at the same time, that, that area performed very well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">It -- I don't want to put words in your mouth, but it sounds like it was a pretty cash-driven flow as well as opposed to the derivative side?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">That's fair.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Glenn, I think, if you think over last 24 months, Tom and the team have been continuing to build out the breadth of our platform across the world, and we're reaping the benefits of that. So if you think about this quarter this year versus last year, all the prop trading was closed out by mid last year, et cetera, and then -- so that it's really client flows driving. None of this is driven by really, as you said, less derivatives but more client flows, more of the new issue activity, more of the cash business. It's a very core aspect to what we do. So next quarter, because this is a strong quarter in total revenues, it may not be as strong, but the way we're getting there is very consistent quarter after quarter after quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. Appreciate that. Bruce, I wonder if you could just explain [indiscernible] or give a little color on, the 1/3 of the RWA reduction that was the optimization of off-balance-sheet OTC assets?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Sure. If you go through that area, I'd say we continue to work very hard in scrubbing the data. There were certain lending activities that we do that are secured lending activities. That as we work through, we have the ability to optimize from an RWA perspective, so we had some of that. I would say as we look to, and we refine what we do in the markets business, we improve the ability to net as we consolidated certain trading type activities. And we also work through and got third-party ratings on certain of the things which improved that as well. So we continue to be very focused and think we've gotten through the majority of the optimization associated with Basel I as I referenced in the increase in our guidance, we're very focused now on optimizing the balance sheet and looking to drive those Basel III ratios higher as we go throughout the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay, last one for me. Reps and warranty claims continue to rise. Just curious if you can give us an overall comment on a, what's driving it? And b, when we might see a leveling off?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I think what I would say on that, Glenn, I would say it's really consistent with what we talked about when we discussed year-end numbers and with the disclosures that are in the slides. The majority of the increase in the backlog of reps and warrants is in the GSE category. It largely relates to Fannie Mae. And if you saw and compared the third -- the balance of the third -- at the end of the third quarter of 2011 with the balance at the end of the first quarter, you would see that the majority -- a substantial amount of the amounts that are coming in are for borrowers that have paid well north of 24 months. And we obviously continue to have a disagreement with them about whose responsibility those are.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And we'll take our next question from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Maybe we could drill down a little bit more on the expense side. You mentioned the legacy mortgage cost start to come down in the back half this year. Obviously, the New BAC cost saves will probably start to accelerate. When you put that altogether, how do you envision the expenses trending both the second quarter and then maybe as we exit this year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">What I would say, as you think about that, and as you think -- let's spend a moment just on what we saw during the fourth quarter, and I think there are 2 items to note in the fourth quarter when you think of expenses. The $900 million that I referenced is related -- as it relates to compensation-related expense, that obviously, as I said, only occurs in the first quarter of each year. So as you look out at -- over the next group of quarters, that will obviously no longer be there. The second thing, when you think about expenses for the quarter over and above that FAS 123 amount, the expense number for the quarter was up given that the accruals that we had based on the strong performance within the overall markets area. So I think I would level set with those 2 areas, as well as think about some of the mortgage-related charges that I'd referenced. That the goal is, as we work through the year, that those would come down. Once you move away from those expenses, you move to the New BAC expenses. If you think about New BAC 1, we had originally given guidance that it was $5 billion, 20% of which we would recognize during 2012. We obviously took that guidance up and said it would be greater than 20%. So as you look at those consumer businesses on the line of business slide that we gave you, you would expect to continue to see those expenses going down. Obviously, we're in the midst of New BAC 2, which we've looked to wrap up in the May timeframe. And I would just reiterate what we've said there which is that, we don't think the expenses will be as great as what we saw in New BAC 1, although once again, given that they're not as interdependent on technology, we'd look to see those expenses -- those expense savings to start as early as the end of this year. So I would say that it's -- we continue to press through these. I think we wanted to show you the line of business breakdown because I think it gives you a good sense within each of the lines of business outside of what we're seeing in LAS, which Brian talked to about the second half of this year seeing savings, as well as All Other, which can be lumpy to the extent that there are nonrecurring type items showing up that you get a sense for where we're trying to go. But clearly, we would expect sequentially each quarter during 2012 for expenses to go down each of the next 3 quarters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. And then as we think about some of the lumpy items like the litigation, the mortgage rate assessments and maybe any restructuring or severance costs for New BAC parts 1 and 2, any thoughts on the magnitude and timing of those?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes. I think one of the things to keep in mind is that as we've gone through and as we're going through New BAC, we've been absorbing through the P&amp;L the severance cost that goes along with the actions that we've taken. So if you go back to the fourth quarter, we talked about there being a couple of $100 million of severance and related items that we took during the fourth quarter. We had roughly $100 million of those type items that we saw during the first quarter for severance. As it relates to the other items, the only thing I can clearly say about the lumpy items is that each quarter, we accrue them and true them up for what we think our best views are, and we'll continue to do that so it's hard to give any specific guidance about what we may or may not see in any one quarter recognizing that the accruals that we have on the balance sheet at this point are significant.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. And then just separately on the capital side. Obviously, the build the last 2 quarters has been very impressive much more than many of us, including myself, had thought. As we start kind of hearing you guys talk about additional changes from here, whether it's like some branch sales or there is something in the media the other day about you guys potentially looking at selling the non-U.S. wealth management. As we see those things potentially coming up, is that still about a goal of building capital or is it much more about just kind of rationalizing the franchise as Brian mentioned earlier. Just how do we think about, like what's driving the motivation for some of these actions that you might be doing or might be being speculated out there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Without addressing speculation, if you look across the last 2 years, Matt, our goal is to get the franchise against the 3 customer groups and get out of the businesses which don't do that. And everything we've doing is consistent with that. Does it contribute to capital? Yes. I'd say, you shouldn't expect the things in the future to have as much impact as the things we did in the last couple of years, incrementing capital and a lot of the capital generation really comes from the earnings. In the case of Basel III, remember that we -- our biggest difference between our peers is the deductions for disallowed DTA, et cetera, which accrete off over time, and then the third thing was continuing to optimize the balance sheet. So when we're making decisions about various aspects, whether it was Canadian card or something like that, it is in line with the strategy which is, everything we'll have will be direct to customers, focused on those consumers and where we have competitive strength. And then the branches I talked about earlier, it's really fine-tuning the franchise that we have top positions in the top 30 markets. A lot higher than other people by numbers of branches, things like that and continuing to enhance that position, continuing to build out markets behind that, but also focus a little bit more on the markets that there's growth potential and size and scale that we can take advantage of.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And we'll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">A couple of follow-ups. One is on the New BAC. Number two, I'm sure you're going into this with a number in your head and given the first quarter strength, would you be inclined to be kind of taking that down relative to what you had been expecting? I would think you can make some arguments for less pull back than maybe you thought before?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I think, one of the things, Betsy, that we're very focused on is given that the environment relative to when we had started New BAC 1 has started to improve a little bit. We're very focused on not taking a step back, but continuing to drive what we saw in both New BAC 1, as well as New BAC 2. Keep in mind, a lot of what New BAC is, relates to simplification, it relates to getting rid of work that doesn't need to be done, and it relates to becoming more efficient. So while I think I'm clearly on the margin this quarter, you feel better about the overall sales and trading opportunity. It's not going to change the rigor and discipline with which we go through New BAC 2. And once again, we think given that we don't have as much technology, we'll be able to get after those costs quicker than what we saw in New BAC 1. The other thing that I think is important and even though it's not part of New BAC, if you look at both the Global Banking, as well as the global bank or as well as the Global Markets expense levels, you read some of the reductions that we made during the third and fourth quarters of last year outside of the New BAC process, and you start to see some of the benefits of those flowing through, and you'll see more of those next quarter as the people actually come off the payroll.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. And then separately on Page 9, you go through the NII. Could you just give a little bit more color around the hedge that you've got? I know you've got one on the AFS portfolio and give us a sense as to how you're managing that right now?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I mean, largely, a lot of those tend to be more pay fixed. So I think if you look at the variability, they will bounce around a little bit depending on where the rate curve is. But I think if you look out over the last couple of quarters, they tend to be within a range of several $100 million, and they've been relatively fixed within that range. And that's why we wanted to give you the guidance so you could get a sense as to what the core NII was backing out any changes that happened due to those.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. So you haven't changed the size of that, that much?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Not at all. And indeed, I would say the other thing that we're very focused on is managing the interest rate risk as we look out to Basel III. Given that OCI will flow through capital, we've been, I think, very conservative in making sure that we manage this in a way so that at some point in time, when rates start to move up, that we don't have an OCI hit through that investment portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">We'll take our next question from Paul Miller with FBR.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets &amp; Co., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">On your home equity portfolio, I know it's been -- a lot of stuff has been -- new guidance out on -- pushed on recognizing NPAs, some of those loans that were the first to have defaulted. What do you do when you've modified the first? Can you talk a little bit about, do you -- how do you treat the seconds? Do you modify the seconds also with the first? And how do you classify those seconds?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes. I think there's a couple of different ways to look at that problem. Let me spend just a moment. I'm glad you asked about the seconds behind delinquent first. If you go back and look at the disclosure that we've put out at year-end with respect to our seconds behind delinquent first, you'll see that at year-end, as we took a look and did the work, we had roughly $2.5 billion of current seconds that were behind delinquent first. Throughout the quarter, as we continue to work with -- and keep in mind, the majority of our home equity portfolio where you have the first behind delinquent first, we do not have the first, so we need to work through the credit bureaus to understand exactly what the status of that first is. And as we've worked through and done more and worked with the credit bureaus to understand those seconds behind delinquent first, that the guidance and when we adjusted up our nonperformers to the $1.9 billion, that's an improvement from what we saw at year end of the $2.5 billion that's out there. I would say secondly, as you think about and what we do through the reserving process with respect to both first and seconds. Even though we may have and we obviously changed the way that the nonperformers are reported this quarter, but we are very cognizant when we look at and have both our formulaic models, as well as the imprecision reserves that we overlay on our portfolio that to the extent that you have seconds that have a delinquent first, we are going to adjust our assumptions to be conservative as it relates to where we feel like were reserved. And I think this new guidance as we came out and as we work through it at the end of the quarter and update it, we feel very good about where we were at the end of the first quarter relative to year end. The other thing that I would say, when you ask about the different home equity portfolios is if you go back to Slides 34 and Slides 35 that we have in the investor deck, I think there are a couple of important things to point out. The first is, if you just go Q4 '11 to Q1 '12, you can see that we continue to see fairly significant pay downs within our home equity portfolio. And I think importantly, if you look at the overall FICO scores, as we've updated and work through the FICO models that the refreshed FICO on our home equity portfolio is now at 742. So I think across-the-board with what we've seen in the quarter, well I think we're very sensitive to that there's not the growth that we'd all like yet in the economy. We've been very focused on the home equity portfolio and so far, during the first quarter, it's performed better than we would have expected.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I think the other thing to add to that is 2 things. One is, think of everything has been originated now for 4 or 5 years, has been originated under fairly conservative -- very conservative standards and traditional going through early 2000. So everything that's been added to the portfolio is very carefully underwritten. And then the second is, at the end of the day, ultimately the cash is the cash. So ultimately, the person who either doesn't pay or pays on their first, ultimately that first goes through liquidation and ultimately the second is dealt within that liquidation, and the proceeds come in. So moving around the timing and reporting is one thing, but ultimately over a period of the courses of months and quarters, it's the cash becomes the cash. And so, what's reflected if you look at some of these long term on Page 23 and these charts, as you can see activity has been going on for many years now and that the simple matter is each quarter it gets incrementally better, and this is the part of our portfolio we're still doing the most work because it's the slowest to fully recover. If you compare it against the Card business or other businesses that have fully recovered and continue to have more upside, this will take us longer just because of the nature of the process. A lot of talk about this, but ultimately it comes through in terms of the cash is the cash.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets &amp; Co., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Guys, that was a really great update and I appreciate it. But going back to the question, part of the question was, how do you treat modified loans? Like when you modify the first, how do you --  what type of activity you take on the second? And then how do classify that second lien?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Well, if there's -- up until the change in the guidance, if you have a second lien that's current, and you have a first lien that's delinquent or have been modified, you're not going to adjust the second. What the new guidance now provides is that if you have a first lien that's more than 90 days, so as you look at the March balance sheet, if we have a first lien loan that's more than 90 days past due, we are now characterizing the second lien as a nonperformer.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets &amp; Co., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And if you modify, like under these various modification programs, and if you modify the first, would you modify the second also? And then would you classify that as a current or a TDR or a nonperforming loan?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">It's very difficult. You have to realize, Paul, that there are 2 different situations that we have. We have situations where we have both the first and the second. And then we have situations where we have the second and somebody else may have the first. And I think the important thing to keep in mind is that as we went through and came up with this nonperforming data, we only take somebody off or only look at a loan where there is a nonperforming aspect to it. It only gets cleaned up by virtue of the credit bureau after they've been current for a year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">We'll take our next question from Nancy Bush with NAB Research LLC.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Brian, one of the things that you emphasized was improvements in the core businesses. Could you just give us some color on the businesses that are meeting or exceeding expectations versus those that are lagging? And what you're doing or maybe doing in the lagging businesses?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I think if you think about the businesses across the 5 segments. In the consumer area, I'd say that we're very encouraged by the initial results and things like I said, about the mobile banking enrollments and things like that, which help us reduce the cost structure in the general retail business as we call it. And so we need to improve that business. All the regulatory changes that are well known to you, Nancy, over the last couple of years took away a lot of profit and an interest rate environment, which we're familiar with. But the reality is, if you look at the underlying customer dynamics, we're seeing improvements in online, mobile, the ability to fine-tune the branches, the cost of the branches per dollar of deposit, which is a metric I look at, has improved and dropped again this quarter. The rates paid in deposit continue to work their way down. So it's improving, but it's still at the $300 million to $400 million of profit. You can see in the core consumer deposits business, we need to make some upside from there. Now let me flip to the place we're having good success there. On the preferred side of that business, which is the 8 million customers that have a higher annual income, spent a little bit more with us. We're seeing great uptake in the service model we created, which is differentiated service model, and the FSAs we've put in the branches, which are Financial Advisors in the branches which do 2 things. One is, they serve clients, who are sort of below the threshold for the affluent group, and they also refer clients into the affluent group. The mortgage officers working with those groups in the branches that have been sort of designated as preferred branches, we're seeing great uptake there and strong growth and strong penetration across. You can see in the Merrill Edge, assets grown year-over-year. You can see in the flows of customer accounts. So that we're very excited about. So retail mass-market is more fine-tuning the delivery system and continuing to get incremental growth there, but the preferred is growing well. The wealth management business, I think, is performing very well, $500 million of profit, margins are better than anybody in the industry. We continue to see that in the core commercial banking business. The Global Banking segment was put together to highlight that business with $1.6 billion in profits. It's fairly steady, provides good returns on a very capital-intensive business. Obviously, the lending has shaved off its commercial real estate exposure. It continues to perform return above the cost of capital. If we were talking last quarter, we'd be talking about the Global Banking business needing to recover, and we saw it this quarter. So as you look across it, a lot of work to do in mortgage, and I won't take you through that. Work to do in the core consumer retail franchise, optimizing the cost, but a lot of that progress is taking place, and we sort of seen the bottom. I think sort of last year as the final vestiges of Durbin came through. Seeing that come up and then across sort of the relationship business in wealth management, in the preferred segment of consumer wealth management, and Global Banking seeing strong, steady profits and then in Global Banking -- or Global Markets we saw a nice recovery, so we're excited about that. That all poured through as we removed the cloud of the mortgage business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Bruce, a question for you. The core margin ex the market-related assets I think has hit 3% again. Is that maintainable? And if I could just ask you to speculate or forecast, I mean, when we get back to a more normal rate environment, what is an achievable sort of normalized margin for the company?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So I think I'd make a couple of observations. I think when you look at and what we had talked about before was that as we think about 2012 and as we talked about year-end, as you think about 2012, the amount of NII we're reporting I think is a pretty good range if you back out either plus or minus what we saw from hedge in prepay. I think if you look out at core margin and you think about where we are, there's nothing over time once the rate environment changes with the exception of having less credit card in the portfolio that would change what we've been able to achieve historically in margins with one exception. And the one exception that we're very focused on and one of the biggest opportunities we have with core margin is to continue to shrink the debt footprint that we have of the company. And when you think about the $35 billion in maturities that we have in the first quarter, or excuse me, in the second quarter of this year, as well as the amount of liquidity we have that outside the core businesses that we have where you can kind of project what the yields are, the biggest opportunity we have to drive that down is using the liquidity to shrink the debt footprint, which on average, as we repay that tends to be 300 and 400 basis points on a floating basis relative to the underlying LIBOR.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I think, Nancy, if you look at the long-term average, I think it's been closer to 3% across time. Assume that the mix of the assets may shift and so it's safe somewhere below that, but from the 2.50-ish, we kind of run at now to -- we've told you before, 2.75% should be easily within range with a short-term rate that moves up 100 basis points or so and we still feel comfortable that's the mix of business we have and in fact, we may have tightened that a little bit as we've tightened down the balance sheet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And we'll take our next question from John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Bruce, just following up on that last point. Just sounds like for this year, net interest income was $11 billion this quarter. It sounds like you're kind of running in place perhaps the next couple of quarters unless something changes on the rate front or loan growth?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I think that's fair, John. I think just realize though that when you look at that, if you look at the quarter, but think a little bit about the benefit that we had during the quarter from the prepay and the hedges. I would not assume that, that's in the run rate during the next couple of quarters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Was that a benefit or just a lack of a negative compared to last quarter? Was it a positive benefit this quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">It was both. It was a negative that swung to a positive during the quarter and like I said, on a linked quarter basis, it was about $500 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">What about just how much it was as a net positive this quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I believe it was in the mid-300s, John.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. And then on credit. What kind of outlook do you have on the ability to keep up the current pace of reserve release? Do you expect the size of the reserve release to come down going forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I think as we look out at -- and we look at the models, John, I think the right way to think about it is that we would expect that charge-offs would continue to decline as we go throughout 2012 quarter-over-quarter. And I think what you're likely to see is that the benefit from reduced charge-offs is probably going to be more or less offset by lower reserve releases. So as you look at the overall provision number going forward over the next 3 quarters, while there may be a little bit of variability, I think that'll be a pretty good proxy for you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay, and then one little nit pick question. In the first quarter, the diluted share count declined by about 300 million shares even though the stock price went up, you issued shares to employees. Is that impacted by the Buffett warrants or why would it have gone down this quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yes, you've got 2 different things going on. And the simplest way that I can say it, John, is that in a quarter, we're on a reported basis that we're north of $0.11 or $0.12 on a reported basis. You're going to see the Buffett shares in, and on a reported basis, when we're below, they're out. So as you think about this quarter, given that the impact of DVA and FVO and what it did to EPS, they were out and then obviously part of the reason why they were up a little bit in the quarter was because of some of the exchanges that we did throughout the fourth quarter of last year, as well as the employee shares that were issued during the first quarter. Those are the things that comprise the difference.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay, so those things were overwhelmed by the Buffett coming out this quarter because of the reported earnings?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">That's correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. And one last follow-up on expenses. The LAS this quarter was $3.3 billion. First, did you say that you think those have peaked? And then second, given that it's kind of a restated number now, with the restatement. What's a good eventual number for LAS do you think longer term? I think previously you had said of maybe a few $100 million per quarter kind of a normal servicing over time?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yes, I think we said, sort of a $500 million a quarter. That's more of a normal servicing based on our estimates of what our portfolio will be at that level.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">That's still the case the way you've stated that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yes. I think, John, we're seeing the -- if you look at the slide, it'd show you sort of the work is about the delinquent loans, and you're seeing those drop, and we'll see those come down. As we've said, it'll take us the rest of this year and into next year, probably through next year to get it more normalized. But we're very encouraged by the amount of work that's getting done and the staffing levels we have. Just so people are clear, we talk about the 40,000 employees we have here. We also have around 10,000 to 15,000 contractors that work in this business. So if you think about our total headcount, think of how much of our -- of 278,000, 40,000 is deployed against this. So when this comes down it will have a significant impact on the company's activities on a day-to-day basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Just to clarify that, Brian, you're not expecting to get from $3 billion to a couple of $100 million in a year, right? That's a couple.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">No, it'll take us this year and next year and then it will really show up in '14. It will keep coming down during this timeframe, but I'd expect normal to really get it behind us is probably in the '14 just because we'll get the activities down. It'll take us a little while to shape it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay. And then the last thing for me was, Bruce, on the assessment of waivers back up to $410 million. Just why is that up so much? Is this the reserve and is this related to your kind of dispute with Fannie Mae?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">There are a couple of things. There was a chunk that we had that when we looked at that we set aside for reserves on servicing advances and there were other assessment type things like you'd expect with Fannie Mae. So think about it in those 2 different context.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay. And is that something that you have an outlook on that could continue at that level or is it they're just impossible to predict?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">We would not expect it to continue at that level.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay. So somewhere between $0 and $400 million?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Definitionally, that's correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">We'll take our next question from Mike Mayo with CLSA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">My question was on loan growth. And I see, Global Banking loans are flat. GWIM loans are flat. Consumer is down. And it's looks like some sort of deceleration. So are you seeing a swap from at least the large loans to the capital markets? Or how do you describe what's taking place? Is there a slowdown in the U.S. economy? Are you deliberately backing away from some credits? Any color you can give would be great.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Sure. I think what I'd say is a couple of things on that, Mike. The first is that, we have a very strong both commercial and corporate franchise. And obviously, we're very focused and especially given where we've built capital levels now, as we go forward to look to build off and to grow traditional C&amp;I loans, both within the commercial, as well as the overall corporate bank. I think when you look at in 2 of the things or 3 of the things as I referenced that were slight offsets that we made a decision on during the quarter is that we've continued to work through, and we've got our commercial real estate lending down to an area that we feel good about. So going forward, you wouldn't expect to see the reductions in commercial real estate that you've seen over the last couple of quarters. The second thing I would say is that we did during the quarter, given what the market opportunity was and where pricing and securitization pricing was, to securitize some of our DFS assets out in the market, which led to some of the reductions. That's something that was opportunistic and quite frankly gives us a base to be able to go out and grow and do more with our customers on. And then the third thing that was a little bit lighter relative to year end was on the trade finance side. That, that it will ebb and flow, but as we've talked about before, we're very focused on growing the international footprint as well. So I think, while on the overall -- from an average balance sheet perspective, it looked kind of flattish. We did see some growth within the areas that we're focused, and those areas that there were reductions, we feel like we're generally down to and have done the things that we want to do to the point where we can start growing off that base. I think if you move to the consumer space, I would just note a couple of things as people look at loans in the consumer space. Obviously, as we look at the home equity business, that the balances were down about $3.5 billion in home equity. We clearly are not doing a lot of new home equity lending now, and the fact that those balances are going down, we view as a very good thing. The second thing is, if you look at our supplement, you'll see that the residential mortgage area is coming down. Keep in mind, that's not due to residential mortgages that were originating as we look to manage the overall risk profile and interest rate profile, there's a constant look at, do we want to own whole loans or do we want to own securities? And at the end of the quarter, at the first quarter, we were a little bit more into securities than whole loans. And then the last thing I would say on loan balances is just within the Card business that seasonally your card balances obviously tend to peak in the fourth quarter. So the declines you saw in the Card business in the first quarter were largely seasonal.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And then just one follow-up. It seems as though your market share in cards and mortgages has declined. Do you agree or disagree? And if you agree, is this a deliberate move? Are you underperforming what you'd like to achieve? Or is this simply prudent given what you're seeing in the market?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">So Mike, if you look at -- let's take mortgage first. If you look in the fourth quarter, we did about $15 billion of direct to consumer originations, and in the first quarter, we did about the same. So the real steep drop in \"our market share\" out there has been on the correspondent side just going to 0. So if you look year-over-year, it dropped $20-odd billion in production. That is an absolute deliberate move. We will move -- we will be in a direct to retail channel for both our general customers and then also our affluent and wealthy customers. It's a business we think we have an advantage in, and we'll continue to drive that. That being said, as we retool that business, we underperformed on a direct to retail. And we expect that and as we moved through each quarter, each month of the quarter, we saw improved results in just straight volumes, and we've added more loan officers. We've focused the people to getting several thousand in the quarter of referrals from the branches and working with their teammates there. We've staffed up on the fulfillment side to increase our throughput. You'd remember there's some noise about a reservation system earlier on. So we underperformed, but we're doing exactly what we wanted, which is to focus on direct to retail. The team's working hard. David Darnell and the team and you'll see us improve there. But the correspondent is behind us, and as I said, if you want that business back and go out and buy in the market is not actually a customer-driven business in the way we look at businesses here in the company. When you go into the Card business, I think we have been continuing to fine-tune and have sold off some portfolios. We're providing the card as a backbone to other companies. Meaning, the financial companies, and then we sold those portfolios back to them as part of fine-tuning the business. I'd say that we have performed as anticipated in card. We brought the direct mail down. This quarter, we did 800,000 new cards, as I said, half through the branch system with the credit quality you can see in our numbers, which is outperforming what we had expected as we put the cards on over the last couple of years. So we should expect to hold our share there and start to drive it. But we still are in the straight raw market competitiveness of 15% versus 16% or something like that in the fourth quarter. It really is based on us continuing to shape the affinity groups and some of the vestiges in the U.S. business of the past. But you should expect that to stabilize now and start to grow. That's been the strategy we told you we would start in 2009 honestly, and it's behaving the way we said. That being said, there's plenty of opportunity for us drive the Card business in our franchise. So we have the 800,000 originations, the 1 million Bank of America Cash 123 cards. We will drive that business back up, but again it'll be focused on the customers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Just wanted real quick hit on the tax rate. I got to 9% for the quarter. Is that right? And what's driving that? And were there any unusual items in there that when you hit on your 30% tax rate for the year, we should sort of consider when we think about the full year tax rate?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yes, I think, the thing when you look at taxes for the first quarter, what you have to keep in mind is that because of the large DVA and FVO charges that went through the P&amp;L, the pretax income after those charges was reduced. So you have a couple of preference items in the first quarter that when they're compared on a book basis to a relatively low pretax income number, it tends to distort the effective tax rate. So as we -- and I'd just say what I said during the presentation, as you have a more normalized quarter without the DVA and the FVO, we would expect the rate for the year to approach 30%. And the one unusual item that I would note in that rate approaching 30% is that we'll have the $800 million adjustment for the U.K. tax rate, given that the tax rate is going down in the jurisdiction where we have a DTA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay. And then on the rep and warranties, it seems as though there's a new lower level provision that you guys tend to be running at, which really reflects BofA's view. Yet, we've got steadily increasing Fannie claims, and I'm just kind of curious how those resolve themselves and maybe also how much of those claims are tied to MI through rescissions or cancellations of insurance?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Yes, I mean, at this point, it's a couple of things. The first is that -- and as we talked about both at year end and this quarter, we continue to adjust and provide reserves for the MI rescission and continue to work through that process with not only Fannie but other places where MI is topical, and our reserves reflect that. I think with respect to your original question, as it relates to reps and warrants, we obviously look at and provide the rep and warrant each quarter based on what we're seeing and based on our interpretation of the documents, which I can assure you we've had numerous people look at and feel very strongly with where we are. I don't think it's probably appropriate for me to reflect or to comment on what Fannie's view on that may be.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Oh, sure. That's fair. I guess I'm just trying to understand as far as the MI impact is concerned. Is it that BofA is providing the rep and warrant that valid insurance exists? And then therefore the GSE has a claim against BofA? And then BofA has to go pursue that actual -- has then a claim against the MI? Can you help me understand how that works?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">You're right. And in our disclosure, we talked about in certain cases where we do need to go and pursue and work with the different reinsurers to get the payments that were due. And what I would say is that, each quarter as we go through this, the reserves that we put up as it relates to the risk of mortgage rescission, the reserves apply both to the GSEs or anywhere else that, that could be a risk for us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay. And they would reflect, if there is any deterioration in counterparty, those reserves would reflect that as well?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Absolutely.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay. okay, great. And then last for me on capital markets. You made some comments about VaR, but just if you could talk about maybe what happened with risk in the quarter? Did you guys take on risk, particularly in FICC? Which given what happened, if you took it on at the beginning of the quarter, certainly it would have worked out well. And then maybe give us an idea of how much of a tailwind for FICC you guys benefited as far as the tightening credit spread environment?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">A couple of things. The first thing that I would say is that the -- as I referenced, the largest driver in the FICC business this quarter was our rates and currencies area. And that strength that we saw in the quarter was due solely or due largely, I guess, I would say to client flows where we were doing more with our clients during the quarter. So that is good core flow business for us that we saw during the quarter. And I think that if you look at both the risk-weighted assets and the VaR, they support that in that what we're saying is that, we're able to take less risk and make -- and if you look at both RWA, as well as VaR, they were roughly half of what they were a year ago, and we were still able to generate the same level of revenue. And I think when you think about that revenue number and you think about the level of risk, what it's reflective of is the fact that our client-facing businesses during the first quarter were very strong. And I think -- the only thing I'd say is that as we've continued to build the balance sheet, build capital and as we've seen our credit spreads tighten, the one thing I would say is that we are seeing more and more people that are doing more and more business with us. And we feel very good about that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Just to be clear, we have not changed the limits this business operates on in 7 or 8 quarters. So the ability to do what they need to do to participate in the market is there, and they're making the choices based on opportunities and capabilities that they have to do it. And are well within the risk measures and producing as much revenue. So I think the team's doing a great job of really driving the business along the way that you would want them to.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">We'll take our next question from Moshe Orenbuch with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Just a follow-up on the GSE activity. 2 separate points. First of all, with all the -- despite all the rhetoric about the GSEs kind of expanding what they're looking at, it looks like this quarter actually had a smaller kind of new claims from the GSEs than the last -- at least the previous 4. But at the same time, you're kind of activity either approving repurchases or rescinding them were both kind of much, much lower. Could you talk about what's actually going on there and what it's going to take to get some more of this resolved as we go forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">What I would say is generally -- and any one quarter can bounce around a little bit. But just to reiterate, I would say that the activity that we saw during the first quarter was not significantly inconsistent with what we saw during the fourth quarter. But you're right, and the data you just quoted, you would expect to see the number of repurchases as a percentage to decline to the extent that you disagree with what's coming in.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Moshe, you're assuming that a loan in every quarter for the last 10 quarters is exactly what they send in is the same, what's happened is it's different. And so the result of the activity is different because what is sent after being sent is different. It's not that the volume is different.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Got it. A couple of other quick things. First actually, you mentioned before the correspondent business and the Mortgage business kind of being focused on the core Bank of America customer. Is there any thought about thinking about that in the credit card business as well and kind of doing something with some of the affinity business, the national credit card business that doesn't kind of overlap with your customer base?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Just to be clear. The correspondent business is out of the Mortgage business. So it's a direct to retail business. In the Card business, we have an affinity group, and we've narrowed that group of affinities over the last 3 years to be consistent with where we think it adds value to the customer and to the company. And so we have major affinity programs which are very valuable to us that we continue to drive growth in. What we've done is pared off several thousand of programs, which the economics just didn't make sense. So we have achieved that. I think those are affinities with big brands that we benefit by as a company as opposed to affinities, frankly where we are providing a credit card for another financial institution that provides a core product to their customers. That's what we really gotten out of and then smaller groups that just didn't have the volumes to make sense.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Great. And just one quick last thing and that is, obviously, some terrific progress on the capital front. I didn't catch, if you had said this before, but do you -- have you  changed your expectation of kind of year end risk-weighted assets under Basel III or has been the improvement -- has the improvement been kind of more from the numerator or is it denominator-driven also?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">If you look at it, it's going to be a little bit of both because as I referenced, as you think about what we got through and once again, under both Basel I, as well as Basel III, we are in a disallowance under Basel I of DTA and in Basel III, we're over the 15% sin bucket. So as we generate net income and as you think about the piece that's FVO not being in it, the numerator is benefiting. And then secondarily, the denominator as we continue to work through and optimize, it will improve. We obviously have taken the guidance on Basel III at year end fully phased-in up above 7.5%. We will look to give you greater detail on both numerator and denominator when we look at Basel III at the end of the second quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">We'll take our next question from Jefferson Harralson with KBW.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Jefferson Harralson - Keefe, Bruyette, &amp; Woods, Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">As a question on LIBOR, there's been some ruckus overseas on how it's set and regulators being concerned about potential, I guess, issues with how it's set. Can you comment on how BAC participates in the setting of LIBOR. And if you have reserves or any concerns over this process as it plays out?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">This had been going on a while. We wouldn't comment. I'd leave it to our lawyers to talk to you about it. But that's been going on for a couple of years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Our next question comes from Andrew Marquardt with Evercore Partners.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Just wanted to circle back on the margin NII commentary. In terms of -- I think you're basically saying that we should think about NII, basically holding. But I want to go back this quarter, you had the benefit that's not going to repeat. But then what were the drags? Again, you had mentioned earlier, maybe I missed it in terms of some consumer yield pressure, but then is there also a core asset yield pressure because of the low rate environment?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">No, the biggest thing, Andrew, if you think about it was that the -- and keep in mind we're thinking about NII now, not pretax income. The biggest difference in the quarter that was a drag was the fact that we had over $8 billion of card receivables from the Canadian card business, but that sale closed at the beginning of December. So as you think sequentially, and you think about those consumer balances and consumer yields, that was the biggest piece of it and obviously, the number that we've put out there was that it was to the tune of about $400 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Got it. And then in terms of outside of that commercial pricing competition, asset yield pricing, asset yield pressure, is that manageable it seems like?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">I think it's manageable. I think the only other thing that I'd say is that as you look out at NII and when you run the size of the investment portfolio that we run from a rate management perspective as rates bounce around and as some of those mortgage and other type securities yields either go up or down will fluctuate with that. But there was nothing really notable for the quarter from that perspective.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Okay. And then in terms of looking at the pre pre, this quarter came in just under on a core basis, maybe $7 billion, materially better than last quarter, which was just under $4 billion. But then this quarter obviously helped by FICC in mortgage banking, that may not repeat. I mean, how should we think about that kind on a core run-rate basis? And will that improve largely now due to expenses continuing to improve based on Phase 1 and then Phase 2 next year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">I think there's a couple of things. Obviously, in any one quarter, if you think about variables, you've got on the revenue side, the one variable piece that we have in revenues is going to be what you see from a sales and trading perspective. That there is a level of variability in that, either up or down. I think from a revenue perspective, given that you've backed out the different security gains and private equity gains, when you quoted that $7 billion, that's going to be the one number from a revenue line that does have the variability to it. And then I think your point is exactly right, that what we can do to look to drive that number up is largely going to be on the expense side.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">And do you still have confidence in, maybe it's an outdated range now of 45 to 50 on an annual basis? Is that still valid or have things changed enough that, that needs to be rethought?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">I think on the prior calls, we brought -- that range has been a lower range just because we sold off a lot of the credit card and stuff when that number was originally published, but I think as we said last quarter, we're continuing -- confident that we can push the number, given the time and the interest rate environment and over $10 billion a quarter, but it's going to take that normalized interest rate environment and economy growing at 3%. As opposed to the economy growing at 1.5% or 2%, which is what we've been consistently seeing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">And then lastly, just on capital. Any updated thoughts on potential deployment? May be still too early but may be more confidence now that bumping up your goal and target for Tier 1 common Basel III of 7.5% by the end of the year. Any updated thoughts on when or how or maybe some thoughts also kind of lessons learned from what happened with Citigroup?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">I think we were clear in the CCAR. We said, and we came through that test, and we were clear before that we didn't apply for anything in 2012. I don't think we changed our thinking that as we work to make sure that we drive towards being Basel III compliant over the next couple of quarters. So I think we're -- we have a high confidence in our capital, a high confidence that we have the right capital and high confidence that we're building at a good pace that we knew before, but now you all see. And so I think we'll just keep playing it through the end of this year in this way.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Got it. And too soon to call until maybe towards the end of the year where capital stands ultimately in the outlook macro-wise, is that fair?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">I'm sorry, I didn't hear the very end of that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Is that fair to assume kind of too soon to call in terms of is 2013 the year? In terms of maybe starting at least you think about it or at this point?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">We'll let you know when we -- we've said consistently, we'll apply when we know we'll get approved, and we can work closely with our regulators to get that through, and we'll see how we proceed through this year and the next.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Kevin Stitt</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">That was our last question. I'd like to thank you for participating.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Thank you, everybody.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Bruce R.

(Operator Instructions) Please note that today\u2019s call is being recorded.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">It\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the program over to Kevin Stitt. Please begin, sir.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Kevin Stitt</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning. Before Brian Moynihan and Bruce Thompson begin their comments, let me remind you that this presentation does contain some forward-looking statements, and please review slides two and three with information around forward-looking statements. And for additional factors, please see our press release and SEC documents.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">And with that, let me turn it over to Bruce.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Great. Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m going to start on slide four. And as you all saw this morning, we reported net income of $2.5 billion for the second quarter, or $0.19 a share on a diluted basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">You will notice at the bottom of the page, we do not have any selected items that we brought forward during this quarter. And given that the list is relatively short, we\u2019ll just hit those as we go throughout the presentation within the lines of business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We go ahead and move forward to slide five. We clearly believe that the results in the second quarter demonstrated our ongoing momentum on several fronts. Capital continued to strengthen and is at record levels by most metrics.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Tier 1 common capital increased $2.5 billion to $134 billion and ended the quarter at 11.24% under Basel 1. We estimate the Basel 3 Tier 1 common equity with 8.1% at the end of June, on a fully phased-in basis, based on our current understanding of both U.S. market risk rules and international Basel 3 guidelines.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">If you recall, we had estimated we would be in excess of 7.5% under Basel 3 at the end of the year. So based on where we came out at the end of quarter, we\u2019re quite pleased with the progress we've made so far.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">While we increased capital, we also continue to bring down our long-term debt, reducing it by $53 billion in the second quarter through both maturities as well as liability management actions that we\u2019ll get into throughout the presentation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Likewise, we made progress on expenses, which declined $2.1 billion from the first quarter, of which approximately $900 million was due to the absence of an annual retirement eligible stock-based compensation awards that impacted the first quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">As we said last quarter, while revenue growth correlates in large part with the health of the overall economy, the two areas that we clearly have the ability to control are our expenses as well as our debt cost, and we aggressively addressed those during the second quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Asset quality also continued to improve in almost all categories. This improvement combined with decreased levels of distressed loans drove provision expense to be its lowest level going all the way back to the first quarter of 2007.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Interest rates did continue to be a headwind. And as you can see, the decrease in loans and rates during the quarter did negatively affect net interest income. The European crisis and seasonality are impacting the markets related businesses, driving those revenues lower compared to the first quarter of 2012. However, non-interest income did reflect improved results in some of our consumer businesses, which we\u2019ll get into as we go through the presentation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">If you turn to slide six, as we look at regulatory capital under Basel 1, you can see that $2.5 billion of earnings along with a $27 billion decline in risk-weighted assets or about 2.3% of risk-weighted assets drove the capital improvement from 10.78% at the end of the first quarter to 11.24% at the end of the second quarter. If you look at the left hand chart since June of 2011, one year ago, our Basel 1 Tier 1 common ratio has increased by approximately 300 basis points.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Turning to slide seven and providing a Basel 3 update, as we near the 2013 implementation period for Basel 3, we\u2019ve estimated our Tier 1 common equity ratio and its components to provide a better understanding of where we are relative to the Basel 3 guidelines that will be fully implemented at the beginning of 2019. The estimate we provide here is for BIS Basel 3 guidelines in the final U.S. market risk rules. If we reported Basel 3 as of June 30<sup> </sup>on a fully phased-in basis, we estimate that Tier 1 common equity ratio would be 8.1%, we estimate that our Tier1 common equity would be approximately a $127 billion, while our risk-weighted assets would be $1.566 trillion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">As we think about the important differences between Basel 1 and Basel 3 capital or the numerator, the differences include capital deductions related to the MSR, our deferred tax assets and the inclusion of unrealized gains and losses on debt and equity securities recognized in other comprehensive income. As you are well aware, these items will be impacted by future changes in both interest rates as well as overall earnings performance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We turn to slide eight on funding and liquidity, you can see that long-term debt during the quarter was down $53 billion, while our overall Global Excess Liquidity Sources only declined by $28 billion to $378 billion at the end of the quarter. At the parent company, long-term debt during the quarter came down by approximately $40 billion. That $40 billion reduction was approximately $34 billion of parent company maturities, of which we call out $24 billion of that related to TLGP debt. At the end of June, all of our TLGP related debt has been repaid.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In addition to the maturities, we brought in about $5.5 billion through liability management actions on our TRUPs and subordinated debt that are outstanding. The benefit in the quarter from that was a little over $500 million. As we look forward, those liability management actions will result in net interest income savings of approximately $100 million in 2012 and $180 million in 2013.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">As we look at parent company liquidity, it remained very strong at $111 billion at the end of the quarter. And as we look at time to required funding, we finished the quarter at 37 months; the highest in the company\u2019s history.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">During the quarter, we didn\u2019t issue any long-term unsecured parent company debt and I doubt that we will do so during the balance of 2012. What we will continue to do is to bring down long-term debt both by paying off debt at maturity as well as active liability management, consistent with our overall goals of continuing to optimize net interest income.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In fact, we\u2019ve already announced calls of another $5.2 billion in both TRUPs and sub debt, which we expect to complete during the third quarter of this year. In addition to these calls, maturities of $23 billion, of which approximately $15 billion at the parent, will come due during the second half of the year, which will also help reduce both long-term debt balances as well as associated interest expenses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">I\u2019ll spend a minute on page nine, on a couple balance sheet highlights. You can see, total assets were down about 1% to $2.16 trillion while total risk-weighted assets were down over 2% to about $1.19 trillion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Our tangible common equity ratio improved 25 basis points in the quarter from 6.58% to 6.83%. Intangible book value improved by $0.35 during the quarter to $13.22 from $12.87.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We turn to slide 10 and look at net interest income on an FTE basis. It was $9.8 billion during the quarter, down $1.3 billion from the first quarter. The decrease in the quarter was primarily due to higher premium amortization expense associated with FAS 91 as well as market related hedge ineffectiveness. If you recall, rates rose in the first quarter of this year and that led to lower premium amortization and favorable hedge ineffectiveness that benefited NII by about $400 million in the first quarter of this year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">However, lower rates in the second quarter had a negative impact of approximately $500 million, which resulted in a combined negative impact of approximately $900 million to NII from the first quarter to the second quarter. If we back out those market related swings, net interest income decreased by approximately $400 million during the quarter due to lower loan balances and yields and lower trading net interest income, which was partially offset by the benefit of the lower long-term debt that I just mentioned.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In the near term given long and rate levels at the end of June, we estimate that quarterly net interest income will start at a base of approximately $10.25 billion before the impact from liability management actions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Second quarter parent debt maturities and liability actions plus third quarter announced redemptions and calls will benefit quarterly interest income by approximately $300 million, of which $60 million was captured in the second quarter of this year. To state the obvious, if rates increase from the end of June, it will have a positive impact and obviously lower rates would have a negative impact.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We turn to page 11 and look at overall loan activity, total loans for the quarter declined by approximately $10 billion from the first quarter or about 1%. If you look at the composition of the loan balances, you can see ending commercial loans actually grew by about $4.1 billion or 1.3% from the first quarter of 2012. That growth was attributed to increases in our commercial and industrial loans and was partially offset by about a $1.4 billion reduction in commercial real estate. If you go to the bottom of slide 11, you can see ending consumer loans declined approximately $14 billion from the first quarter of 2012.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">I\u2019d like to spend a minute on that. If you go and look at the bar chart, we\u2019ve talked throughout the last couple of quarters about run-off portfolios that we\u2019re looking to run-off that do not produce any meaningful level of pretax income, you can see we had about $4.4 billion of that during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In addition, residential mortgages were down about $4.4 billion. Keep in mind, as we look at those mortgage portfolios, we can either invest in mortgages or securities, and during the quarter we came up in securities, a little bit down in loans. Over and above that about $3.4 billion of loan sales that had been targeted that wrapped up at the beginning of the second quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">If you back those three items out and look at consumer loans on a net basis, that leaves us with about a $2 billion reduction during the quarter or well below 1%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On slide 12, we highlight the results of the Consumer and Business Banking segment. Earnings were $1.2 billion, a decrease from the first quarter, driven by lower net interest income, lower reserve releases and higher litigation expense, partially offset by higher non-interest income. Non-interest income did increase from the first quarter due to a couple of factors; our consumer spending including higher interchange, the gain on certain card portfolios and the impact of our consumer protection products.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On slide 13, we list some key indicators for our Consumer and Business Banking for the quarter. average deposit balance growth was strong, increasing by over 2% or $10 billion compared to the first quarter of 2012. As we continue to focus on cost and look to optimize our delivery network, our branch count came down by 57 branches during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As far as card purchase activity, combined credit and debit card purchase volumes increased 6% from the first quarter of 2012. In addition, credit quality continued to improve as the U.S. credit loss rate is the lowest since the fourth quarter of 2007, while the 30-plus day delinquency rate is at historic lows.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As we look at activity levels within the segment, we\u2019ve also continued to increase our mobile banking customer base to more than 10 million customers, which is a 6% increase from the prior quarter and up 34% from the year-ago period.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We turn to slide 14, Consumer Real Estate Services reported a loss of $768 million, which was an improvement of $377 million versus the first quarter of this year. Lower revenue was more than offset by lower expenses and a lower provision for credit losses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">The Home Loans business within our Consumer Real Estate Services segment recorded a profit of $241 million for the quarter. First mortgage retail originations of $18 billion were up 18% over the first quarter due to lower rates and HARP Refis and in line with our retail originations a year ago.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">However, as you all know, we exited the corresponded business late last year, so current correspondent originations during the quarter are virtually non-existent versus volumes of approximately $22 billion a year ago. Even with the exit from this correspondent channel, core production income is higher than a year ago.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Results for the quarter include $395 million in costs for representations and warranties provision and $109 million of litigation expenses and expected assessments, waivers and other cost related to foreclosure delays.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">During the quarter, our MSR asset decreased by approximately $1.9 billion due to lower mortgage rates and ended the quarter at $5.7 billion. MSR hedge results for the quarter largely offset market valuation declines and the capitalized MSR rate at the end of the quarter was 47 basis points versus 58 basis points in the first quarter and 78 basis points a year ago.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">If we move forward to slide 15, as we've done before, we show some comparisons of certain metrics in our Legacy Assets and Servicing basis on a linked quarter basis, and compared to second quarter a year ago is we continue to focus and work very hard on reducing delinquent loans, and looking to find homeowner solutions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As you recall, Legacy Assets and Servicing reflects all of our servicing operations, and the results of our MSR activities. We added almost 1700 people in the quarter, including contractors versus 3000 people in this area in the first quarter alone.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">The number of first-liens serviced did decline by 5% in the quarter, while the number of 60-day plus delinquent loans dropped 2%. As we think about that drop in 60-day plus delinquent loans of 27,000 loans from the first quarter, it was lower than we would have expected for two reasons. The first is a result of the DOJ/AG Settlement, we have holds on loans that were attempting to modify, and in addition to that we had approximately 15,000 loans were servicing is being sold, but we won't complete until this month. Even with these delays, we continue to believe, we can reduce our 60-day plus delinquencies by a net of approximately 300,000 over the next 12 months.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">And as we've talked about before, we remain very focused on decreasing these loans because on a lag basis it gives us the ability to further reduce costs within this segment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On slide 16, you can see that outstanding claims have increased from the end of March from a rep and warranty perspective. Claims from the GSEs increased as a result of ongoing disagreements with Fannie Mae about what constitutes a valid repurchase request. Through June, there\u2019s been minimal monoline activity consistent with the past six quarters. However, as I\u2019m sure many of you saw, last night we did sign a settlement with Syncora that would have reduced our outstanding monoline claims at the end of June by approximately 20%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On the private-label side, we did have an increase in outstanding claims from $4.9 billion to $8.6 billion during the quarter. The increase in claims is primarily due to claims received from trustees that we fully anticipated at the time of the Bank of New York settlement a year-ago, and were largely reflected in the increase in our reserves at that time. As we look forward, we expect these outstanding claims to continue to grow as the process for ultimate resolution continues to evolve and does remain unclear.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">As you look at this table, I think it\u2019s important to keep in mind that the table reflects unpaid principal amounts as opposed to actual losses that are projected on the loans. Our reserves for rep and warrants ended the quarter at $15.9 billion, up slightly from the prior quarter. And as you look out, our non-GSE range of possible loss over and above existing levels is up to $5 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">In Global Wealth and Investment Management on slide 17; earnings for the quarter of $543 billion or a pre-tax margin of 20% were in line with the results we saw in the first quarter of this year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Solid long-term AUM flows, as well as loan growth of $2.5 billion in the quarter helped to offset a 2% decline in client balances, driven by lower market balances. Loans within this segment are record levels and our advisor levels remained essentially flat, up just slightly from the first quarter of this year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">If we move to Global Banking on slide 18, net income decreased $1.4 billion from the first quarter, due to lower net interest income, as well as lower reserve reductions during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Average loans for the quarter were down 3% as a result of the decreases in commercial real estate that I have spoken about before, as well as certain targeted loan sales. Average deposits increased to $239 billion during the quarter, as our corporate customers continue to remain very liquid.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Asset quality for the quarter continue to improve substantially as we had the largest quarterly percentage reduction since the peak in 2009, in both non-performing assets, as well as credit size balances.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">As you can see on slide 19, investment banking fees for the quarter firm wide, excluding self-led deals were $1.1 billion down slightly from the first quarter as a pick up in M&amp;A activity was more than offset by a decline in both debt and equity underwriting fees.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We were ranked number two globally, as well as in the U.S. in net investment banking fees during the first half of 2012. And as you look at the mix in the geography of the revenues you can see that during the quarter more than 80% of the fees were driven by activity in the U.S. and Canada. If we switch to global markets on slide 20, net income of $462 million decreased to $336 million from the first quarter reflecting lower sales and trading activity, which was partially offset by lower expenses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Total revenue ex-DVA was down $2.1 billion from the first quarter and down $769 million from the second quarter a year ago, due primarily to the European crisis as our clients became more risk averse. Expenses were down both from the first quarter driven by lower personal related expense, as well as from a year ago.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Average VaR was $63 million in the quarter, down from $84 million in the first quarter, due to lower levels of client activity. Continuing with the global market segment on slide 21, we recorded DVA losses of a $156 million in the quarter versus losses of $1.4 billion in the first quarter of this year in gains of a $123 million in the year ago period.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Sales and trading revenue, excluding DVA losses decreased $1.9 billion from the first quarter, due to the deteriorating market sentiment that I just mentioned, as well as a slowing U.S. economy. FICC revenue, ex-DVA was $2.6 billion during the quarter, down $1.6 billion from the first quarter as we experienced decreases in almost all product categories, but we\u2019d also point out that if we compare Q2 of this year to Q2 of last year, FICC revenues were basically flat in the year ago period. In equities, ex-DVA results decreased 26% from the first quarter as volumes remain at low levels, significantly impacting both trading, as well as commission revenue.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On slide 22, we show you the results of All Other. Recall in all, All Other, we include global principal investments to non-US consumer card business, our discretionary portfolio associated with interest rate risk management, insurance and a discontinued real-estate portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">The revenue increase we saw from the first quarter was due to a lower negative valuation adjustment on structured viabilities under fair value option and was offset in part by lower equity investment income, lower gains on sales of debt securities, and lower gains on debt and trust preferred repurchases during the quarter. The decline in non-interest expense was mainly due to the absence of retirement eligible stock based compensation awards that we have in the first quarter of each year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">If you turn to slide 23 and look at expenses, you can see in the upper left hand corner in the red bars that we\u2019ve had significant declines in non-interest expense from the second quarter of 2011, as well as on a linked-quarter basis from the first quarter of 2012. What we\u2019ve done in the grey bars is back out goodwill impairment, as well as the annual retirement eligible comp cost that we have during the first quarter, and if you back those out, you can see once again expenses declining from $20.3 billion in the second quarter last year to $18.2 billion during the first quarter of this year, down to $17 billion during the current quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">I would note during the current quarter, litigation expense embedded in that $17 billion is approximately $1 billion. As we look at the reasons for the decline on a linked-quarter basis in non-interest expense, three major drivers; lower incentive compensation expense, the benefits of our new BAC programs, as well as lower mortgage-related costs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">If you move to the right and look at our full-time equivalents within the employee base, you can see year-over-year ex-legacy assets and servicing our number of employees has come down from 253,000 to 233,000 or an 8% decline. While we\u2019re on the topic of expenses, let me spend just a moment on taxes. The tax rate for the quarter was approximately 22%, which resulted from the impact of our recurring tax preference items on the level of pretax earnings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We estimate 22% to be the rate for the rest of the year except for any unusual items that may arise. As we mentioned last quarter, one unusual item that we do expect to be in active later this month is the UK tax rate reduction of 2%, which should result in a tax charge in the third quarter of approximately $800 million. And recall, due to our current DTA disallowance that charge will not impact our Basel 1 or phased-in Basel 3 Tier-1 ratios.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">If we turn to slide 24, as we\u2019ve talked about previously, our Phase 2 evaluations began late last year and we completed those in the second quarter. As you know, Phase 2 focused on our corporate, commercial, and markets based businesses. We expect that these Phase 2 cost savings will total approximately $3 billion on an annualized basis, which would be fully phased-in by mid-2015. We did start to see some of these Phase 2 savings in the second quarter as these initiatives aren\u2019t as interdependent as the consumer businesses in Phase 1 are.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">With respect to Phase 1, we\u2019re still on track to exceed the 20% of the $5 billion in annual cost savings by the end of 2012. In total, in both Phase 1 and Phase 2, we\u2019re targeting to produce annualized cost savings of approximately $8 billion by mid-2015. So if you consider the lower expected FTEs and other expense reductions associated with new BAC, both Phase 1 as well as Phase 2 along with an improving delinquent mortgage loans servicing pool. we believe we can continue to realize cost savings for the remainder of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">If we switch to asset quality on slide 25; overall trends continue to remain very positive. Provision expense declined $645 million to $1.8 billion. net charge-offs decreased $430 million or 11% to $3.6 billion versus the first quarter driven by lower consumer charge-offs, while commercial charge-offs were relatively flat.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">The reserve reduction was $1.85 billion versus $1.6 billion in the first quarter of the year. As we go forward and as credit continues to stabilize, we would expect that our overall reserve reductions will continue albeit it at significantly reduced levels. Consequently, we believe that provision expense for the next two quarters of the year will be higher than what we experienced during the second quarter of this year, but below that which we saw during the first quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So with that, let me turn it over to Brian to go through how we continue to focus moving forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Thank you, Bruce. Let me add a few thoughts before we take questions. The results you see in our numbers today showed that we are continuing to be well positioned to keep building on the customer and client relationships that we have in our company.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">As we think about our individuals and business we service as clients, many of them have addressed all the financial circumstances that they faced over the last few years and actually are in better shape than a broader economy and the statistics may reflect on a given day or week.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">However, there remain some uncertainty in the markets and in the minds of our customers and clients. This largely revolves around the situations in Europe and United States around the longer-term fiscal issues that must be dealt with. And we continue to run our company consistent with that uncertainty and everything we do.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">If you think about the past, we've been on for the last couple of years, rebuilding the balance sheet, making the strategic decisions, but in our operating principles in place and living up to them and driving our customer focus strategy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Everything as we've done in our company has been achieved to make our company less complex and more streamline, and also to position our company better to grow over time. But this quarter continues to demonstrate as a sound financial foundation we have built. The strong balance sheet that we\u2019ve built and will continue to maintain. And because of all the work the opportunities, which we are focused on is now to drive the core earnings of the company.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">As we discussed at the beginning of the year, we laid out four things that we were focused upon. We told you we\u2019d focus on improving our capital levels. We told you we\u2019d focus on managing our risk. We told you we\u2019d focus on reducing our cost base, and we told you, we\u2019d focus on driving core business improvements. This quarter, we saw improvements in each of these areas. On capital, we continue to make strong progress and feel good about where we stand especially in light of our Basel 3 guidance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">In a years time we go on from being behind our peers to being ahead of our peers. If you think about the risk side, asset quality trends continue to be positive across the board. Charge-offs continue to fall and has room to go. Provision expense is at the lowest level we\u2019ve had in this company in five years. Delinquency trends continue to improve in all our products and criticized commercial exposures continue to fall.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">As we think about the cost side, we are starting to see the benefits of new BAC program. And the results of that Phase 2 work will begin to roll through as well. This is evident in the reduction in head count and expenses that you see in the numbers. So let\u2019s remember this, as we reduce our costs, we continue to invest in the opportunities on our franchise. We invest in technology over $2 billion or $3 billion a year, this year. For example that investment is in May, we completed a major technology milestone for our company converting our California franchise. So for the first time in our company\u2019s history, we now have one deposit platform serving customers coast to coast.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">In addition, we continue to invest in our technology platforms across the world, including our cash management platform to service corporate clients and you can see the effect of that in our numbers. But also we invest in our client facing teams. We continue to grow our small business bankers, our wealth management team aids both in our wealth management business in our FSAs and our consumer business. And we will continue to add mortgage loan officers as you can see in our increased production.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So we\u2019ve had strong steady progress on capital risk and cost, providing solid foundation as we focus our energy on a core business growth and the earnings power of the company. This is the area that we continue to have work to do, as you can see in the numbers, but we put ourselves in a position to be success. For example, we have transformed and repositioned our core consumer business, we\u2019re taking the core expenses down, we continue to drive growth.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">The example that Bruce referenced earlier is our mobile banking platform. We had 10.3 million customers this quarter in that mobile banking platform, up 600,000 from the last quarter. With the usage of that platform and the payments initiate, it\u2019s growing very, very quickly. This is a superior service model that is second to none in the industry.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">In our consumer business, our deposit balances were up, new credit card accounts were up. For example, we\u2019d issued 1.4 million BankAmericard Cash Rewards cards since we had introduced them less than a year-ago; that\u2019s 26,000 new cards a week. Our mortgage production has increased almost 20% quarter-over-quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">In a broader context, we\u2019ve extended $107 billion in credit to our customers to help them participate in the economy this quarter. In the important small business area, year-to-date, we\u2019ve initiated $4 billion of new credit to small businesses. So we continue to drive businesses across the board, whether it\u2019s in our wealth management business as you can see in the good long-term asset under management flows or in the banking product side, where you can see loans have achieved record levels.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">We have market coverage and penetration second to none in the commercial areas, whether it\u2019s large corporations or medium and small businesses. We brought the Wall Street capabilities to those clients across our franchise. And from an institutional investor client base, you\u2019ve seen in our trading business the core customer focus and how that continues to improve recurring revenue streams and also you can see our research capabilities that our clients tell us are second to none.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So now we have tremendous opportunities and franchise, we all know that, hence we continue to focus on the execution. As such, what you can expect out of us over the next few quarters, continue to build the momentum around business performance, continue to focus on the fundamentals, stronger capital, capital management of risk and reducing costs and you\u2019ll see us drive forward and deliver the results that you, our clients, customers and shareholders expect.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thank you. And now we\u2019re happy to take questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p8\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions) and with that, we can take our first question from the site of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John E. McDonald \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yes, hi, good morning. Bruce, on the net interest income, I just want to clarify your statement that you said that starting point should be the $10.2 billion, is that the adjusted NII from this quarter or is that why you referencing it tend to?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">That\u2019s correct, John.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John E. McDonald \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And then, from there, are you saying we should add the incremental 240 benefit from their reductions?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">That\u2019s correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John E. McDonald \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And then what about kind of the core leakage, like this quarter you had that $400 million of core leakage from the loan run-off. You didn\u2019t mention that, but do you expect to still have that battling against that benefit?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I mean I think as we think about the $10.25 billion, that\u2019s the jumping off point. we clearly, and I think you\u2019ve seen us in the commercial area, are clearly looking within the context of a reasonable risk appetite to start driving loan growth going forward. and as we\u2019ve talked about before that the run-off portfolio is not one that\u2019s particularly profitable. so as we look forward and as we\u2019ve thought about that jumping off point, that\u2019s how we think about the $10.25 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John E. McDonald \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. And just trying to think of once we jump off, is there something about the $400 million that was elevated this quarter in terms of core leakage and why that might slow as just is loan shrinkage slowing, is that the idea?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">That\u2019s the idea. I mean I think the other thing is that and as I\u2019d mentioned in my comments and we\u2019ve talked about rates going up or down. While we\u2019re not predictors of interest rates per say, we clearly would not expect to see the decline in interest rates from the rate that we saw from the end of the first quarter to the end of the second quarter going forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John E. McDonald \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. And then just finally, how would the hedge and the premium amortization work, given where the tenure is today versus where it ended at the second quarter? Would that be an incremental hurt and would it be similar magnitude or less?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">That obviously goes both ways, both up and down. I think if you look at where the tenure was at the end of the quarter, I believe it was at about $164 million. So we\u2019re clearly a little bit lower today than we were at the end of the quarter. I would expect though that if rates were to continue to go down, I\u2019m not sure that you would necessarily see the same impact on the downside for premium amortization because at some point, it is going to stop.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John E. McDonald \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. So it would be down but not by the same magnitude on the hedge effectiveness and the premium amortization?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">That would be the expectation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John E. McDonald \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. And then on the expenses, it sounds like you think the $17 billion is a good jumping off point for expenses all in and you expect to decline for the rest of the year from there. Is that what you said?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John E. McDonald \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. And then on the Phase 2 done by 2015, am I correct that the Phase 2 stage were supposed to come faster than the Phase 1, is that still the expectation?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yes, when we put out the Phase 1 expectations, we obviously said it was roughly 20% by the end of the first year, and given as I\u2019ve said, a lot of the work is not as interdependent, you would expect that those Phase 2 savings to come more on a ratable type basis as opposed to having them a little bit a more back-end loaded.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John E. McDonald \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. But given that those are coming by mid-2015, obviously the Phase 1 takes longer than mid-2015 to finish up?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">No, because keep in mind, the Phase 1, we have talked about a three-year period and having all of the Phase 1s done by the end of 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Remember, because Phase 1 was started much earlier.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John E. McDonald \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay, got it, got it. Okay, so it's not from today, and someone has started, okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">That's correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John E. McDonald \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And then the last thing, just the operating expenses and LAS were up to 2.7% from 2.4%, do you believe that those have peaked now and do you see those starting to decline in the second half of this year or more in 2013?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">John, I think, they are up a little bit, because remember we\u2019re now in full multiple things going on in Department of Justice to look back in full swing in everything. So the team thinks we've largely peaked, but I\u2019d expect to be slowly start to move in the right direction. But I think the next quarter, I wouldn't expect them to come down a lot, just because we\u2019re still finishing up for the third and fourth quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">But once we get through the Department of Justice look back, once we get a settlement work, once we get through the look back, there are a lot of expenses will come out relatively quickly, and in according to line, loan numbers go down. But I think we peaked, but I think it\u2019ll take us as we enter early next year when you start to see meaningful quarter-by-quarter improvement.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John E. McDonald \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. So the decline from 17 in the back half of this year is more from the New BAC stuff, would you say?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yeah, I think if you look at that chart on headcount, John, that Bruce showed you in the upper right hand corner, just watch the quarter-by-quarter toward trend and you can see that from a broad franchise, ABS and LAS were down 20,000 people year-over-year, and 3000 this quarter overcoming an increase in LAS. And so you\u2019ve just seen it come through quarter by quarter by quarter, so we\u2019re still driven largely this year by the non-LAS, and the LAS will help probably more in 2013.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John E. McDonald \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Got it, okay. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And our next question is from the site of Paul Miller with FBR. Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Paul J. Miller \u2013 FBR Capital Markets &amp; Co</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yeah, I thank you very much. Hey Brian, can you help us on slide 16, a follow-up question on the, you said the 8.6 private label that settlement last night, settled 20% of that or roughly $1.7 billion?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yeah, we said so. If you look at the, that\u2019s correct that the under monolines, as you look at the dollar of claims, it was roughly 20%. I think, Paul, though that the other thing to keep in mind is that, when you look at the monolines, some of the exposure is included within the claims, and with respect to certain other monolines, it\u2019s within the litigation number. But you\u2019re correct that with respect to this [in-quarter] settlement, it was 20% of the outstanding claims in the\u2026</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Paul J. Miller \u2013 FBR Capital Markets &amp; Co</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Of the monolines, of the monolines?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yeah, yeah, you said private improves at monolines, but the monolines aren\u2019t.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Paul J. Miller \u2013 FBR Capital Markets &amp; Co</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yeah, I had it wrong. And then the other question is, is like the private, I mean the GSE, reps and warrant put-backs continues to grow, and I agree with you that after 25 statements, you shouldn\u2019t asked to pay any reps and warrants, but how is this going to be settled? Will the GSEs go to court, have they gone to court? I don\u2019t think you\u2019re in dialog with them, I know you\u2019ll probably don\u2019t make a comment about that, but how can we look at this as analyst? How would this be eventually settled, would you have to go to court?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I think Paul, I would just reiterate your point and I think if you look back on slide 33, and look at the new claim trends that are coming in from the GSEs, it\u2019s very clear that the new trends that are building up in that bucket were back in the 2006, 2007 vintages. And so I think we clearly have a disagreement and the way that it gets result is obviously through one of two ways, either they would look to bring an action or alternatively there would be a settlement. But those would be the two ways that it would get resolved.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Paul J. Miller, FBR Capital Markets &amp; Co.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. Go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Well, if you look on those pages, you can see that there are approved repurchases going through in quarters. So there\u2019s a pattern, which thinks we are still paying if any today, on once we believe we owe one.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Paul J. Miller, FBR Capital Markets &amp; Co.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">But you\u2019re paying on those that are less than two years of payments, right? The disagreements coming about on those loans have made over 25 payments, right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yeah, we\u2019re paying on the ones that are consistent with our past belief that we\u2019re owing the money, and leave aside the payment exactly but it\u2019s really that we\u2019re owing the money or not.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Paul J. Miller, FBR Capital Markets &amp; Co.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. And thank you very much gentlemen.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And we turn to our next question from the site of Glenn Schorr with Nomura. Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Glenn Schorr \u2013 Nomura Securities International Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thank you. A quick one, the Basel 3, 8.1% that you showed, correct me if I\u2019m wrong, it includes 2.5%, but not the NPR. I\u2019m just curious on why you took that road and what your estimate? I might be using the standardized approach.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Sure. That\u2019s correct, Glenn. And I think as we look at the NPR, obviously there\u2019s a comment period, there\u2019s a lot of clarification and qualification needs to get baked in. We\u2019ve done the work and based on our understanding, realizing it\u2019s a draft and there's going to be a lot of comments, we think the negative effect would be around 15 basis points, but I think we\u2019re just hesitant to including the number until there\u2019s exact clarity and the different clarifications get made and the rules become a little bit more clear.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Glenn Schorr \u2013 Nomura Securities International Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay, that\u2019s all we really needed, just to get that range, that\u2019s helpful. And then on the, just curious, I don\u2019t know if I missed it in the prepared remarks, but I think the private label claims spiked by like 77%, I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s a single private label holder or what\u2019s closed that spike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yeah, I think it\u2019s a series of holders. And I think the one thing that I think is important to take a step back and when you think about these private label claims is that when we set up the reserves and entered into the settlement at the end of the second quarter of last year, we obviously established both reserves and range of possible loss with the anticipation that we would see increased claim activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And I think as you look at these private label claims, I think that it\u2019s important to think of a couple of things. The first is they\u2019re notional amounts. The second thing is if you look at the losses that tend to be associated with those notional amounts, they\u2019re roughly $0.60 on the dollar of what the notional amounts are. So if you take that $8 billion number that\u2019s come in and think about it in the context of $0.60, it gets you down to a number of roughly $5 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And then you can take the settlement data that we\u2019ve had out there, if you wanted to look at a Gibbs &amp; Bruns type settlement number off of collateral losses, and if you apply that to that number, you get something that\u2019s well below $1 billion dollars. And obviously as we go through the process and set up both reserves and range of possible loss, we factor in the data that you see there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Glenn Schorr \u2013 Nomura Securities International Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Very helpful, I appreciate that. Last one is a quickie. There was nothing in the Q, the past Q on LIBOR. I know it\u2019s a sticky situation, but is there any, I think you only said LIBOR in U.S. dollars, if that\u2019s correct, I\u2019m just curious, if you can update us on anything related to that issue now?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yeah, I mean I think, obviously, all of you have seen the different press reports and that you\u2019re aware that we\u2019re a panel bank, not unlike others, we\u2019ve received and are cooperating with the enquiries that we get from both the U.S. and the foreign regulators. We\u2019re also one of the number of defendants in some of the other LIBOR related litigation. And just given the fact that these are active matters, there\u2019s really not a lot more than we can say than that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Glenn Schorr \u2013 Nomura Securities International Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay, thanks for answering the questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">We\u2019ll go next to the site of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Matthew D. O'Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Good morning. If I could just follow-up a little bit on the net interest income commentary, I guess first, when you talk about the jumping off point, the $10.25 billion, I guess I\u2019m trying to think why it\u2019s not the $10.5 billion roughly including some of the liability management, and then from there, we\u2019ve got to make adjustments up or down for loans, securities and interest rate environment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I think you\u2019re saying the same thing slightly differently than we did, which is that the $10.25 billion is generally where we were at in the second quarter adjusted for that activity. And you\u2019re right, going forward, there should be an incremental $240 million a quarter that would get added to that and then plus or minus whatever you see in balance levels in rate movement. So we said it slightly differently, but you\u2019re right, you can look at it the way that you just articulated as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Matthew D. O'Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. And then taking out the accounting new answers of premium amortization hedge, the market related hedge ineffectiveness, I guess we just think about the core portfolio and some of the re-pricing that you might see in your securities book if rates stay here, I mean I would assume there\u2019s just kind of some natural drag to the core NIM, if rates would stay here that we would expect?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I think you almost needed to look at it portfolio-by-portfolio, obviously the securities portfolios are subject to rates either going up or down from here. I think if you go back and look at the different card portfolios that the actual rates on the card portfolios have been pretty sticky where they are. And obviously beyond just NIM, as you go down to the pretax line, we\u2019re benefiting from credit improvement within the card business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And then I would say, if you look at and go through some of the commercial and corporate loan pricing that I would characterize that environment is generally pretty stable at this point. So to your point as far as where do you see and is there downward pressure going forward, I think it\u2019s going to be more a function of both loan balances as well as where rates go from here more than anything else.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Matthew D. O'Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. And then I guess you\u2019re not the only bank, but like a number of banks have kind of brushed off the low rate impact on the securities book. And I know it takes time for the securities portfolio to re-price, but if we adjust your yield [forcing to] one-time or it seems like it\u2019s around 2.8%, and my guess is the stuff that you\u2019re adding is 1.5% to 1.7% right now. So, I mean hypothetically if rates stay here, it\u2019s just kind of constantly down to that, right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I think what it says is that as we look out at and I think if you go back to last year, we could see and I think as we looked out, we\u2019re pretty close to exit the FAS 91 and the premier amor being pretty close to where we thought NII would land. And what I\u2019d say at this point is that I think all other things being equal in this environment, obviously there's a little bit of pressure downward on that. I think the other thing though and clearly what we\u2019re looking to do and working real hard to mitigate and hopefully improve where we\u2019re from a net interest perspective is the debt footprint.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And I think as you look out, at the parent we've got roughly $15 billion of maturities during the balance of the year, and we\u2019ll look to clearly offset to the extent that that pressure exist, work real hard to continue to shrink the debt footprint, because we\u2019re paying roughly $2.5 billion a quarter on that long-term debt footprint, and obviously one of the things that\u2019s in our control is to continue to shrink that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Matthew D. O'Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. And then just separate topic briefly here. Obviously there's a lot of cost savings coming from New BAC, probably another $7 billion or so versus what's in the run rate now, the legacy mortgage costs could come down. You\u2019ve said and we\u2019ve estimated maybe $8 billion annually. So I mean these are really big numbers off of your expense space. Are there any modest offsets, like ramp-ups in investment stance or some of the growth initiatives you've talked about in the commercial, anything in those areas that we should be factoring in?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I think, so think about the markets business, so the revenues in the compensation will follow that, so being careful to, if always adjust that to what you think it is. But outside of that, we're, for example, we\u2019d invest about $3 billion in technology development this year, about $750 million of that will go to New BAC implementation, which is going through the run rate. And as that comes off, we\u2019ll turn that $750 million level back to the core businesses. So embedded and that is what is shifting money around even something like that to help drive the business growth.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So of course, if you look in core consumer, you\u2019d see expenses are flattish when it does the litigation quarter-to-quarter. That's because that business is putting on loan officers and putting on FSAs and putting on preferred bankers in the preferred growth area of the business, while in the mass market, the retail businesses were bringing it down.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So I think you\u2019re seeing those investments go on in the business. and so we\u2019re taking advantage of those opportunities, our marketing dollars, we\u2019re careful with them, but we continue to watch them and trim them. but we\u2019re getting rid of a lot of expense that is just coming from the overall reposition of the company including real estate expenses, and things like that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So there\u2019s enough room to invest and embed it in the way we did New BAC is to at least a couple of years of growth capacity that we have left in there to assume an economy, which is bumping around at 2%, 2.5% type of growth. So I think we\u2019re comfortable that you won\u2019t see a big offset to it in that context.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">When you go to the markets business, we built the international platform out. We\u2019ll always take opportunities to add people where opportunity is, but even on the international, we brought that back a little bit, because the fees available and the training process available were down. So I\u2019m not overly concerned about the reinvestment rate within the businesses, there\u2019s money in there. so you should think a lot of that is only coming through today net of the implementation costs, which that we can reposition.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Matthew D. O'Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And we can go next to the site of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Hi, good morning, thanks. One follow-up question on the capital, you indicated that Basel 3 proposals, if we put them all, it would be a 15 basis point hit, lots of caveats around the fact that we need more clarification. I guess I\u2019m wondering is that on an advanced basis or standardized basis?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">That would be on a, assuming all model approval. So it's going to be on an advanced basis, which I think from everything that we've seen best, I think we clearly believe that will be our governor.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. And so, and then the standardized rate with the (inaudible), when you have to disclose whichever is lower, will the standardized have an impact there or no?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I think, yeah from everything we\u2019re seeing at this point, clearly the advanced approach is going to be our governor. So as you look at the different rules assume were advanced.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">The sales I remember, when we\u2019re saying fully phased-in, we are still deducting the entire DTA in terms of the calculations as of today. And by time those rules we really face, and we'll run that back overtime. So there are other adjustments, which where you\u2019re making this adjustments on this side, we agree with you, but there \u2013 the fully phased-in axis of the rules were there fully implemented and its still five to six years out. And so, as you watch us really play out, you'll see some differences in that the reported numbers during time. And we will earn back the DTA and that creates capital faster rate than other one.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Sure. Okay, that's helpful. On page 16, just want to make sure that, I am not sure you are saying about the DOJ/AG is holding on to the loans and then you\u2019ve got this 15,000 loans sourcing, sold that are going to be completed this month. So I just want to make sure I understand how that's going to flow through. And to not only expected declines and delinquencies that's over and above the 300, are you talking about over the next 12 months or that's embedded within?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">No the servicing sales are embedded within that net 300,000 units.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. But then the comments you are making about the DOJ?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yeah, DOJ just as we attempt to modify some of those loans, its slowdown what would have gone through the normal process as we satisfied those obligations. so we look at that as more of a one to two quarter delay, not something that\u2019s permanent, and I think the thing that we just wanted to make sure of is, we\u2019ve spoken publicly before, that as we look out at over the course of the second quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter, first quarter that we were thinking it would be a net 300,000 reduction, we just want to make it clear that over that timeframe, we\u2019re not coming off that guidance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. and then as we think about the LAS expenses, as you\u2019ve indicated a decline and the delinquencies, obviously should be driving down your LAS expenses. When I look at kind of the servicing pools foreclosure to liquidation or pass due to liquidation. I\u2019m not seeing that much of a ramp up yet. Can you just give us some thoughts on what you\u2019re doing to try to ramp that up and when you think that turn is going to happen?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yeah. A couple of things, I think the first thing is that when you look at the expense side, just to keep in mind embedded in these numbers are couple of things that we\u2019ve observed in the second quarter as we go forward. First is obviously as part of the different settlements, we had to staff up and obviously going to single point of contact at the level of expense. The second thing is there are a variety of obligations under the DOJ/AG settlement including getting through the modifications that adds expense, and obviously there are some of the look back and other activities that adds expense. so as you look at those different things from an expense perspective that those are all embedded in the second quarter and it\u2019s why we believe that they will trend down based on the guidance that Brian had given before. I think as it relates to some of the activity as far as the different buckets of getting the number of 60 plus day delinquencies out. I don\u2019t think that there is any question that the second quarter was a little bit slower in those different buckets than we would have expected. At the same time, as we look out at, and as I said over the next couple of quarters, as we see the different pipelines, the different servicing sales and everything else, we\u2019re still quite comfortable with what we\u2019ve communicated before.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. And then last on the DOJ piece, a lot of that review have to be done by the end of this year, can you tell us how much you think the expenses to come down as you move into 1Q \u2013 2Q from those reviews being completed?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Well, I think we said, it will take us throughout the year, so you\u2019ll see more benefits next year in that in terms of them coming down, plus the day-to-day work. You\u2019ve got multiple things going on, you\u2019ve got the DOJ, you\u2019ve got the foreclosure look back which is running through here, and then just getting the inventory down overall. And remember, also that there is a flow in each quarter that we\u2019re \u2013 that you just \u2013 each in this 75,000 to 80,000 new units come in, in the second quarter. So, just from the general delinquency [flaws] of portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So, all that put together, what we\u2019re saying is, for the rest of this year, we are busy getting, that the DOJ behind us getting the work done on the look back and get that behind us, which is very expensive largely not through the personal line, but largely through the out-of-pocket expenses to third-parties to independent foreclosure review. And then you\u2019ll see it start coming down next year more measurably, because those two activities will be completed as you said and then the rest of the balances come down. So, year-over-year will be down 260,000 plus units, remembering that year we probably had 250,000, think about to make 300,000 new units flow in from the delinquency [flaws] of portfolio, so you\u2019ve made a net gain over top of that and that front end flow is slowing down as the portfolio shrinks and the asset quality gets better.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Sure, got that. I just wondered if it was puzzle put a number on the third party payments that you\u2019ve got, sustaining with this review which can end at year end.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">There is nobody working harder to get this number down and we are.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay, thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And we\u2019ll take our next questions from the site of Andrew Marquardt from Evercore Partners. Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt \u2013 Evercore Partners</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Good morning, guy. Just back on capital, so I just want to \u2013 with the capital ratios coming in above what you had targeted for the full year as well. How do we think about, do you have a new target for the end of this year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">We\u2019ve not put out a new target for this year, I think, the things that I would say, as you look at on capital, let\u2019s think about both numerator and denominator, on the numerator side, if you look at us generating net income and given where we are from a DCA prospective, I think generally you can think about the capital number growing in the zip code of one and half times our net income. So you\u2019ve got that benefit and that relates to the tax position that Brian referenced, and unlike some of our other peers, it\u2019s largely in the U.S where we generate income.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Secondly, and I think one of the benefits that we have this quarter that just be aware of is that, obviously as we continue to drive down into self servicing that benefits the MSR, which is the capital benefit, that MSR obviously also bounces around with rates as does OCI. So I think as you think about the numerator, I would think about those different things, and as we look at the denominator and moving forward, I think we still believe that we\u2019ve got a decent bit of runway on the denominator as we go forward both from actual risk reduction things that we continue to do, and as we continue to reduce legacy assets that we believe that there\u2019s upside there. and then secondly, that there\u2019s still a lot of model work that we\u2019re working through that we believe we\u2019ll provide further benefit as we go throughout the end of this year and in to next year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt \u2013 Evercore Partners</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Should we assume that the run-offs portfolios more than offset incremental growth or are they are offsetting out, and how do we think about kind of the overall balance sheet size?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yeah. I think that clearly some of the stuff that runs off, given its nature tends to be higher on the risk rating spectrum. and so, as you think about that amount that runs off for $5 billion, some of that has decent risk ratings associated with that, until we see the actual mix of what we\u2019re able to get and what comes on, it\u2019s probably not appropriate to comment. but we\u2019re obviously mindful, as we look to grow and put assets on of what the different Basel 3 risk ratings are?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt \u2013 Evercore Partners</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Got it, thank you. And then lastly, just back on expenses. Can you help us understand in terms of Phase 1 and Phase 2, $8 billion by mid-15. I just want to understand, with this Phase 1 now, the $5 billion you\u2019ve realized the billion, is that, is there a timing of realization on the same wide tab that it had before, I recall it was going to be coming in sooner kind of by the end of \u201913, but maybe I\u2019m not recollecting correctly?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Yeah. I think a couple of things Andrew. what we would have suddenly came out with New BAC 1, is that, it was $5 billion on an annual basis, it would be fully phased-in by the end of 2014, we said that we\u2019ve realized 20% of that by the end of 2012 and you\u2019re exactly correct that we've subsequently said that we\u2019re ahead of schedule with respect to that 20% by the end of 2012. And as I mentioned earlier, as you think about the New BAC 2, and you think about that $3 billion over the course of the next three years, unlike New BAC 1, I would generally think about that in the buckets of kind of a third, a third, a third in each of the three years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt \u2013 Evercore Partners</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Got it. So just to be clear on that New BAC 1, if 20% is realized in this year, how much should we think about next year, is the bulk of that coming in next year, is that fair?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">We've not provided that guidance or split between the second and third year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Just to be clear, we haven't changed what we said before. We just added it, the 2015 comes attached to Phase 2, and not Phase 1.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt \u2013 Evercore Partners</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">We go next to the site of Jefferson Harralson with KBW. Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Jefferson Harralson \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Hi, thanks. I was going to follow up on some, on the rep and warranty question. Given that we\u2019re not in dialog with Fannie and that the private label seemed to be trying to get their suites in before statue limitations ahead. Should we expect the same types of outstanding claims increase next quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Yeah, I think at this point, we're not going to predict what these claims are or not, because I think you have to keep in mind that first they tend to be lumpy, and the second thing is that, they don't think we want to confuse claims that come in versus those that are valid, but have the ability to come in. But I think with \u2013 as you think about it, and you think about when the underwriting and the originations with respect to these slowdown as we got into 2008, we\u2019re clearly almost four years into that. So, I think generally speaking, your point has to mere, but we\u2019re not going to predict exactly what we\u2019d expect these to be. Besides that that we expected those to increase, we\u2019d continue to see some of those increases in the second quarter, and we\u2019ll see some more going forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Jefferson Harralson \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">All right. And just on a follow-up, is it possible, I\u2019m trying to frame that $6 billion of increase in the outstanding claims, and you give us the net claims every quarter. Is it possible to look at the total claims that you\u2019ve gotten over the cycle and compare that $6 billion of new claims to the total claims? I mean is it, that you\u2019ve gotten, I don\u2019t know, $60 billion of claims, is it a little different or $600 billion of claims, is a different \u2013 is it different growth rate?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I think, if you look at 32 and 33, you can sort of see that we paid out $13.6 billion on page 32, the slides through this quarter that\u2019s actually been paid<strong> </strong>on resolution and these types of things, and then we have reserves established $15.9 billion. And then if you look, I don\u2019t have here in front of us. If you can look at this chart from page 33, we\u2019ve been producing this now for a better year and half, so you can sort of go back and see the claims flows literally quarter-by-quarter going back pretty far.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Jefferson Harralson \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">All right, thanks guys.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">We\u2019ll go next to site of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Great, thanks. Couple of things just on the reps and warrants, Bruce, I understand the idea that you set up the reserve contemplated a<strong> </strong>lot of this. What should we look at from our stand point kind of out here to kind of get the sense that you would need to add to the reserves by this what would have to happen in order for that \u2013 for you need to add to them?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I may think you almost need to go through the three different buckets. We obviously, as we\u2019ve said before believe that the work in a way that we\u2019ve reserved for the GSEs is based on our obligations, and we continue to believe that we\u2019re satisfied with those obligations with perspective of the GSE bucket.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I think second, if you go to the monolines, the deal that we\u2019ve referenced in quarter that we signed up that got done today was in the context of our reserves. So I think in the context of getting that one behind us, it was where the reserves were. And so I guess given that a fair bit of the monolines stuff that\u2019s out there it relates to litigation obviously it\u2019s something from a litigation perspective was different than what we\u2019ve assumed. That would affect it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And then I think third, if you go down to the private-label stuff, you\u2019ve got two different buckets of liability, you\u2019ve got one from the rep and warrant perspective, and obviously if there was different behavior from a claim\u2019s perspective than what we\u2019ve assumed in an outcome that we didn\u2019t anticipate. We have to adjust with that point if the experience was different than what we have assumed.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And then obviously the fourth piece of it is that there is securities litigation that\u2019s out there that we touch on as far as looking at range of possible loss within our litigation bucket. So I think we \u2013 at this point, we\u2019ve got experience, we\u2019ve got the different buckets, and we\u2019ve laid out what those are, and obviously changes from what our assumptions and what our experience is, is what would change that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Great. On the comment that you made about the retail banking platform, now that you are actually on one platform, is it more likely that you will kind of have a new retail banking offering and kind of adjust pricing and try to recapture some of the revenue that\u2019s been lost over the last several years. Any thoughts, you can give on some in that front?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">It\u2019s a combination of everything. but if you look, we\u2019ve sort of passed through all the different regulatory impacts now and you can see \u2013 if you look at the consumer saving, you can see the revenues have stabilized in terms of the fee revenues and start to grow, really good activity at this point, because you\u2019ve now had the impact of the overdraft, and the interchange and everything we have through the core (inaudible) result. and so the team is working on combination of all the factors, driving revenue from the standpoint of loan originations and things like that of the core portfolio, bringing down expenses at 57 range or so whatever we reduce this quarter. and if you look at the people, the headcount in this business is down from a high point, at one point 100,000 down to say 70,000 to give you the sense. And so we continue to reduce that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">So it\u2019s a combination of all things. so we continue to do a new offering, new account structures and something we\u2019ve been testing, we\u2019ve been clear about that. We haven\u2019t made any decisions there and we continue to look at it. but interesting enough this mobile platform growth really has changed some of our thinking there, because the \u2013 for example, we send 20 odd million texts a month to people telling their balances are low, the initiation of payments after mobile platform is about $1 billion a week now, up dramatically year-over-year and continues to grow, and it\u2019s just a much more efficient and frankly, strong service models. So I think it\u2019s going to be, continues to be a combination of expenses in revenue and activity. I\u2019d tell you that the court sales checking accounts were strong this quarter, the account closures by our customers lowest since they\u2019ve been in 2007. so that net attrition rates are down and we keep driving all those different things. So I wouldn\u2019t mean it\u2019s any one thing, but the platform, really the Northwest and the California, because people that we did in the Northwest gives us a much more cheaper platform obviously, but also much more capable platform that we couldn't change things put thing get it into the system. And we continue to look at account structures and making sure we balanced the rates we charged with the value we get.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay, thanks. Just one quick follow-up. Bruce, (inaudible) this already, but did the DTA go down in the quarter or what happen there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">It went down by a small amount.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Small amount, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">We'll go next to the site of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. My question is on LAS first off, the staffing levels there, it seems as though the FTE definition that you guys used in your LAS disclosures bounces around a little bit. I was hoping, you could maybe give some clarity on that, and maybe provide some consistent quarter-over-quarter disclosure over an extended period of time. So we could get a better handle on exactly staffing levels there and what's moving, because it doesn't seem like it just the FTEs plus third party. Can you help out there a little bit?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I think, we think consistently the FTEs that what we count the FTEs, so you could see that what you \u2013 sometimes you hear numbers that are 42,000 and 55,000, the 55,000 are contractors, we have about 10,000 to 12,000, 13,000 contractors working in the given time that are not on our payroll. That we obviously pay through the expense line, and we'll talk about 50,000 plus people working, but the FTE numbers of (inaudible) consistently and we could \u2013 if you look on page 15, you can see some 7,000 employees FTE equivalents from second quarter of 2011, 2012. But the contract that one moves around a little bit based on the ebbs and flows of what we're doing and you should see those come down.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Yeah, but last quarter in your deck you had FTEs at 38.1% and now you are at 42.4%, but you say you are only up 0.3%, so I guess I don\u2019t understand that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">In the last quarter of adjustment there is a group that\u2019s in our core consumer business that does the good mortgage service thing before collections and they\u2019ve moved some people around, so there might be a little bit noise there, but from a core activity level you are seeing that this thing is really around about 55,000 people equivalents, 42,000 with us 13,000 with our people.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay, I guess it will be helpful to see it consistently disclose because I mean, what I am kind of getting at here is, starting at about third quarter of last year, indications were that LAS staffing was out on your peak, but we\u2019ve actually seen the staff always go up every quarter since and I might be not remembering this correctly, but I seem to recall you saying previously that LAS staffing should start to go down in the back half of 2012 previously; and now it seems like you are calling for those declines to be held-off until 2013, so what I\u2019m getting at is, can you give us a sense of your confidence level of these cost projections and maybe how much we should bake in there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay. Let me just make sure and with respect to the staffing levels in what you are looking at, what was adjusted this quarter was the \u2013 within legacy assets servicing there is some non-distress servicing that\u2019s in there that when we reported this segment we adjusted the people that do some of that non-distressed serving in the numbers that\u2019s reflected in the numbers and we\u2019ve gone back and adjusted those numbers to make sure that it\u2019 consisted on a look-back basis, so you\u2019ve got apples-to-apples within these numbers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay, the second is, it relates to the staffing levels, I think what we\u2019ve said this quarter with prospect to the overall expense base and staffing is that we\u2019re wrapping the different parts of the different DOJ/AG and other settlements, and we would start to expect both the people in the expense to go down probably more towards the latter part of the year with significant momentum in 2013.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Okay, and I get \u2013 believe me the business has been really difficult and I\u2019m sure it has been really hard to manage so I can certainly appreciate the challenge is there. I guess it, just the key part of the story is a lot of this expense improvement, and some of the commentary around improvements in 2013, it seems as though, it has been, that\u2019s going to be sort of slow, whereas you get a more substantial pickup in 2014, and I think Brian, you\u2019ve made some of those references in some of the investor presentations what I\u2019ve heard.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">So could you give us maybe a bit more, is it possible to get a bit more specific on, what you\u2019re talking about there? I mean are we talking someone in the ballpark like 10% to 15% reduction in that $8 billion in our X litigation numbers, is it more like a third, is it \u2013 what are we thinking about for 2013 and then 2014 is it possible?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">We\u2019ve given you an overall view point that says that the amount of 60 plus day delinquent loans will ultimately get into the say the 300,000 range that will take us the rest of this year, and next year to get it down into those ranges and probably end of \u201914. Before that we\u2019re saying that it takes about $500 million of quarterly cost versus the [$2.8 you have in your day] and so that\u2019s what we get, the pace of this even six months ago, for example, now closure look back we just got the final rules recently a bad habit finish the work and that was month after we expect it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">So, a lot of it is based on in that case we had to get the final rules to actually go do the work and the Department of Justice, the settlement came through in early April, final settlement. A lot of people believed it would be done a few months before that because it was largely worked out. We couldn\u2019t start the work until the settlement was finalized.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">So many things move around a month or two, but in a grand scheme of things the key is to get this from the $2.8 billion to the $500 million level. And they\u2019re \u2013 in there all the people cost and in there on top of that is some of the effectively each quarter the one-time adjustments, the life expectation, foreclosure delays and things like that, but we adjust on. But I think you will see this come down relatively quickly once we break through the two big bodies of work, and then beginning the Department of Justice settlement work and the look back. And then after that it is really scheduled against the work flow down to the people will come down. And we are working as hard as we can to get it down.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">So I think any adjustment to the view of timing is largely done just to make sure we do it right because the number one thing is to do this right for the consumers continue to modify the $1 million plus loans we\u2019ve modified, continue to work the short step process and other alternative resolutions continue to do all the work under all the various programs that are there now and get out of \u2013 but it\u2019s always subject to making sure we do it right, and then we are not going to bring the headcount down until we got the job done well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Right. Yeah. As I said, I get it, it\u2019s been a challenging environment. So that\u2019s probably been real difficult. Last, not to beat the dead horse here, but the putback claims, just on the GSC side, because I get it the private label right, that\u2019s going to be solved by the courts and probably pretty difficult, but at least with GSCs is a lot more history. And when you look at some of the Fannie and Freddie filings, BOA, Countrywide really standout on the pending and disputed claims that you are about 6.5 times your closest peer even though the repurchase levels are about in line and withdrawn claims are only about 1.8 times your closest peer. so it seems as though these disputes are BOA specific issue. what gives you confidence that you\u2019re going to be able to buck the trend of the entire industry and can you help us out on that front?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">I think all we can really say at this point quite frankly is that the way that we look at this in the reserving is based on our view of what our understanding agreements are. We\u2019ve said that there are disagreements that are out there. And I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s a lot more saving in that, I think the only other thing that I would say those is that as you look out at and you look at these agreements and you go back, we were able on a look-back basis to get a deal done with Freddie Mac on a global basis to resolve all the Countrywide claims prior to the end of 2008. So I think that the way that we\u2019re going about and looking to solve these challenges, this has not changed a bit.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">I think you also have to remember that if you go and look at 32 and things grew the categories where there\u2019s resolution on. and so that clients are really coming through, there\u2019s obviously disputes are in the sense that the private labels, the FTE issues have been resolved back in New York for over a year now, and we\u2019re waiting for the core process to take place as Bruce mentioned in the Countrywide. So I think the issues have \u2013 the volumes we would have are not coming through a big parts of the production at the time of 2004, 2008 production, because they are settled and monolines with same thing. So obviously the people that I think specifically Fannie that we are going to have biggest target of whether the people still see so many clients.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Right, okay. and then the last one, just on the wealth management, can you give us a sense for net new assets and what they were and what they have been over the last few years, because it seems as though that that\u2019s not a disclosed number anymore? It\u2019d be really helpful to get that figure?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Okay, which number you\u2019re looking for?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">The net new assets in the brokerage business, not necessarily asset management, but to wealth management?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">We\u2019ll really get back to you on that. You can see there\u2019s long-term AUM<strong> </strong>flows, which has been driving the business to be more of a, in the financial plans with the customers and clients. The AUM flows where we focus as we move from sort of the transaction based to the more of money-managed basis and you can see those flows went strong, we\u2019ll get through the net new asset side.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Sure, thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Your next from the site of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer &amp; Company. Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Christopher Kotowski \u2013 Oppenheimer &amp; Co.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Yeah, good morning. Syncora\u2019s press release sided that they received $375 million in the settlement. And you said that it was about 20% of the $3.1 billion, which is a bit more than $600 million. So that implies the settlement rate of \u2013 at about $0.60 on the dollar. And I wondered is there anything that would make Syncora better or worse exposure than the rest of the monoline claims? And then secondly, why would the settlement rate on the private-label be radically lower than what it is on the monolines?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Yeah, I think you have to be careful Chris, I can assure you that the rate if which was paid was not anywhere near the number that you quoted, and the reason is keep in mind with the monolines. As we\u2019ve talked about, you\u2019ve got a couple different buckets that go into what you think a monoline exposure is that drive that number significantly lower than what you just quoted. The first is, there are claims that come in that monolines have submitted. At points in time, monolines have stopped submitting claims, because they believe that they\u2019re going the route of litigation. And then third, over above those two buckets you have things that may happen in the future that have not been realized or worked through. So when I quoted the fact that, the Syncora settlement was 20% of those claims, you should not in any way extrapolate out that, that\u2019s the payment percentage.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Christopher Kotowski \u2013 Oppenheimer &amp; Co.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">I try to understand that, but I'll follow up. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">And we'll take our final questions from the site of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Hi, just a real big picture question. What inning are we in from the negative impact from this very low interest rate environment? You had one bank, say it was pretty much done; you're not going to have a whole lot more negative impact. You had another large bank saying, well it\u2019s more than half done, it's mostly done. And a third bank has said, well actually it's going to hurt a lot more for you to stay here. So where do you stand on that question? And specifically, I know that this quarter the deposit rates only declined by two basis points whereas the yield on loans were down 11 and commercial loan yields were down 17?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">I\u2019d say a couple of things on that, Mike. The first thing I'll address is just your last question, which is that where do you \u2013 we continue to look at, and given this rate environment to be very disciplined is what \u2013 with respect to what we do on the deposit pricing, if rates persists we\u2019ll continue to revisit that; realizing that when you get to the levels that we're at with perspective deposit pricing, there\u2019s only so much further that you can go. I think with respect to the rest of your question, I think you need to split the rate question really into two pieces. The first piece is that, as you look at loan spreads in what we\u2019re seeing from a loan spread perspective, on those things that are floating rate base, the spreads at this point in some of the new origination spread that we\u2019ve seen, that the spreads on those have stabilized.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">So I think as it relates to \u2013 is there more downside or you\u2019re concerned more on rates with respect to that. At this point, I think we feel okay with that. The last piece is, where it is with respect to those fixed rate instruments. We\u2019ve been very careful at this point to manage, and to manage the duration such that we don\u2019t have OCI issues with respect to Basel 3.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">And if you look at on a swapped basis with respect to duration on the securities portfolio, we\u2019re just over a year on a swapped basis realizing it\u2019s a couple more years if you didn\u2019t take into account swap.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">So I think, as we look at it, the piece that probably has some element of risk over time is that these rates stay at this point, the overall securities portfolio, but I think a lot of what we do at this point, the low rate environment is baked into it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Just one follow-up, as I\u2019m looking at page 10 of the supplement, and I\u2019m sure you know these numbers, total commercial yield from the first quarter to the second quarter went from 3.52% to 3.35% that\u2019s a 17 basis point decline in the commercial loan yield, so is there noise there, what gives you such good confidence that, that decline is pretty done?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">I think if you go into it that, if you look at where the majority of the noise came in, and if you look at \u2013 there are two pieces that moves, the first and probably the most significant was when we disclosed this back in the first quarter, we had some gains on the overall leasing portfolio that settled up during the first quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">So if you look at that, if you look at the number, you can see the leasing portfolio came in by about 100 basis points, that\u2019s clearly something as we look out at that we don\u2019t expect to repeat.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">So I think as you look at those two buckets, that\u2019s the reason both \u2013 so if you look at U.S. commercial, it was down a little bit, commercial real estate was effectively flat, commercial lease is where you saw the biggest change, and on the non-U.S. commercial stuff, we will see that number bounce around a little bit as if we\u2019re doing trade financing, it tends to have a little bit lower rate than some of the straight-up corporate stuff. But I would say, as we look out at and look at the new origination spreads that we\u2019re seeing on the base business, we really didn\u2019t see any erosion of spreads that we booked with respect to newer loans.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">For that jumping off point of what, would you say 10.2 billion of NII, you expect that to probably be flat or higher than?</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">What we said at this point is that, we think that\u2019s the jumping off point, we mentioned the benefits that we have from the long-term debt footprint, and then we\u2019ll obviously need to see activities during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">All right, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Mike, to back up to the broader level, think about two or three things, one is the loan rate environment has been impacting us, and that\u2019s why one of the issues about the \u2013 you have to go out to the cost side and get the cost structured in line, because low and straight volume with respect to revenues.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Secondly, remembering these one-off portfolios we are giving up net interest margin gross yield, bit if you look at net interest margin minus charge-offs you\u2019ll see that it\u2019s actually growing year-over-year second quarter last year, second quarter this year. So what is running off is costing us money that is contributing a lot for the pre-tax volumes we said. And the third is, we continue to have benefits that we think that are unique to this franchise because of the amount of acquisition debt we\u2019ve build up in the long term debt size to continue to drive that down, so as you watch the balance sheet shift across time the non-interest bearing sources, deposit funding sources become more and more, higher and higher percentage of which they are already high of the total funding.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">And if you think about it very simply, we pay about a $0.5 billion a quarter for all the deposit funding, $1 trillion and we pay about $2.5 billion round numbers a quarter for the $308 billion of long-term debt. So the effectiveness of moving that down, because just don\u2019t need the size, we have the \u2013 because we are running of late, as we switch [on gear] yielding as much is very beneficial going forward. So we are fighting the trend, this is a trend that\u2019s held so longer than most have expected, but we\u2019re fighting with all the areas and the corporate that we have.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">All right. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">And we do have one more question queuing in the site of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Matthew H. Burnell \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Good morning, just a administrative question, you noted that your tax guidance for the reminder of the year is around 22% excluding the effects of the UK tax. Last quarter you noted that, you thought the tax rate was going to be about 30%, I\u2019m just curious as to what\u2019s driving the decline in the tax rate guidance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">I believe and I\u2019d have to go back and look, I think if you look at it and what we are saying now is that, the 22% includes the different preference items that we have based on where we are today. And as we look out, that 22% is a good number as it relates to what we\u2019d expect before as we\u2019ve said adjusting for what we\u2019d see coming out of UK tax.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Matthew H. Burnell \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">All right. And then again another \u2013 one final administrative question, you mentioned about $300 million in benefits from your actions reducing higher cost debt, $60 million of debt was recognized in the second quarter. Then on page 8 of the slide deck, you say that there's about a $100 million of savings from those actions in 2012, and another $180 million expected in 2013. Is that $300 million number you're talking about the equivalent of the $280 million in combined savings in \u201912 and \u201913?</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">We gave you the information on the liability management action to give you a senses to the benefit that they would provide. So the way to think about those savings that we've talked about in the liability management, is they\u2019re embedded in the $300 million quarterly benefit of which $240 million will be incremental in the third quarter of this year relative to the second quarter of this year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Matthew H. Burnell \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">Okay, that's helpful. Thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">We have no further questions at this time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">Thank you everybody. We look forward talking to you next quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">And this concludes today's program. Have a great day.

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. (Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll take questions in turn during our Q&amp;A session. And please note, today\u2019s call is being recorded.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">It's now my pleasure to turn the program over to Kevin Stitt. Please begin sir.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Kevin Stitt</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning. Before Brian and Bruce begin their comments, let me remind you that this presentation does contain some forward-looking statements regarding both our financial condition and financial results, and that these statements involve certain risks that may cause actual results in the future to be different from our current expectations. For additional factors, please see our press release and SEC documents.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">And with that, let me turn it over to Bruce.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thanks Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I am going to start the presentation on slide four. And as I am sure you\u2019ve all seen for the third quarter of 2012 we reported net revenue of $20.6 billion. Importantly, that number was reduced by about $1.9 billion for FVO and DVA and if we adjust for that you get to a revenue net of interest expense of $22.5 billion for the quarter. Net income was $340 million or $0.00 a share after preferred dividends.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">The results reflect the previously announced charges in late September that relate to $1.9 billion for the combination of FVO adjustments as well as DVA resulting from the significant tightening that we saw in our credit spreads during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">In addition, we had $1.6 billion of pre-tax of total litigation expense including the charge for the Merrill Lynch Class Action Settlement. Lastly, we had about $800 million of tax expense related to the reduction in the UK tax rate. In the aggregate, these items negatively impacted EPS by approximately $0.28.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We turn to slide five, the results in the third quarter demonstrated ongoing momentum on several fronts. Period-end deposits across the company grew $28 billion, or 2.7% versus the second quarter which is an 11% annualized rate, and we accomplished that as the rates on the deposits declined slightly from 20 basis points to 18 basis points. The net interest yield increased by 11 basis points as our liability management actions continue to benefit net interest income.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Our Mortgage business home loans had its most profitable quarter excluding asset sales since we started reporting its results separately with first-lien production up by 13%. Wealth and Investment Management showed growth in long-term assets under management, deposits and record loan levels while maintaining solid margins.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Ending loans in our Global Banking segment increased 2.5% from the second quarter or 10% on an annualized basis. Results in the capital markets area reflected strong performances both on a quarter-over-quarter as well as a year ago basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We continue to invest in growth areas of our company such as mortgage lending, small business banking and financial advisors. Our 60 plus day delinquent loans serviced out in a Legacy Servicing business declined 12% from second quarter levels, and we\u2019ll spend sometime later in the presentation talking about what that means going forward. And our number of full time equivalent employees declined approximately 3,000 from the end of the second quarter related to a different New BAC initiatives.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">If you turn to slide six, a lot of information on the balance sheet highlight area, I just want to draw your attention to three of the line items. The first, our tangible common equity ratio improved by 12 basis points to 6.95%. If you move down the tangible book-value, it grew by $0.26 in the quarter, up to $13.48 and if you look at our adjusted loan coverage where we look at the allowance for loans over annualized charge-offs, it improved during the quarter to 2.2 times.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">If you turn to slide seven; as we\u2019ve seen all year, regulatory capital continued to strengthen. Our Basel 1 Tier 1 common capital ratio was up 17 basis points to 11.41%. Remember, FVO in the tax charge do not impact regulatory capital.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">As we near the 2013 implementation period for Basel 3, we\u2019ve estimated our Tier 1 common equity ratio and it's components to provide a better understanding of where we are relative to the expected 2019 Basel 3 requirements. Our estimate as per the final U.S. market risk rules in the U.S. Basel 3 NPRs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">As of the end of the third quarter, on a fully phased-in basis, we estimate that that Basel 3 Tier 1 capital ratio would have been 8.97%. Recall last quarter, we estimated Basel 3 under BIS Basel 3 guidelines to be approximately 8.1% and 7.95% applying the U.S. Basel 3 NPRs. If we look at the components of the ratio, our Tier 1 common equity was $134.6 billion, while our risk weighted assets would have been $1.501 trillion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">A couple points I would like to make before we leave this slide. If we look at the improvement in the numerator of roughly $8 billion, we did benefit during the quarter given the reduction that we saw in the rate environment where our OCI, which flows through the balance sheet, not the income statement, was up about $3.2 billion and contributed 21 basis points to that ratio. We also benefited on the denominator, in portion of the increase due to the tightening credit spreads that we saw across the market that did benefit the denominator.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We turn to the slide eight, and look at liquidity. Global Excess Liquidity sources increased modestly from $378 billion to $380 billion during the quarter. That was accomplished while we reduced the long-term debt footprint across the entire enterprise by about $15 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">A couple of actions of note during the third quarter; we had $6.2 billion of liability management actions which consisted primarily of parent redemptions of trust preferred securities as well as sub debt and in addition to that we had $12 billion of maturities that were repaid at the parent.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We took an additional action during the first quarter of October of calling $5.1 billion of additional trust preferred securities that will benefit NII by about $50 million in the fourth quarter of this year and on a go forward basis about $300 million. And as we noted before, there will be a loss upon the redemption that we\u2019ll take in the fourth quarter of about $100 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">If we focus on the parent company for just a moment, parent company remained very strong at $102 billion. And if you look at the reduction and liquidity combined or compared to the reduction in the debt footprint, liquidity at the parent declined by $9 billion when the overall debt footprint at the parent shrink by $18 billion as we continue to move money from our bank subsidiaries up to the parent.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Time to required funding at the end of the quarter was at 35 months and as we move forward and continue to shrink the debt footprint and smooth out the maturity profile, we would expect over the next six to eight quarters that you will see that time required funding migrate down to a targeted range in the 21 to 24 month timeframe.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">On slide nine, if we look at net interest income. Net interest income on a reported basis increased from $9.8 billion or a yield of 2.21% in the second quarter to $10.2 billion or 2.32% during the third quarter. If we adjust those numbers for market related hedge ineffectiveness as well as market related premium amortization or FAS 91, our net interest income increased from $10.3 billion or 2.32% up to $10.5 billion or 2.39% during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">If we look at the activity within the quarter, we benefited during the quarter from the reduction of long-term debt driven by both our liability management actions as well as debt repayment. In addition, our trading related net interest income improved during the quarter. Partially offsetting these improvements were lower consumer loan balances and yields as well as lower investment security yields.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Near-term, if we look at where we are at the end of the third quarter and given existing rate levels, we estimate that quarterly net interest income will start at the base of approximately $10.5 billion. The impact of our liability management actions in our long-term debt maturities are expected to offset any headwinds that we see from continued pressure on both consumer loan balances, as well as investment security portfolio repricing. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In general, as you consider the rate environment, if rates increased from the end of September, we would look to see benefits in our net interest income. And on the other side to the extent that the rates declined, you could see reductions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On slide 10, we get in to the businesses. In consumer and business banking, earnings were $1.3 billion during the quarter, an increase of $130 million in the second quarter driven by lower non-interest expense in provision, which were partially offset by lower revenue.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Non-interest income decreased from the second quarter due mainly to the impact of our consumer protection products. Credit quality improved again, as net charge-offs dropped to $170 million. Average deposits increased almost $4 billion or 1% from the second quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On slide 11, we give you some key indicators for our consumer and business banking area for the quarter. Compared to the second quarter, debit card purchased volumes declined seasonally, while credit card purchase volumes adjusted for our portfolio of divestitures were relatively flat. Retail credit spend per active account was up 6% from the third quarter of 2011.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">If we look at the US credit card loss rate, it\u2019s the lowest that we\u2019ve seen since the third quarter of 2006, while the 30 plus day delinquency rate is at a historic low. Banking centers declined as we continue to optimize the delivery network around customer behaviors.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We did continue to increase our mobile banking customer base to more than 11 million people, which is an 8% increase from the prior and up 30% from the year ago quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We turn to slide 12, consumer real estate services reported a loss of $877 million during the quarter, versus a loss of $766 million in the second quarter of this year. Higher revenue, which included MSR gains, net of hedge results, the sale of a business and [mobile] rep and warrant expense were more than offset by higher expenses as well as a higher provision. The provision for reps and warrants was $307 million in the quarter, a decrease from $395 million that we experienced in the second quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Expenses were up $672 million, LAS drove that expense increase due to higher litigation expense, servicing cost and other mortgage related matters. Provision increased $75 million during the quarter, driven by the impact of new regulatory guidance on loans discharged at bankruptcy which I\u2019ll discuss when I get to credit quality later in this presentation, and it was partially offset by a recovery in the home equity PCI portfolio due to an improvement in the home price outlook.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">The Home Loans business, which is responsible for first-lien and home equity originations within this segment, recorded a profit of $264 million for the quarter. First mortgage retail originations of $20 billion were up 13% from the prior quarter due to lower rates and up 19% compared with retail originations a year ago. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">As you\u2019ll recall we exited the correspondent business late last year, so current correspondent originations are non-existent versus volumes of approximately $16 billion a year ago, even with the exist from the corresponded channel core production income is higher than the year ago, our MSR asset decreased by $621 during the quarter driven primarily by lower mortgage rates and ended the quarter at $5.1 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">MSR hedge results more than offset market valuation declines. And if we look at the Cap rate on the MSR at the end of the period, it was at 45 basis points versus 47 basis points in the second quarter and 52 basis points a year ago.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On slide 13, we showed some comparisons of certain matrix in our legacy asset and servicing area on a linked-quarter basis as well as compared to a year ago, as we continue to work very hard to reduce delinquent loans and find solutions for home owners. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As you\u2019ll recall, the legacy assets and servicing area reflects all of our servicing operations and the results of our MSR activities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Our domestic FTEs excluding contractors decreased for the first time in this area in 14 quarters. The number of first-lien serviced drop 6% in the quarter, but more importantly the number of 60 plus day delinquent loans dropped by 12%. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">The drop in 60 day plus delinquencies will have a positive impact on our staffing levels in the fourth quarter and beyond, as servicing cost going forward should benefit given that we were fully staffed in the third quarter to handle the various new programs and regulations.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">And we\u2019ve discussed previously, we\u2019ll continue hard both working through these delinquent loans internally as well as looking externally for solutions to reduce this number of delinquent loans.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On slide 14, you can see that our outstanding rep and warrant claims increased by 12% from the end of June, versus the 41% increase we experienced during the second quarter of this year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Outstanding claims from the GSEs did increase albeit at a slower rate, as a result of ongoing disagreements with Fannie Mae about what constitutes a valid repurchase request.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Since June, given the settlement we discussed last quarter with Syncora, the backlog with Monolines has decreased. On the private label side, we had $1.9 billion increase in outstanding claims to a total of $10.5 billion at the end of the quarter. The increased on the private label side is primarily due to claims received from trustees and securitization sponsors. But keep in mind that this increase in aggregate non-GSE claims was taken in to consideration when we developed the increase in our reserves at the time of Bank of New York settlement during the second quarter of last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We would expect these claims to continue to grow as the process for ultimate resolution continues to evolve and remain somewhat unclear.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">The other thing we ask you to keep in mind is this table reflects the unpaid principal amount of the loans, not the actual amount of losses that are incurred on the loans. Our reserve for reps and warrants at the end of the quarter increased slightly to $16.3 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In the second quarter, we provided a range of possible loss over and above existing reserve levels of up to $5 billion, which only apply to non-GSE loans. At the time, a range was not provided for GSE activity as we were unable to estimate such a range.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In the third quarter as a result of ongoing dialogue and discussion with the GSEs, we have obtained additional information from which we are now able to determine a reasonable estimate of a range of possible loss in excess of our recorded reps and warrants liabilities for the GSEs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We currently estimate that the range of possible loss for both the GSEs and the non-GSEs for rep and warrant exposures could be up to $6 billion, over our accruals of September 30th and compared to the up to $5 billion over accruals at June 30 which once again were only for non-GSE reps and warrant exposures. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">The increase in the range of possible loss from our June 30 period is the net impact of among other changes updated assumptions and the inclusion of GSE rep and warrant exposure, as well as other developments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We move to our global wealth and investment management area, on slide 15. Earnings for the quarter of $542 million or a pre-tax margin of approximately 20% were inline with the results that we saw in the second quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Period end deposit growth of $6.4 billion and period end loan growth of $2.1 billion help to offset the impact of the continued low rate environment. Ending loan balances, as I mentioned earlier, were at record levels. And solid long-term AUM flows of $5.7 billion help to offset seasonal declines. This client activity along with the strong overall market performance in the third quarter should benefit our fourth quarter results.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">If we move to global banking on slide 16, we had net income in the third quarter of $1.3 billion, which reflected higher net interest income and a reduction in expenses that was offset by gains in the second quarter related the certain legacy assets dispositions which did not recur in the third quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Period and loans and leases increased $6.7 billion or 2.5% from the second quarter, with growth across C&amp;I, commercial real estate, leasing as well as some quarter end findings. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Average deposit balances were up 5% from the second quarter to $252 billion as our corporate customers remain very liquid. Asset quality continued to be very strong and continued the trend from prior quarters, net charge-offs were down, NPL, NPAs dropped 20% to $2.6 billion and our reservable utilized criticized exposure declined 17%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On slide 17, investment banking fees, investment banking fees at $1.336 billion were up nicely over both the prior quarter, up 17% as well as up 42% from the year ago period. We look at where we were relative to our competitors; we maintained a strong number two global ranking in fees to date. And as you can see below, we continue to have leading market shares globally in many of these businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We switch to Global Markets on slide 18. Earnings were impacted by a DVA loss of approximately $580 million and the tax charge for changes in the UK corporate tax rate. If we back out the DVA and the charge for taxes, net income actually increased 41% from the second quarter to $789 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Revenue ex-DVA for the entire segment was up 5% and once again DVA losses in the quarter of $580 million last quarter losses were $156 million and those compared to gains in the year ago period to approximately $1.7 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Sales and trading revenue ex-DVA was down 3% from the second quarter, but improved substantially from year ago levels. Within FICC, the core businesses of credit, mortgages and rates and currencies performed very well. Our FICC revenue ex-DVA was essentially flat with the second quarter at $2.5 billion delivering a solid performance. In equities, excluding DVA results decreased 8% from the second quarter as lower volatility and a continued lack of investor appetite for equity products depressed volumes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On the expense side, expenses declined from both the second quarter in the prior year driven by lower personnel related expense as well as lower operational costs. Average VAR for the quarter was $55 million, down 12% from the second quarter and 67% from the prior year. And as we look at that, we continue to generate increasing levels of revenue for each dollar of risk that we take within this segment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On slide 19, we show you the results of all other which includes our Global Principal Investments business, the non-U.S. consumer card business, our discretionary portfolio associated with interest rate risk management, insurance as well as the discontinued real estate portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">The revenue decrease from the second quarter of this year was due to a negative valuation of adjustment of $1.3 billion on structured liabilities under FVO and lowered gains on debt and trust preferred repurchases partially offset by higher equity investment income during the quarter. The increase in non-interest expense was due to higher litigation expense and if we were to exclude that, non-interest expense declined compared to the second quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On slide 20, non-interest expense, I would like to make a couple of comments here. Non-interest expense of $17.5 billion was down slightly from the third quarter of last year and up relative to the second quarter of this year. If we were to back out the increase in litigation expense that we incurred during the quarter, non-interest expense actually declined from Q2 to Q3.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">If we look at the components of that, we saw improvements in personnel costs and other cost savings realized from our New BAC initiatives and that was partially offset by higher cost of mortgage servicing and other mortgage related matters, which as I mentioned previously, we would expect to see come down in the fourth quarter relative to the third. We also invested in selective growth areas during the quarter in our mortgage loan officers, our small business bankers and our financial solution advisors.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">If we move down, and you look at the number of full-time equivalent employees, we started to implement Phase I of New BAC in the fourth quarter of 2011. Outside of LAS, which is the grey bar, you can see since we began the implementation, we have reduced the FTEs across the company outside of Legacy Assets and Servicing by almost 21,000 people or over 8% since we began that implementation. And as you can see, Legacy Assets and Servicing FTEs increased, but have now stabilized and as I said we would expect the sub start seeing come down in the fourth quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">If we turn to slide 21, although provision was relatively flat with the second quarter, there were two events that impacted both the net charge-offs and non-performing loans that you\u2019ve heard others to speak about. The first, regulators did provide new guidance to the industry in the third quarter of this year that stated loans discharged from the courts as part of the Chapter 7 Bankruptcy should be written down the collateral value and classified as non-performing irrespective of the borrowers\u2019 payment status.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">As a result, we charged-off $478 million in loans and reduced reserves by $139 million resulting in a provision increase of $339 million in the quarter as a result of this new guidance. Non-performing loans increased by $1.1 billion as a result of this change and $954 million or 91% of these borrowers are current on their contractual payments. Of these contractually performing loans more than 70% were discharged from bankruptcy more than 12 months ago and nearly 40% were discharged 24 months or more ago.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">The other change, recall in March, we and other large mortgage servicers agreed in the settlement with the DOJ and 49 state attorneys to provide programs to assist home owners in modifying loans and other borrower assistant programs. We referred to that as the national mortgage settlement. As a result of these agreements, we incurred charge-offs in the third quarter of $435 million related to the extinguishment of non-purchased credit impaired loans in this home equity portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">This $435 million had a corresponding decrease in non-performing loans that we reported at the end of third quarter. These loans were under water and in the later stages of delinquency or were loans that were current on their junior-lien, but severely delinquent on their underlying first.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Associated with this settlement, we also extinguished $1.7 billion of home equity loans in the PCI portfolio, resulting in a decline in both the portfolio as well as the corresponding reserve. These items had no provision impact as reserves for these loans were already established.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">If we turn to slide 22, we\u2019ve laid out here, the third quarter of last year, second quarter of this year and third quarter and then adjusted the numbers on the far right column for this change in regulatory guidance and the National Mortgage Settlement and what you see here are three points that we would like to make. First is net charge-offs after making these adjustments declined $417 million or 11.5% as our underlying asset quality trends continue to strengthen.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Second, 30 plus day performing consumer delinquencies, excluding fully insured consumer real estate loans declined about $200 million or 2% and our non-performers decreased $1.4 billion or 5.7% versus the second quarter, driven equally by improvements in both commercial as well as consumer loan quality. And on the commercial side, our utilized reservable criticized exposure improved by 15% or about $3 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">As we look at credit quality for the balance of the year, we would expect the provision as we discussed at the end of last quarter to be in the range of $1.8 billion which is what we\u2019ve seen over the last two quarters and $2.4 billion which we saw during the first quarter, so that guidance is unchanged from what we have given before.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And with that, let me turn it over to Brian.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Thank you, Bruce. I am going to cover slide 23 and add a few thoughts before we take your questions. If you think back to when we started the year, we said that we focus no a few key areas. Building the capital of the company, continue to mange risk, continue reducing the cost base of the company and driving our core business growth for the franchise.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">As you look at the results Bruce covered, I think we have shown strong results and we\u2019re moving in the right direction in every area. Our industry leading Tier 1 common capital levels provided solid base to serve our customers and balance sheet that can do great customer business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">But, what I wanted to draw your attention to on this slide is the progress we made across our three groups of customers and clients, whether it\u2019s our consumers or companies or institutional investors. If you look at the business lines that Bruce described, our operational metrics are improving across the board and the cost of each of the operating businesses other than LAS were down linked quarter and year-over-year while revenues continue to be solid.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">For the individual consumers we serve, our deposits continue to grow; our net account growth was solid this quarter and we regained the market share in the direct to consumer mortgage lending business. With our preferred clients in our consumer business, our growth continues as we continue to improve the offers we have for those clients with increased checking accounts and brokerage assets in our Merrill Lynch platforms.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">If you think about our service network overall, we continue to optimize it, reducing branches as we meet the customer behavior changes as they move to online and mobile banking which continues to increase nicely with 11 million users in the mobile and tablet platform.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">The companies we serve are also doing more business with us; small business originations are up, as Bruce stated earlier. Loans continue to expand and investment banking fees continue to grow. As we move to our institutional investor clients, we continue to add to our industry leading research capabilities and our sales and trading revenue continue to do well in an overall different environment and the markets that we had during the summer months.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So this quarter shows the progress that the company continues to make. It shows the hard work of all our teammates of streamlining and simplifying the company is paying off. It shows the strength of the integrated business model which serves customers and clients in a way that no other firm can. And it shows how that combination deepens relationships, provides the best-in-class financial capabilities and will drive growth.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">With that, Bruce and I would be happy to take your questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p7\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">(Operator Instructions) And we\u2019ll go first to the site of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Just some extraordinary, I would say performance on the capital ratio; wanted to kind of talk about that a little bit, did I hear correctly that that 8.97 is inclusive of the terms of the NPR?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">That's correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So as you think about that, I heard that some notes that there were some kind of benefits that could be somewhat temporary, but obviously over the next several quarters, one would expect that to continue to improve. Can you talk a little bit about, whether you are looking for improvement either in RWAs or your deductions, and then also how you think about that since you are likely to be more or less or either now or certainly in three months at the levels that you\u2019d be required by the combination of Basel 3 capital requirement and (inaudible). </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">When we look at the ratio, lets talk first about the numerator than we can go to the denominator. As I said, there was about $3 billion on the numerator of the $8 billion that related to things that we benefited from rates. We will obviously see how that goes going forward, but I just want to make sure that there was 3 billion there. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">On the numerator side, because of where we are with respect to having NOLs as we go forward, where we are going to be different than most of our peers is on the numerator side. Our pretax income is going to tend to approximate the net income as it relates to capital build. So we\u2019ve got benefits going forward relative to our peers based on using those NOLs which as you all are aware are excluded from a Basel perspective. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">On the denominator side, there are three things that we would also continue to benefit from, as we look to drive this number higher. The first is on the retail credit side. We noted here during the quarter that we had about $27 billion of benefit in risk weighted assets through both the reduction in consumer exposures as well as improvement within the credit portfolio that we saw on the consumer side. And as we continue to reduce non-performing mortgages, as well as one of the consumer credit portfolios in the card business, we\u2019d look to continue to have benefit there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">The second thing is that the structured credit in some of the legacy books will continue to run off between now and 2017, we\u2019ll benefit from that. And then, third, there obviously continues to be a lot of work that\u2019s done with respect to models in developing the systems to make sure that your measurements are appropriate here. So, we feel very good about the capital build during the quarter, and we think as we go forward that the ability to continue to optimize and drive that Basel 3 number continue to have real opportunity for us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Just a follow-up on that, that\u2019s great on the tactical side, what about strategically, now that, you are pretty much where you need to be, how do you think about that capital level differently, and do you think about it in terms of your approach towards allocating to businesses or distributions, how should we think about that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I wouldn\u2019t, and one other things that we highlighted, I\u2019m going to speak first on Basel 1 to that question that, over the course of the last couple of quarters, as we\u2019ve look to optimize our Basel 1 ratio, we were obviously very tight and have fairly firm limits on loan growth as we look to optimize the balance sheet, as we\u2019ve gotten the balance sheet to where we wanted to be, that clearly pursuing loan growth in this rate environment is very much a priority. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And if you look at what we did during this quarter, it\u2019s the culmination of several quarters of work where we started to see good loan growth within the GWIM business. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">We saw the increase in mortgage production, not all of which is loan growth, but some of it is loan growth, and then on the banking and market side where loan growth was extraordinarily strong. So we are using the strength in the balance sheet to look to drive growth in the loan side.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">We are obviously doing it in a prudent way with borrowers that have the credit quality that we should be extending to, and you have seen the results of some of that. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">On Basel 3, as we worked through Basel 3, a little bit of shift in mindset and that you are looking to optimize and consider both how things get measured as well as under Basel 3 as Basel 1, Basel 3 going forward is going to be the governor on capital distributions, so we are obviously very mindful to be managing the balance sheet with Basel 3 front of mind.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">We are obviously at point at the end of the quarter upwards of 9% where we are very close to or in access of the stated minimums we\u2019ll need to work and see where the [safety] buffer comes out. To think we positioned ourselves very well for both growing the business as well as we look forward going through to [seek our] process.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">That should mean that if this process is ongoing that you would expect to see loan growth accelerate honestly from here?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I am not going to suggest on an annualized basis that we saw commercial and corporate loan growth of 10% that you are going to see accelerate. It can bump around a little bit in any quarter, but you should expect and know that internally with those areas that have returns we are pushing and looking to drive loan growth, that's correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I would add that the impact of the portfolios that we identified going back a couple a years to runoff which helps in the capital because as Bruce said earlier they actually capital is less now then it was then because A, they are smaller and the quarterly runoff is more muted which then allows a loan growth to come through the bottom line. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So think about the card business for example, we're getting in a place where we\u2019ve got pretty well positioned where we want and I think with Bruce still here and 75,000 new card customers this quarter, a little bit more than we did last quarter and we're driving very high credit quality. Exactly what we want and we're driving that out. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So as you think about the ability to show loan growth through the sort of all the ins and outs of the runoff portfolios, that\u2019s where we're just starting to see to as those things are getting smaller through the [hole].</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">We\u2019ll take our next question from the side of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yes. Bruce on the net interest income, you said that the 10.5 billion is a good starting point for the fourth quarter NII?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">That\u2019s correct John.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And what are the puts and takes from there? Did you say that you hope to get some debt reductions or the benefits of debt reductions could offset the headwinds that you expect from low rates and runoffs? Did I hear that right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Sure. During the third quarter, we had 6.2 billion, as I mentioned a trough that occurred during the quarter and $12 billion of stated maturities. We\u2019ll have the full benefit of those during the fourth quarter as oppose to just a partial benefit. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">The second thing is the reduction of the troughs, we\u2019ll have the $50 million benefit that I mentioned in the fourth quarter and we're continuing to push deposit pricing down. So that\u2019s a benefit as well. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So as we look at the fourth quarter absent any unexpected decline in rates in any impact of negative hedging effectiveness or FAS 91. We would expect net interest income to be at least in the fourth quarter what was in the third quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">What about the next year NII, Bruce, do you have additional tools on the cost funding side? Do you hope to keep that $10.5 billion run rate or grow or see some pressure from that? Can you give some perspective for next year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We\u2019re managing the portfolio to look to be able to continue to have modest increases in NII through what we\u2019re doing on the debt footprint as well as deposit pricing. So, the goal is to continue to push that up. We think we\u2019ve got a good plan in place to continue to do that. We obviously can\u2019t predict interest rates, but if they were just to stay where they are in the forward curve or to materialize, we think we\u2019ll be successful in doing that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. And then switching over to expenses, do you have any sense of where you might be on the litigation reserve bill cycle, later innings or anyway to frame that for us?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">The Merrily Lynch class action settlement was a significant litigation item to get behind us. And as you look at litigation going forward, we\u2019ve narrowed that with this settlement in large part that there are cases are obviously outside of mortgage, but largely the majority of the litigation that we have now with the Merrill Lynch settlement is within the mortgage area. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And we obviously provide reserves for what we think we have and in the disclosure we give guidance on range of possible loss for what we would expect within the litigation area and we continue to work through those. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">With where we\u2019ve build the balance sheet, obviously getting these behind us is something that we would like to do but we\u2019re only going to do it in a way that makes sense for the shareholder.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. And then, on the LAS side, you mentioned that with the 60 plus delinquents moving down, you should start to see the LAS expenses come down next quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">From an operating basis John, we saw the first decline in FTE, you can see the contract is a little higher. The third quarter was a lot of work because it was a combination of Department of Justice, the timely mind work and also just the general work. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">But as we look at it in even sense at the quarter end we\u2019ve seen the headcounts start to come down already even further. So this thing has been - have done a lot of work on operating basis, we\u2019d say the numbers of people and stuff like that it will be down in the fourth quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">The question is from the litigation perspective, you know those are things bouncing around a little bit if you look across all the last quarter. But from an operating basis, we\u2019ve already reduced the headcount in the fourth quarter from what it was in the third quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So I guess from a total expenses all end jumping off point for the fourth quarter, if we adjust for our own estimate a litigation reserves first [tell] what you think would be a number for the expenses to jump off from?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I think if you just for the litigation expenses, those are going to be a good place to jump off from, and as Brian referenced we think there is the opportunity within the LAS areas to start driving those expenses down in the fourth quarter and clearly into 13.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">John, the way we think about it as we look at it year-over-year, third quarter last year, third quarter this year we had sort of flat expenses, but if you look at the impact of the increase and litigation increase in LAS, the rest the company is down $1 billion or so in operating expenses. And that will move up or down because, with a better training quarter, we could have some more compensation there but you are seeing the impacts of new BAC plus the other [nations] and the company taking the expenses down and we are just continue to work at. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">That being said, we are still making investments in those company to make sure that we are doing the right thing to have a franchise and want coming of out. So more loan officers, FSAs, preferred bankers and $3 billion plus in systems development work this year, (inaudible) million of which is going to help us get the expense stay down in future years. So we\u2019re trying to balance that and that you would see expenses from the core basis what I am pointing out continuing to trend down and we're feeling better about that and the best in this quarter is we think, as you look at the LAS, you see the breakpoint here and we will see how to keep driving that down in the fourth quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. And the last thing from me is on the mortgage banking fee results. First, can you drill down a little bit of the drivers of the strong mortgage banking fees; you mentioned the origination volume. Just what you saw gain on sale margins and then also how did the MSR hedge gains contributed and was there a business sale as well that you mentioned?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Sure. Within mortgage banking we did see a business sale that was about $175 million of a small ancillary business that materialized in the quarter. The second thing is, with respect to mortgage margins, they stayed relative firm in the third quarter relative to the second quarter given that the activities that the industry had industry-wide. And the third point of your question is, if you go and look at page 26 of our supplement, when you mention the MSR hedge, that relative to the last couple of quarters, we were about $350 million better in the third quarter than we had been the prior several quarters and we detailed that on slide 26.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">John, one thing I would say, tying those two questions together, on the origination side, you can see the volumes coming up, but we\u2019ve added 3,000 more people during this year than we thought we have in the underwriting fulfillment side of the good mortgage side to help us get the volumes going and those people continue to come on stream. So our capacity to grow there is expanding and some of the people that were into all that account, you can see, but some of the people we were taking out LAS were converting to the first mortgage business because it needs experience to mortgage to help build our capacity, like a lot of our colleagues, the volume levels have been high and our capacity get them close with the underlying standards; it\u2019s been a lot of work and so we\u2019ve added 3,000 or 4,000 people I think at this point, but then when we thought we would be this year and we\u2019ll continue to do that to capture the revenue.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">We\u2019ll move next to the site of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer &amp; Company. Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer &amp; Company</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yeah. Good morning. I am looking at slide 39 and slide seven on the capital and I am sorry maybe I am a little, but the slide there and I am trying to reconcile and then slide 39 is very helpful and it\u2019s obviously nice and that the numerator is going up and the denominator is going down. But, if we\u2019re looking at slide 39 I guess, which, I am confused about, which of these movements are due to say changes in markets and rates and spreads and so on; how much of the movement is actually due to changes in the underlying assets and then, how much of the movement is due to the changes in models and assumptions, if you look at the main categories on slide 39?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. This bridge between June 30th and September 30th will be very close, recall that when we reported at June, we were using BIS as opposed to at September 30th that we\u2019re now using the U.S. NPR that had some about 15 basis points difference. But with that being said, if you look at the 126.8 to the 134.6 it\u2019s roughly $8 billion and of that $8 billion, roughly $3.2 billion was due to the impact that rates had on our securities portfolio as well as our MSR. That's the piece that was impacted by rates and there was nothing that we directly did to impact that. The rest of what you saw during the quarter had to do with pre-tax earnings before FVO which does not affect regulatory capital, it had to do with some different assets if the bank that are no longer excluded from the calculation and it had to do with a variety of other things including the fact that we no longer have any 10% threshold deductions in the number. That's the bridge on the numerator.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer &amp; Company</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">If you move to the denominator and you look at the page 39, it\u2019s about $65 billion reduction in risk weighted assets, let me give you the three biggest buckets of that. As I mentioned earlier, the first bucket is about $27 billion as it relates to retail or consumer exposures. The lion share of that $27 billion have to do with either reductions in the actual exposure or the core credit improvement that we saw within the book and a very small amount of that had to do with any model changes or model optimization.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">The second big bucket that\u2019s out there is in the OTC derivatives in repo which was about $26 billion. If you look at those numbers almost all of that $26 billion had to do with either reductions in exposure, improvements with how we manage collateral or improvements in the underlying quality of the counterparty.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">The third bucket and the smallest bucket of which about, is about $18 billion is a variety of things included within that $18 billion bucket, spread tightening that we saw out in the market that resulted in the ratio coming down; you can see though that the $18 billion is relatively small compared to the overall $65 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer &amp; Company</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Thank you for that. That\u2019s the best explanation any bankers have ever offered and I think it\u2019s a model for the rest of the industry and I appreciate that. The other thing I was just wondering on slide 21, you were the only bank that flagged the impact of the mortgage settlement. Everybody talked about the OCC guidance. But is this roughly $400 million, is this going to be a quarterly thing for a while that we're going to, you know, obviously you\u2019ve made provisions for these, the impact of the NMS, but should we expect to see charge-offs at an elevated level for a year or two?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">No, as we work through the National Mortgage Settlement, we're working very hard to beat through a significant portion of the obligations that we have for modifications. The third quarter -- and I think we have a pretty good sense for this, without question will be the largest number like this that comes through, probably very small in the fourth quarter and maybe a little bit of carryover in the next year, but this is by far the most significant quarter that you will see with this. As you said, it doesn\u2019t affect the provision because you\u2019ve got both a write-off as well as an allowance, but that should be a lot smaller going forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">We\u2019ll go next to the site of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Good morning. A couple of follow-ups on the legacy mortgage costs and looking out beyond fourth quarter, just trying to get a sense of how quickly they may come down and I guess, how easy you think it may be to forecast, just think about modest loan price appreciation from here and nothing unusual on the regulatory side?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Well, I think, I would say that we expect them to come down, there have been, one of the things that\u2019s been difficult about this is the third party impacts and timing of that and from what we may have thought last year at this time for example, so the Department of Justice settlement took longer to get finalized therefore it took longer to put in, so, those, yeah, so there is outside impacts going to have them.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">But given everything we know, we would expect them to come down next quarter and beyond. We got to be careful because sometimes there are sort of non-operating adjustments in there. So just if you think about the headcount and the work we do, because the 60 plus day delinquencies are down as you see on the slide, that we can forecast in the work and what we\u2019re seeing as we\u2019re modifying a lot of loans and getting through those, the short sale volumes are as high as they\u2019ve ever been and the liquidation volumes are high.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So everything we see says that we just have to be a little careful about how we report our quarter based on ebbs and flows and some of the legislation gets passed the state levels and things like that and they can have an impact.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I would tell you that, what we\u2019re seeing as the inventory clears very quickly, so as we get to the properties, they sell quickly within 60 days to 90 days that\u2019s been true; we\u2019re seeing by geography that areas where the process can move forward and we\u2019re seeing the outstanding 60 plus rate drop more dramatically because in the California, Arizona versus the areas which moved a little slower, New Jersey or Illinois for example. But everything we said, this is this is coming down because the works going away. You point your finger to the one key question which is if changes are made to the policies or programs that can slow it down, but I don't think there is much volume; we are seeing reduction 60 plus, that would overcome that frankly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And maybe I\u2019ll just toss some numbers out there, you are at $12 billion annual run rate right now, I feel like at one point you said $2 billion could be a more sustainable level as you move through all this, so that's a $10 billion decline. Any guess on, does it take two years to get through that, is it five years to get through that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I think we would look at it and say \u201813 and into \u201814 it would be through that base, and I think we noted that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">But again, that\u2019s subject to caveat and something change in rules, something change in the rules, but right now as we said, we would expect that as we move through next year, the year end numbers would still be elevated, but as we move into \u201814, you would see them come down to more normalized levels. We are doing everything we can move to get through this as quick as possible.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. And then just other topic here, you know as we think about maybe some of the interest rates out there outside the treasury, so like mortgage rates, the agency RMBS rates and I think a lot of other asset classes you have seen rates come down in the securities side. How you just conceptually think about managing the discretionary book from here, and I understand you are trying to grow C&amp;I loans a little bit more, but obviously the discretionary book is still a pretty big chunk and you have a lot of deposits that you need to try and balance?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">One of the things that we are not going to do in this rate environment is stretch for yield and create an OCI problem under Basel 3 going forward. So on the securities portfolio, if you aggregate the securities portfolio as well as our whole loan portfolio, it's about a $600 billion total number that we're managing. It has an average life of about 2.5 years. And as I mentioned on the questions for net interest income, even with where we're reinvesting things that are either come due or repaid, we think the shrinkage in the long-term debt footprint will at least cover what we\u2019ve got as far as repricing absent no changes and forward rates going forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">You bring up a good point which the industry is obviously focused on is that the one area and the one area and the one asset class that doesn\u2019t have OCI risk and that\u2019s funded on the asset side the way we fund our liabilities is loan growth, and we\u2019ve been pushing over the last couple of quarters for that loan growth. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">As we talked about, we saw in GWIM as well as in the institutional side, we started to see that loan growth, and it's obviously as it relates to matching in the way that we manage capital where we would like to be. So it's obviously an environment that\u2019s not easy to manage in, but we think we got a variety of levers, most notably a high cost debt that we can continue to take down, so that you see some more type results to what we saw this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">We\u2019ll go next to the site of Ed Najarian with ISI Group. Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Ed Najarian - ISI Group</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Two questions, the first just in terms of the GSE related mortgage repurchase claims. You know, obviously we're seeing other banks sort of move through that process, build reserves to sort of put that claim risk behind them. I know you\u2019re in a dispute with Fannie. Any sense of how you expect that dispute to get resolved, do you think that\u2019s something that you\u2019ll just sort of gradually resolve with the additional reserves and resolutions over time, do you expect to see some kind of a settlement with Fannie. Any sense of when that overhang might get sort of put in to the rearview mirror or how it will be put into the rearview mirror?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">The first point Ed, that we\u2019ve made here and you see it in the numbers is that, with respect to current winnages things that have been under (inaudible) over the last couple of years, where we have an obligation to repurchase those and we have been repurchasing those. What you see when you look at the schedules, are that the increases in the unpaid or the balance of outstanding claims which as I said, are notional not losses, where you\u2019re seeing the build up is in those payments where they\u2019re greater than 24 months. </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So, with respect to the piece that\u2019s greater than 24 months, I would really just repeat what we\u2019ve said previously that there are two ways that this gets resolved, we have different points of view on this, we continue to have ongoing discussions, and I think the most likely outcomes are either that there is a settlement of a sort or there is some other way that we look to resolve that and that core disagreement remains. As we\u2019ve said in the disclosures and how we\u2019ve updated the range of possible loss, there are ongoing discussions, but there is obviously nothing done.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Ed Najarian - ISI Group</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Well, that\u2019s sort of serves of my point; the two sides have this core disagreement. You know I guess you are probably unwilling to speculate how you sort of come to the middle on that core disagreement, but do you feel like its in your best interest now to sort of maybe be more proactive on that, try to meet in the middle, try to get that settle and try to get that for behind you, or do you feel pretty firm in your stance that we are right and we are going to keep digging out in our heels on this issue?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Given the disclosure we\u2019ve put out, we obviously feel pretty strongly about what our position is here. At the same time, and as we seen in Merrill Lynch, getting these legacy issues to the extent it makes any type of economic sense for the shareholder behind us is a good thing and eliminates an element of uncertainty in your mind. And the last time I just said it\u2019s going to be the right decision for the shareholders and that's what we do day in and day out as we try to put these different issues behind us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Ed Najarian - ISI Group</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">The second question has to do with capital. It was only about a little over a year ago that one doctor was making an investment in your company and the chatter was all around the potential that has to build capital. Now all of a sudden we are looking at your capital ratios and thinking a lot about excess capital. </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I am sure you probably don't want to give us outlook and predictions in terms of capital return in conjunction with the CCAR, but can you give us a sense, you\u2019ve spend so much time in the last 18 months building capital, clearly there are shareholders that are obviously looking for dividend entries, some are looking for a stock buyback especially after looking at the capital ratios today. Can you give us any sense of how you are thinking about capital over the next 12 months above and beyond what's going to be used for internal loan growth? </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Those capital ratios are going to continue to build based on some of the guidance that you just gave us over the last 45 minutes, and there is going to be a lot of people interested in thinking about what, how your thoughts are around dividend increases and stock buyback for the next 12 months as those ratios continue to build.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">We will start the work on the CCAR process in 30 days or so when we get the information, and so we won't speculate on that. But I think starting up on the broader perspective, we have made it clear that the capital we have in this company has been sufficient based on all the work that we\u2019ve been doing in the last couple of years. We\u2019ve been cleared that the capital is sufficient to run the company and to support the company growth, and all the capital above that. </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">When we have to get the approval, we\u2019ll go back to shareholders, either as dividends or share [repurchasers] till we frankly build the capital levels that we, you know, there is no reason to retain the capital at all. So it's all your capital, it's all the shareholders capital, until we get to the levels that we can return it. It's on the balance sheet, in our tangible book value per share, which we focus on and growing and see that continues to grow, and then after we hit the levels, that would be SIFI buffer  plus minus whatever cushion that we feel comfortable impacts the CCAR. It's all going back in one way or the other way.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Ed Najarian - ISI Group</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And then just last question related to that and Brian, in your mind, there is still are some overhanging litigation issues. There is still up to $6 billion or mortgage repurchased related cost that you outlined. Are those things that sort of, at least in the near-term will make you a little bit extra cautious on capital retention relative to where we otherwise think you might be until you sort of get those litigation and repo issues more fully resolved?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">All I have to take account in the technical rules of [QR and AS] and in things that we look. But think about this quarter, we basically had a breakeven quarter, we passed a major milestone in putting behind a major piece of litigation, and the litigation expenses were $1.6 billion or whatever they were and we still built capital. </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So, it factors into it obviously, but on the other hand we have lots of ways to build capital and so, we are focused on getting the position that you suggest which is, that we start returning all the capital we\u2019ve promised, we have to get to the CCAR process and until we sort of see that we can\u2019t project on that, but in those processes and in our mindset all that is factored in, but if you look at the track record, we continue to build capital even though we\u2019ve been putting behind this major piece of litigation every quarter, on several quarters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">We\u2019ll go next to the site of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Hi, two question. One was on the hedge that you\u2019ve historically had on the [AOCI] book. Have you been changing the size of that and at this stage as well. </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I\u2019m sorry, I am cut out Betsy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So, do you have a hedge on the AOCI book, and I was just wondering if you still have that in place?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">On the overall securities book?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yeah.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yeah, as we\u2019ve said a lot of the longer duration fixed rates we do swap to floating to minimize the AOCI risk.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. And did you change the size of the hedge at all during the quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Nothing material within the securities book this quarter, no.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. And then separately, there are some regulators who are suggesting that the debt portion of the balance sheet from senior debt through lastly (inaudible) correctly should be somewhere in the 25% to 30% range, and I am wondering, if and I just have two question and I am wondering if you\u2019ve had any conversations with regulators about that, do you feel but there was anything that you would need to do in that side of the debt stack?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">It\u2019s something that\u2019s very topical. Even with the changes that we have made to our debt footprint. If you look at our debt footprint on any type of absolute and relative measure, relative to our peers we are at the high end which obviously from an expense perspective is not a good thing. So we are not going to predict what's going to happen going forward from a regulatory perspective, but I think given that we have on a relative basis more between parent and Merrill Lynch that our peers that will be able to manage that well and we look at maturities and over the course that next year we have maturities of about $30 billion of debt and we would expect to repay a large portion of that through cash that we generate and through the existing cash resources we have in the company.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay. So as we [evolve] through the next couple of years, we should see the same case of long term debt decline or in a little bit of deceleration into the next year or two?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">What I would model in is that a large portion of the maturities the way we lay those out will be taken out with existing cash not new long term debt. Periodically we will raise debt, we\u2019ve said 21 to 24 months time to funding that would tend to migrate you down to a liquidity at the parent level in the zip code of $75 billion to $80 billion and as we\u2019ve said, think 2013, think 2014, that the majority of that debt would be repaid with cash resources.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay. And then just lastly on capital, one of the capital rules has to do with holding a hair cutting against the CRM, I think it\u2019s an 8% hair cut or so. So when you talk about full model approvals, you are assuming that that hair cut goes away, is that correct?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I think you are referring to -- which model -- you referring to CEM?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Right.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">If we look at in the capital numbers that we quote, we've assumed CEM and IMM approval. And with the different work that we\u2019ve done, the spread between what our IMM numbers are versus our CMM numbers has gotten much higher. So to the extent any model where it take longer to get approved, we have reduced that risk significantly as we built capital.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">We\u2019ll go next to the side of Nancy Bush with NAB Research LLC. Your line is now open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Nancy Bush - NAB Research LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Two questions; on GWIM, the 20.1% pretax margin obviously depressed by the interest rate environment etcetera, etcetera. Is there a target operating margin there or is it somewhere we can sort of imagine a more normalized margin over the next years, because it seems like that business is sort of under contributing significantly at this point?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I think that you pointed out that one of the strategies is to increase margins in wealth management businesses overall has been to drive the loans and deposits along with the strong asset management business we have. And I think as rates normalize Nancy and I guess normal is going to be hard to define here for the near term, as they normalize you\u2019ll that value has come back up and that\u2019ll increase the pre-tax margin because we don\u2019t need to do any more work to gather that in i.e. on the deposits side specially.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">If you look at them, year-over-year they are down about 4% in expenses, (inaudible) banks run the two business for us, U.S. Trust and Global Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management have been working on expenses. So revenues here will be flat and expenses are down and they\u2019re continuing to work on a non-client facing expenses especially and they\u2019ll be a beneficiary of all that work, so I think that\u2019ll help the margins.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">But remember, that the core brokerage revenue which is at, and investment management revenue for the Merrill Lynch side as a group of the company is a lower margin business, our margins are better than anybody else, and so we\u2019ve got to continue to improve them. But we look for that to improve, but I\u2019d be careful about assuming, how much improvement, moving up 3%, 4% might be doable, but I wouldn\u2019t assume that it\u2019ll get back to a private banking style margin, because the dominance of the Merrill Lynch, the traditional brokerage revenue streams.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">The other thing is, in overall, so remember that we\u2019re selling the international GWIM which had low margin, which will help improve the margins going forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Nancy Bush - NAB Research LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay. One more question on the litigation front; we\u2019ve seen a couple of new lawsuits dumped on the banking industry over the past couple of weeks, you\u2019ve got the [settlement to] with JPM regarding stuff required in their sterns and then you\u2019ve got the Fed\u2019s of course suing Wells Fargo on FHA, way pre-crisis stuff. Are you guys vulnerable to either of those and have you already had provisions into various other settlements that you\u2019ve been involved in that would address any of those issues?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">As an industry, there is no question that there has been an increase in that activity, so by virtue of being in the industry you are out there, I think the one thing that\u2019s important and if you go back to our DOJ AG settlement and when we took the hit for about $500 million when we announced that settlement, it covered a lot of the FHA activity predating I believe it was sometime in the latter half of 2009. So that piece of it relative to others we have resolved several quarters ago, it was obviously, it was a big number to resolve, so we do have that one that\u2019s out there behind us whereas some others don't and it was one of the key parts of that settlement for us. So we\u2019re little different from that perspective and we will just have to see how the balance of it unfolds and if other things come up.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">We\u2019ll go next to the site of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Good morning. First a question on loan growth, what has commercial loan utilization done in this quarter versus the last quarter or two?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">It really, it\u2019s not so much that utilization of revolvers that has maintained and has remained in that loans 30s level. The loan growth that we\u2019re seeing is more actual funded loans that we\u2019re making as opposed to revolver draws.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And I noticed that commercial loans grew 14% annualized linked quarter and that the period end loans were up a lot more than the average loans. Is anything happening in the economy to accelerate that commercial loan growth, I guess at the end of the quarter or is this just Bank of America\u2019s specific strategy?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I think we have been pushing and looking to do more on the lending front for several quarters and we saw some of that materialize. And the one note I would Mike and we have it back in this slide, if you look at our banking segment, we did have one or two fundings at the end of the quarter that will get repaid during the fourth quarter. So it was a little bit accelerated in the fourth quarter, but even if you account to that back, we still saw very strong loan growth in the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Alright, there will be noise when we compare fourth quarter to third quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">It will be; but like I said, even without that, the growth was very strong.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And you said loan growth is a priority. Are you willing to lower rates in order to stimulate more loan growth?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">We\u2019ve been very disciplined and if you look in the supplement, and look at the average spread in our loan growth on the commercial side, that would be new originations and the spreads on that have remained at relatively flat on both on a quarter-over-quarter basis and while we want to make loans, but the loans that we make have to make economic sense and to have the returns on capital that are consistent with where we are taking the business, and the opportunities that we\u2019ve seen and the ability to grow the book are generating those returns and we feel good about it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And I think, you have to take a step back and look at the macro environment where here in the U.S. you\u2019ve got banks that are competing and given the large liquidity basis that we have and capital basis looking to get invested some of the loan growth and if you look at it outside of the U.S. as we see some of the different foreign banks pull back, the opportunities for us to grow our loan base where relatively speaking were smaller internationally, we are using the opportunity with the capital and liquidity that we have to take advantage of that and you can see it in some of the trade finance and other loan areas outside the United States.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Alright, so demand is not a whole lot better, you\u2019re not doing what\u2019s right to your gaining share from foreign banks; it might part of it anything else you want to add to that list?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">We referenced in the slide that in the real estate area, the first time in several quarters that we\u2019ve seen growth in commercial real estate. We shape that business down when things got tough to a level that we thought make sense from a risk perspective and we\u2019re now in a position to be able to start growing that. And, while we\u2019re focused on doing things with our customers, we\u2019ve seen one or two portfolios, not huge size that have come up that we\u2019ve been able to bring in and when we do that, the first thing that we look at in those portfolios are how much of the exposure of the portfolio is the people that we do business with and we would like to do more, and we\u2019ve had a couple of situations where we\u2019ve been able to bring those portfolios in and become more significant with clients that we want to become more significant with.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And then, switching gears, it was a good mortgage quarter. Are you holding any of the newly originated mortgages upon the balance sheet or are you securitizing and selling those immediately?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">A couple of points on that, the first is, we talked about loan growth within our Global Wealth and Investment Management area of a little over $2 billion on a notional amount for the quarter. A portion of that was mortgage lending that we do with that client base as well as securities base lending, so that there was some growth in mortgages within the GWIM space. Outside of the Global Wealth and Investment Management space, we are looking at starting to hold a little bit of conforming product where the product is priced and has the return that we think makes sense. So you may see in the fourth quarter and into the first quarter of next year holding a little bit more conforming product, but there was nothing material in that like during the third quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">But, I mean just which spreads the way they are, why would you want to hold any mortgage loans on the balance sheet?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Some of the mortgage loans were the mortgage loans that we make that in many cases tend to be more non-conforming, not conforming.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">But the non-conforming pricing can make sense and depending on the duration, some of the conforming stuff may or may not make sense. But your point is the right one and it\u2019s consistent with how we manage the different portfolios; we\u2019re not going to go out on the curve and take undue interest rate risk chasing yield in the short term.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And then last question, there has been some articles recently about Merrill Lynch hiring brokers from other financial advisors. Are we about to see a war for financial advisor talent; are you looking to be above your number of financial advisors or just a general strategy for expanding the (inaudible)?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">We have a change our strategy, we have, Mike we have been fairly consistent in how we have worked on it, so we basically hire financial advisors and we bring advisors in the business for our PMD and our FSA programs; but no change from our standpoint.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And next to the site of Paul Miller with FBR. Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Paul Miller - FBR</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Yeah, just to piggyback Michael on the mortgage banking side. You guys used to be very a large player in the mortgage banking; we know you\u2019ve exited both the wholesale and the corresponding business. But given where we are today and how profitable the mortgage banking space is, are you rethinking that a strategy, could you reenter the corresponding market or you\u2019re just planning to growth to the retail markets?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">We are not changing the strategy; we will continue to grow as we growing 14% this quarter and like the first quarter through the direct-to-retail. It's part of the focus of the strategy of the company to make mortgages to our customers and do a great job of it as oppose to buy closed loans in the secondary market. </p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Paul Miller - FBR</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">And so therefore, just the retail side, so how much market share you think you can gain on the retail side. I think you\u2019d probably be around 4% or 5%. Can we see it materially increase that or that\u2019s probably where you are going to set?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">We are 4% or 5% of the overall mortgage market. On the direct-to-retail we are higher than that because you take out the correspondent. But if you just look at the number of customers, that have a mortgage somewhere else, there are a lot of customers in our wealth management business or in our preferred business. The amount of mortgage growth we could have to be very strong and that will continue to build as we focus the sales teams on those efforts. </p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">If you look at the productivity of the mortgage loan officers we hired that worked with our teams and the branches and stuff, it is multiples of the productivity of people that are out working in the general fields. So as that business system continues to take hold, and even with the mortgage loan officers today, if we can get the loans process, we could close 15%, 20%, 25% more loans per day than we do today. </p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">So we got lots of room to grow in this business, but we\u2019re going to do it in a way which is focused on our client, with high quality loans, because of the economics of business do not support anything else.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Paul Miller - FBR</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Last question is your dispute with Fannie Mae, I believe you\u2019re not selling any loans of Fannie Mae, you are selling to Freddie Mac, which are both really run by the FHFA. Is the dispute with Fannie Mae at all hindering your ability to sell loans to the GSEs?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">I think we're growing faster than other people mortgage production on a quarterly basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">We will go next to the side of Glenn Schorr with Nomura. Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Glenn Shorr - Nomura</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Thank you, just two quick follow ups, and I appreciate all the disclosure, I just want to make sure I\u2019m trying to compare apples-to-apples. On the 8.97% that includes all model approval, when listening and looking at your disclosure it sounds like excluding model approval, it would be maybe 40 basis points lower at my end of the ballpark?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">I remember it would be slightly more of a reduction than that, but still below 100 basis points for IMM Glenn.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Glenn Shorr - Nomura</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Okay, perfect. I know it\u2019s early, but in just general gut check. What should we focus on more, with or without, as we approach CCAR? In other words, again, trying to put the whole industry on an apples-to-apples basis?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">With or without?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Glenn Shorr - Nomura</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">IMM approval?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">We are spending an enormant amount of time, making sure through the different government channels in the like that we will be in a position as quickly as possible to be IMM compliant, obviously nobody has been declared to be IMM compliant yet, and I don\u2019t want to speculate on becoming IMM compliant. </p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">I think the important thing is Glenn, if you look at the work that we\u2019ve done with respect to Basel 3, and you look at where we are relative to our peers, we\u2019re in very good shape and I think the CCAR piece, there is two things that you have to be mindful of, the first is that last year the state of CCAR results are where your Basel 1 Tier 1 [comment] is probably gets adjusted this year to be Basel 1 and half relative to a 5% reference rate. That is the CCAR test, the way it was done last year, and our sense is probably the way that it ends up being done this year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">That's the base test. The second test is the [glide] path and do you show a path to being where you need to be from a Basel 3 perspective. And that's why when we talk about capital, we are very focused on both of those measures and we feel like, we are in very good shape under both Basel 1 and Basel 3 at this point.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Glenn Shorr - Nomura</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">I appreciate that. Just want to make sure, I heard what I think I heard. Some of the mortgages you are originating are putting on balance sheet now obviously good credit, the customers because its originated from your channel, but when gain on sale margins are at all time highs, it feels as an outsider that it would make sense to be selling them in to the market, but curious on how you view that in balance sheet versus selling amount?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">I think what Bruce said is in the third quarter, we sold them out. We are looking at retaining some, but it would not be material amount relative to the overall production of our mortgage business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Glenn Shorr - Nomura</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Okay, I appreciate that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">The second things is you got to remember, we got a mortgage portfolio, runs off on the balance sheet today is $200 billion plus, so just to have that stay in place for lack of better term you have to fill it backup.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Glenn Shorr - Nomura</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Unless some wants to pay you a lot of money for it, but I hear you. Finally the focus on earnings growth and loan growth, I think you talked effectively at all the price competition. I am curious if the industry has the potential to be low to sleep in this low rate environment. </p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">So you mentioned that you are getting the same time of spread on new loan origination. It\u2019s coming out at a lower rate, but we are in a excellent credit environment right now, but curiously if we were to see it turning the other way, if you feel like the industry might be putting on loans that were being low to sleep on spread, but the rates actually can get eaten up pretty quickly if there is a turn in credit.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">The one thing that we\u2019ve not seen with loans coming is, historically when what you are referencing is the loans, it\u2019s the structuring of loans and credit quality of loans that you can bring on the balance sheet starting to be impaired in this chase for yield. </p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">The number of people globally that are looking to grow their loan books, you have to think globally is less than it's historically been, and when we're running the loan books, we're very focused on not just growing them, but making sure that the pricing returns out from a cost to capital perspective and that the structures continued to have integrity so that if what you just referenced happens, that we do not have losses that we're not comfortable living with. </p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">And at this point, given what we're seeing in the global competitive market, the ability to put loans on that make sense for us and have the structures that protect us, we continue to feel very good about.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">And when we think about the consumer side, even the loans originated in - up to the  standards were changed dramatically in \u201808 in terms of mortgage standards or even card standards in those \u201907-\u201908, and you start to look at loans originated in the latter half of \u201808 and \u201809 and now three years plus later in an environment three years plus later where I think the core environment would have been through and [planning] to be lower than it is now and economic growth to be higher based on what people thought at that time. </p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">We are seeing credit performance which is much better than the expected outcome. So we're always checking ourselves, and the question you raised which is how do we make sure that we drive the business and don\u2019t have credit issues going forward. </p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">What I\u2019ll tell you though, is that\u2019s where we want that we continue to frame this thing as how we run the company and focus on the core customer bases and do what they need and not just chasing growth for growth sake, and that then will keep us in things like the card business where in the past we may have drifted into credit that was more difficult from doing that, and we\u2019re happy with our card business it\u2019s growing strong, it\u2019s growing with the right customers with a high credit quality, we\u2019re not going to go reach for credit just to grow the business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Glenn Shorr - Nomura</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Perfect. I really appreciate it, thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">And we\u2019ll go next to the site of Vivek Juneja with JP Morgan. Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Hi, Bruce, hi Brian. Just a couple of quick questions, HARP, how much did that account for your volume in the third quarter? And\u2026\u2026..</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">The HARP volume was about 30% of the originations.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Okay. And how long further, how far do you think you are in the process and how much longer do you expect to be able to keep doing?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">I think we\u2019d expect that business to continue through the lion share of 2013.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Okay. Can you talk about the retail bank a little bit, it seems like, you are shutting branches but deposits continue to grow, can you talk a little bit about what\u2019s going on there, where you are getting growth from and the shutting of branches, where you are in that rationalization and despite that, it seems like you have been able to grow deposits quite a bit?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">So, let\u2019s think about it from all different points, which is, we need to bring the cost structure down so we\u2019ve been on a plan to continue to close branches and you can see that we did, again,50-60 this quarter and we\u2019ll continue to do that, we\u2019re doing it carefully. </p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">And as we close those branches the attrition we see is well within and less then we thought will be. So that's turning out to be good. So that's where the rate exposure is, so we are getting what we want. We are keeping the customers and that for less operating cost and that's a program that we\u2019ll continue carefully across and then each quarter will be a continuing progress.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">When you look at the core business, the things like the Durban were in last years third quarter not this year third quarter. So you are starting to see the run rate come out of the post, of all the regulatory changes in revenue sort of linked quarter stabilizing, given the changes in fees that have been behind us now for several quarters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Cap growth [continues] net new accounts. This mobile implementation were $11.1 million, 800,000 to subscribes this quarter, we are 1 million plus more then anybody else. But the good news is the cost impact of that or the service impact of that is, since we\u2019re allowing you to take a snap shot, you checked with almost [1.75 million] checks we\u2019ve gone through in literally a couple of months of operations on that in the third quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">The payments made out for that platform are now running $1 billion plus a week, and we\u2019ll probably do $60 billion of payments through that platforms this year, we have already done 40 some billion or [non-30].</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">And then the more important part is that's all cost optimization, service optimization, and our customer scores continue to increase each month we see, our satisfaction score, we continue see an increase. </p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">But importantly in the growth areas in the preferred segment, we continue to see strong growth there. We added about 500,000 plus clients from retail to preferred in other words upgrade and through depth of relationship which means we are bringing more than $50,000 in balances to it. </p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">So we are quite please that business the Merrill lynch growth, and so I think its working and its working in a balance between getting the cost down on the retail side, expanding in preferred side and then also managing the customer experience in the middle.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Our next is from the side of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">It\u2019s encouraging, certainly that you guys highlighted LAS expenses could come down next quarter, but is there a way to give us some magnitude so we can know how to model this.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">It\u2019s definitely no the same question, (inaudible). The best way is you are looking to model is in the third quarter, we staffed to solve or doing everything from a change in regulation, compliance as well as our own standards that we wanted to as it relates to how we both service as well as modify mortgages. </p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">There was incremental work that was done in the third quarter to get to that point. The best way to start and to go through the analysis is to look at the number of 60 plus day delinquent loans that we have, because those without question require the most amount of work. </p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Given where we are now, what we would expect going forward is that you would see the expenses trend down at the same rate that you see the 60 plus day delinquencies come down, realizing it's going to be lagged by one and probably two quarters. </p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">That\u2019s the best way to get a proxy for the manner in which you should see those expenses come down. As Brian said, anything unexpected that comes up from an expense perspective.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">There are two things. We got to make sure we do this right and that\u2019s why we had to build the staffing to make sure that we do the modification on a timely basis, and then secondly, getting in quarter-to-quarter, as you can see we're trying to guide you to long term, but the key thing is we are doing everything we can as the world comes down to get the resources down at the same pace. </p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">So, it is something we\u2019re absolutely focused on and we\u2019ll deliver it for you, but we just have to make sure we do the work right, handle the customers right, it is a very difficult time for people to go through what\u2019s going on, because all of these costs go to the modification, short sale, (inaudible) </p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">How much of that decline in 60 day delinquencies was due to modified loans and what\u2019s the [redefault] risk there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Overall, we\u2019ll get you some detail on that, but just conceptually each vintage of modifications perform better. So we\u2019ve gone from levels of what have been after maybe year\u2019s worth of modification back from \u201908 and \u201909 and \u201908. We\u2019ve been at this as long as people remember that we were running 50 and now we\u2019re running them in the 20, low 20s or high teens. </p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">So, the redefault rate has gone way down because the structure of the programs and frankly the duration time after the crisis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Okay. Just to make sure I understood, Brian I think you had said that, as far as the trajectory of the decline in expenses overall when you\u2019re looking at the entire thing at OAS taking a step back, moderate improvements in 2013, but the big lever there is 2014. Is that right or are we reading too much in to it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">No, I think I was saying, that you\u2019ll get the improvement sort of on a quarterly basis all though \u201913 and in \u201914 you\u2019ll have the run rate of all that accumulated and for you, in year-over-year comparisons, but it\u2019s going to come all during \u201913. </p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">We can debate about moderate when we are that [expense base]. The other question was discussing but it will come every single quarters, so it\u2019s not going to be held up and wait, it\u2019ll come as fast as it can.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">So the word we\u2019re getting out this quarter has to do with the clients and the 60 plus day in the second quarter into the third quarter came out in the third, and the third quarter comes out in the fourth, it will take just little time, because you actually have to finish the work, reassign accounts and go on. </p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">So it will come, it\u2019s not in quarter-by-quarter, it will come month-by-month, week-by-week all to the \u201813.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">And your number of modifications during the quarter was 40,000.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Kevin Stitt</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Operator, one final question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Absolutely sir, we\u2019ll take that final question from the site of Jefferson Harralson with KBW. Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Jefferson Harralson - KBW</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Okay, can you guys just remind us what your litigation cost were roughly per year recycle?</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">We\u2019ll probably get back to that. I don\u2019t know (inaudible). </p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Jefferson Harralson - KBW</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Was a long time ago.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">That seems like long time ago.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Jefferson Harralson - KBW</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">I just want to zero in a one line item which is on page four, the supplement (inaudible) being as other income, I heard you say something about that, they were from 600 million positive to 790 negative. Was some of that FBR or DVA or is that all in the [three account] here?</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">At the FVO switch and other income was roughly, it was 1.2 billion delta during the quarter. So that\u2019s it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Jefferson Harralson - KBW</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">Okay. Thank you very much guys.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">Thank you, okay. Well, thanks everyone for joining.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">And this concludes today's program. Have a great day.

Please note, today\u2019s call is being recorded.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">It\u2019s now my pleasure to introduce Kevin Stitt. Please begin, sir.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Kevin Stitt</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning. Before Brian Moynihan and Bruce Thompson begin their comments, let me remind you that this presentation does contain some forward-looking statements regarding both our financial condition and financial results, and that these statements involve certain risks that may cause actual results in the future to be different from our current expectations. For additional factors, please see our press release and SEC documents.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">And with that, let me turn it over to Brian.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you, Kevin and thank all of you for joining us on a busy day. In 2012, we laid out our four focused areas for the year: capital, managing our risks, reducing costs and driving our core business growth. In each area we achieved strong results this year and we\u2019re carrying that momentum forward as we look into 2013.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Let\u2019s start on page four of our presentation. We positioned our company with a strong balance sheet this year. Estimated capital ratios now are above current Basel III requirements and we\u2019ve seen improving credit quality. And as you know, we\u2019ve addressed many legacy issues that Bruce will talk about later.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">As a result (inaudible) of the company, the team has driving all year to now showing through more clearly as we look forward. We positioned our company to driving our core customer relationship strategy. That strategy continues to accelerate our growth by simply helping those people we serve with the financial advice. We positioned our company by reducing costs making our operations leaner and more efficient and investing in our growth initiatives at the same time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We continue to streamline our businesses. We focus it on the three customer groups that we talk about on each call, people, companies, institutional investors. But on page five we highlight some of the progress we made in the last quarter and last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">On the consumer side, our deposits continue to grow. Our retail mortgage production has increased by an average of 10% per quarter over the past three quarters. The pipeline today remains as strong as it was at the end of the third quarter. As you know, we continue to optimize our service network, our branch network as online and mobile banking numbers continue to increase. We\u2019re now averaging about 10,000 new mobile subscribers a day.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">In our preferred client area, the growth this year has been strong. Even today our brokerage assets in Merrill Edge were up 40% from a year ago.<br></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Moving to our wealth management business, U.S. trust and Merrill Lynch, those businesses had strong loan deposit, strong revenue growth this year and earnings and pretax margin were also at record levels. As we think about the companies, the corporations and middle market companies we serve across the country and around the world, our loan growth continues to expand, particularly in the second half of 2012.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Global banking and let loans of $288 billion, up from $265 billion at the end of June. Investment banking fees for these clients are strong. We maintain our number two market position. In the fourth quarter we had a leadership position in debt underwriting. As we move to our global markets business which serves institutional investors, our research capabilities continue to be recognized as the best in the world for a second straight year. As we look at 2012, sales and trading revenue did well in a relatively difficult environment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In 2012, our trading revenues were up 20% from 2011 excluding the impacts of the DDA. And we did that while we reduced the cost in this business by over 10%. So thinking about it and looking across every customer group we serve, you can see our strategy that we put in place continues to drive results. We continue to fine tune the strong core franchise focusing on those industry leading capabilities we have to serve our clients and customers in every area.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">While we are doing that, we continue to work on expenses. Bruce is going to take you through the highlights in a few pages. But if you think about it from the top we reduced our delinquent mortgage count which allows us to reduce our LAS expenses. We reduced our employee in each quarter in the last five and we\u2019ve done that while we continue to invest in our targeted growth areas.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Our strategies continue to work, we\u2019re seeing growth across all the core businesses. We\u2019re seeing that momentum continue to accelerate. So as we look forward to 2013 we\u2019re going to continue to drive this strategy and drive revenues of our company.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Thank you. And I\u2019ll turn it over to Bruce to take through the results in detail.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Great. Thanks Brian and good morning everyone. I am going to start on slide six. As you all saw this morning, we reported net income for the quarter of $732 million or $0.03 a share for the quarter. I want to spend a moment on the previously announced items in the geography on the income statement so that you can better under the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Reported revenues net of interest expense were $18.9 billion during the quarter. If you look in the bottom left hand corner of the slide, you can see our revenues were negatively impacted by five items totaling approximately $3.7 billion. Those items included a $2.5 billion charge for reps and warranties with respect to the Fannie Mae settlement, approximately $0.5 billion related to the clarification of our obligations under mortgage rescissions, negative DVA and FVO of approximately $700 million relating to the significant tightening of our credit spreads that we saw during the quarter and then a positive $700 million between change in the MSR valuation related to the servicing sales as well as our sale in our Japan joint venture.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">If we move to the right on the expense side, our expenses were negatively impacted by approximately $2.3 billion due to our previously announced independent foreclosure review acceleration agreement as well as approximately $900 million of litigation expense and $300 million of compensatory fees. In addition, during the quarter, we did have a positive net tax adjustment primarily related to tax credits that are associated with certain non-U.S. subsidiaries.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We turn to slide seven, a lot of numbers, I\u2019d like to draw your attention to three line items. The first deposits were $42 billion or 4% from the end of the third quarter to the end of the fourth quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">During the fourth quarter, we reduced our long-term debt footprint by approximately $11 billion but more significantly during all of 2012, our debt footprint came down by almost $100 billion or 26%. We accomplish that reduction in our debt footprint while our overall liquidity sources remained in the range of $370 billion to $380 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Turning to slide eight and looking at Basel 1 capital. Basel 1 capital declined during the quarter to a still very strong 11.06%. The decline was the result of our pretax loss as well as approximately $500 million of common and preferred stock dividends. In addition, during the quarter, our risk-weighted assets grew by approximately $10 billion. It is the strong growth that we saw in the investment and corporate bank more than offset the reductions in the consumer business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We turn to slide nine. Like to spend a few minutes on Basel 3 capital. We estimate that our Tier 1 common capital under Basel 3 on a fully phased-in basis would have been 9.25% at the end of the year. Our estimate once again assumes approval of all models with the exception of the change in the comprehensive risk measure for CRM after one year under the U.S. Basel 3 NPRs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">This 9.25% is a 28 basis point improvement over our estimate of 8.97% at the end of the third quarter of this year. While our Tier 1 common capital declined as a result of the pretax loss, lower OCI and higher threshold deductions. This was more than offset by a reduction in our risk-weighted assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Driving the RW decline during the quarter were lower exposures, particularly in consumer real estate and market risk improved credit quality and update of our recent loss experience in our models. We estimate that our Tier 1 common capital at the end of the quarter was $128.6 billion while our risk-weighted assets were approximately $1.4 trillion under Basel 3. As you all know, Basel 3 ratios are more sensitive to changes in credit quality, portfolio composition, interest rates as well as earnings performance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We turn to slide 10 and look at funding and liquidity. Our global excess liquidity sources were $372 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, down $8 billion from the prior quarter, driven by a reduction of our long-term debt footprint of approximately $11 billion during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">During the fourth quarter, we redeemed $5.3 billion of TRUPs in other long-term debt. You may have seen last week, we raised approximately $6 billion in the aggregate for $350 million in 10-year notes to take advantage of strong investor demand. As we look forward though, we do expect to continue to see long-term debt decline primarily through maturities, consistent with our overall goal of optimizing the cost associated with both our debt and capital. As we do so, we expect that our time to require funding will consistently remain above two years coverage and that metric at the end of 2012 was at 33 months.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On slide 11, net interest income, we reported an increase in net interest income from $10.2 billion in the third quarter to $10.6 billion in the fourth and an improvement in our net interest margin of about three basis points to 2.35%. As we consider that number, we benefitted during the quarter from less negative impact of market related premium amortization expense. We continue to benefit from the shrinkage in our long-term debt footprint as well as improved trading related net interest income. Partially offsetting those benefits were lower asset yield as well as lower consumer loan balances.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">If you just forget the market relating items that I just referred to we\u2019re in line with the estimated range of net interest income $10.5 billion before market related impacts we\u2019ve discussed our past earnings announcements. Given long end rate levels at the end of December, we estimate the quarterly net interest income may come in around a base of $10.5 billion plus or minus for FAS 91 and day count for the next several quarters. The impact of our liability management -- liability management actions and long-term debt maturities are expected to help offset headwinds from continued pressure on consumer loan balances, as well as the overall low rate environment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On slide 12, we highlight the results of our consumer and business banking. Earnings were $1.4 billion for the quarter, an increase of $143 million or 11% from the third quarter, driven by higher revenue more than offsetting higher non-interest expense. Service charges were lower due in part to our actions that we took around hurricane Sandy to further support our customers in the region. Average deposits increased more than $6 billion or 1.3% from the third quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On slide 13, we list some of the key indicators for our consumer and business banking for the quarter. In our deposits business, the average rate paid on deposits declined 3 basis points during the quarter to 17 basis points. Our mobile banking customer base reached 12 million which is an 8% increase from the prior quarter and up 31% from a year ago. We reduced banking centers as we continued to optimize the delivery network around customer behaviors.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Credit card purchase volumes for active account increased 7% from the fourth quarter of 2011. The U.S. credit card loss rate is at its lowest level since 2006 while the 30 plus day delinquency rate is at a historic low.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On slide 14, and before we get into legacy assets and servicing, we summarized the specific mortgage items that we announced on January 7, including our settlements with Fannie Mae, sales of mortgage servicing rights and the acceleration agreement on the IFR. During the quarter these items had a negative pretax income on fourth quarter LAS revenue of $2.6 billion and the expense category of $2 million resulting in an aggregate net income impact of $2.9 billion in LAS within our consumer real estate services segment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">If we turn to slide 15 now, we break out the two businesses within CRES, home loans and LAS. Home loans reported an increase in net income to $281 million while LAS reported a net loss of $4 billion, including the approximately $2.9 billion of items I just highlighted.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As you\u2019re aware, the home loans business is responsible for first lien and home equity originations within CRES. First mortgage retail originations of $21.5 billion were up 6% from the third quarter driven by refinancings and up 42% compared with retail originations of approximately $15 billion in the prior year ago quarter. You can see the same type of trend in our core production income, which is up from the third quarter and almost doubled results from a year ago.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As you know, we exited the correspondent business in late 2011, so correspondent, its originations are nonexistent versus volumes of approximately $6.5 billion a year ago. The MSR assets within LAS ended the quarter at $5.7 billion, up $629 million from the end of the third quarter, due in part to the valuation adjustments previously discussed related to the sale of MSRs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">MSR hedge results during the quarter were positive and we ended the period with the MSR rate at 55 basis points versus 45 basis points in the third quarter and 54 basis points one year ago.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">If we turn to slide 16, we showed the comparisons of certain metrics in legacy assets and servicing on a linked-quarter basis, as well as compared to fourth quarter a year ago to reflect the work done to reduce delinquent loans and find homeowners solutions. As you recall, legacy assets and servicing reflects all of our servicing operations and the results of our MSR activities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Total staffing in the quarter including contractors and offshore decreased approximately 9,000 from the third quarter. The number of first-lien loan serviced drop 7% in the quarter, while the number of 60 plus day delinquent loans dropped 17% to 773,000 units.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We expect this drop in 60 day plus delinquencies should have a positive impact on our staffing levels and servicing costs going forward, as we were fully staffed in the second half of last year to handle the various new programs and regulations.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We referenced our January 7th announcement of agreement to sell MSRs totalling $360, excuse me, $306 billion aggregate unpaid principal balance. This represents $2 million loans of which $232,000 are 60 plus day delinquent. To transfer these servicing rights are scheduled to occur in stages over the course of 2013 with the delinquent loans schedule to be transferred after the current loans.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Currently, we recognized approximately $200 million in servicing fees for quarter associated with these loans which is expected to decrease throughout the year as we actually transfer the servicing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">However, the impact on earnings from lower revenue is expected to be negligible for the year as we expect expenses to also decrease as we transfer the servicing especially the 60 plus day delinquent loans.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We believe our service 60 plus day delinquent loans at the end of 2013 maybe around 400,000 units versus 773,000 units at the end of 2012, a decrease of approximately 50%. That implies an additional decrease of 150,000 units beyond the 232,000 units that are expected to go with the scheduled transfer.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Given the projected declines in 60 plus day delinquent loans and notwithstanding, there being a one to two quarter lag between delinquent loan transfers and expense decrease, we believe we can get expenses in the fourth quarter of 2013 down by more than $1 billion from the $3.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2012, excluding the impact of IFR and litigation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On slide 17, we show outstanding claims at the end of December, but as you know a significant portion of GSE claims has been addressed in our settlement with Fannie Mae. If we exclude the rep and warrant amounts addressed in this settlement of $12.2 billion from GSE outstanding claims of $13.5 billion pro forma outstanding GSE claims would have been $1.3 billion at the end of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Total outstanding claims on a pro forma basis would then be $16.1 billion. Remember that the table reflects unpaid principal amounts versus the actual losses projected on the loans. Outstanding claims in the quarter from private-label counterparties increased approximately $1.7 billion from the end of September.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">In an anticipated increase in our aggregate non-GSE claims was taken into consideration when we developed our reserves at the time of the BoNY Settlement and we continue to review our assumptions on a quarterly basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Unresolved claims with monolines remain static as much of our activity with the monolines revolves around litigation issues. Reserves for representations and warranties at the end of the quarter increased to $19 billion of which $8.5 billion is associated with the BoNY Settlement and approximately $6 billion is associated with the GACs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We currently estimate that the range of possible loss for both GAC and non-GAC representations and warranty exposures could be up to $4 billion over accruals at December 31 compared to up to $6 billion over accruals at September 30. This decrease is the result of our settlement with Fannie Mae and the range of possible loss now principally covers non-GAC exposures.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On slide 18, in global wealth and investment management, earnings for the quarter of $578 million were up slightly from record results in the third quarter. The pretax margin was 21%. This quarter we did move two businesses that we agreed to sell, international wealth management and our brokerage joint venture in Japan to the all other segment, including the results in past quarters for comparability.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Overall client activity in the wealth management business in the quarter across all categories was quite robust and was aided by client actions due to the fiscal cliff. Period end deposit growth of approximately $23 billion and period end loan growth of $3.5 billion helped to offset the impact of the continued low rate environment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Ending loan balances were at record levels and long-term AUM flows of $9.1 billion were the second highest quarterly amount since the Merrill merger and the 14th consecutive positive quarter. Net income of $1.4 billion in global banking on slide 19 is an increase of more than 10% from the third quarter and reflects higher revenue and lower expenses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Average loans and leases increased $10.8 billion or 4% from the third-quarter with growth across C&amp;I, as well as commercial real estate. Average deposit balances increased $15.8 billion or 6% from the third quarter to $268 billion as our customer base continued to be very liquid. Asset quality continued to improve from prior quarters as we\u2019ve seen over the last year, NPAs dropped 20% to $2.1 billion and reservable utilized credit size exposure declined 11%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On slide 20, we outline our investment banking fees for the quarter. You can see that our debt underwriting area was about $213 million from the third-quarter to $1.078 billion in revenues and our advisory business was up approximately $80 million to $301 million for the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Corporation wide investment banking fees were up 20% from the third quarter and 58% from the year ago period. Debt underwriting fees were a record for the quarter and we believe number one on a global basis during the quarter. From an overall investment fee perspective we maintained our number two global ranking in net investment banking fees during 2012 based on Dealogic\u2019s data.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Switching to global markets on slide 21, earnings excluding DVA were $326 million. Excluding DVA in the UK corporate tax charge in the third quarter, net income decreased compared to the third quarter driven by lower sales and trading revenue, reflecting a seasonally slower fourth quarter. Sales and trading revenue, excluding DVA was down 23% from the third quarter, but improved substantially from levels a year ago.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Within our fixed area, excluding DVA, revenues of $1.8 billion decreased from $2.5 billion in the quarter primarily as a result of lower volumes and reduced client activity but were up $1.3 billion or 37% from a year ago. In equity, excluding DVA, results were flat with the third quarter as lower volatility and continuing lack of investor appetite for equity products kept volumes suppressed. Expenses declined from both the third quarter and the prior year primarily driven by lower personnel expense.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On slide 22, we\u2019ve shown you the results of all other which includes our global principal investments business, the non-U.S. consumer card business, our discretionary portfolio associated with interest rate risk management, international wealth management business we agreed to sell insurance as well as our discontinued real estate portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">The revenue improvement in all other from the third quarter was mainly due to a lower negative valuation adjustment on structured liabilities under fair value option of $442 million compared to a negative $1.3 billion in the third quarter and higher equity investment income as a result of the sale of our brokerage joint venture in Japan.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Non-interest expense declined compared to the third quarter due to lower litigation costs as the third quarter included the Merrill Lynch class action settlement. Also contributing to net income in the quarter was the foreign tax credit benefit that I mentioned at the beginning of the presentation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">As you can see on slide 23, total expenses increased compared to the third quarter but were down from a year ago. Excluding LAS expenses, the independent foreclosure review and litigation expenses in the quarter were $13.3 billion versus $12.9 billion in the third quarter and $14.7 billion a year ago. The $400 million increase from the third quarter reflects the normal seasonal trend and represented non-personnel costs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">FTE at the end of the quarter was down approximately 5000 from the third quarter and 15,000 from a year ago. An important driver behind the reduction of $1.4 billion in expenses from fourth quarter a year ago is new BAC which we have discussed with you several times.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">If you remember total annual cost savings targeted with new BAC are $8 billion per year or $2 billion on a quarterly basis, which we said we would hit sometime in mid-2015. In the fourth quarter, we achieved approximately $900 million of the $2 billion which is 45% of our target. As a reminder, the first quarter every year include the annual retirement eligible stock compensation, which was $900 million in the first quarter of 2012 and this year we expect will be a similar amount plus or minus.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">While we\u2019re talking about expenses, let me comment on taxes. Tax expense for the quarter was a benefit of $2.6 billion, consisting of the expected tax benefit of the pretax loss, our recurring tax preference items and the $1.3 billion primarily related to the non-U.S. restructurings. For 2013, we estimate the effective tax rate to be somewhere around 30%, including $800 million or so for another expected 2% U.K. tax rate reduction which we would expect in the third quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">We switch to overall credit quality on slide 24. Provision was $2.2 billion versus $1.8 billion in the third quarter as lower charge-offs were more than offset by lower release. Overall credit quality trends continue to be positive even when we normalize for the events in the third quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">If you recall regulators provided new guidance to the industry in the third quarter of this year around loans discharged as part of a Chapter 7 bankruptcy which resulted in increased net charge-offs of $478 million in the third quarter. In addition, we incurred charge-offs of $435 million in the third quarter in connection with the National Mortgage Settlement. We do not have impacts to net charge-offs of a similar magnitude in the fourth quarter but did have $73 million related to the completion of the implementation of the regulatory guidance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Excluding these items, net charge-offs were down $178 million or 6%. We believe most portfolios are close to stabilization and overall reserve reductions are expected to continue but at reduced levels. Given our outlook for slow growth but healthy economy, we believe provision expense in 2013 will range between $1.8 billion and $2.2 billion per quarter, the levels experienced between the second and fourth quarters of 2012.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Excluding the fully insured portfolio, 30 plus day performing delinquencies continued to drop. NPAs were down $1.4 billion from the third quarter and $4.2 billion from a year ago. On the commercial side, reservable criticized levels showed a decline of 8% from the third quarter and 42% from a year ago.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Before we open up for questions let me say and reiterate Brian\u2019s comments that we feel very good about our accomplishments in 2012. We improved the balance sheet, we managed risks and we addressed significantly -- significant legacy issues and were successful in reducing certain of our exposures. We stepped up our focus on growing the business and some of that focus is evident this quarter when you look at deposit growth across the franchise, loan growth in the global bank, solid investment banking results and in GUM, strong deposit, AUM and loan flows.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">We entered 2013 all about moving the ball forward and winning in the marketplace with what we think is the best banking franchise in the world. And with that, let me go ahead and open up for questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"></p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p7\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">(Operator Instructions) And we\u2019ll take our first question from the side of Matt O\u2019Connor from Deutsche Bank.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">A couple of follow-ups, I guess starting on the expenses, appreciate the outlook on legacy costs. As we think about sort of the all other expenses that you pointed to of $13.3 billion with some seasonal stuff this quarter. Maybe you could just frame what we can expect for that level or for that bucket for 2013.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong><br></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">You\u2019re saying expenses not including LAS and litigation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Exactly. Yeah the 13.3 billion that you pointed to in the fourth quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">I think as you look at that number and if we keep LAS out of this, obviously that the big new savings bucket that we have is new BAC. We\u2019d indicated that we are on a quarterly basis at $900 million a quarter. As we leave 2012 we expected that our new BAC cost savings when we get to the fourth quarter of \u201813 will be at $1.5 billion per quarter. So you could expect to see on a core basis of new BAC of about $600 million increase from where we leave 2012 to where we leave 2013.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank</strong><br></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So as we think about that $13.3 billion, I guess if we just take out $600 million for new BAC but was there other bulk or how much I guess of the seasonal stuff is there that you may wish to adjust for?<br></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">But the seasonal stuff that you\u2019re going Q4 to Q4 you\u2019d expect the seasonal stuff to be there, but as we indicated we looked at and for this quarter relative to the third quarter there was $300 million to $400 million of stuff that we would characterize as seasonal.<br></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And just in terms of like underlying call it inflation or just normal investments, if we take that 13.3 4Q to 4Q, would you expect that to be down so you have kind of minus $600 million from additional BAC savings? I know there are always some offsets from inflation or investments, do you think that net number will be down?<br></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">We would expect that -- the one thing that we\u2019re being very cognizant of is that while we\u2019re investing in the business, we\u2019re not going to let inflation out-run the progress that we\u2019re working on new BAC. So if you think on a net basis thinking about that $600 million from new BAC is a good assumption.<br></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And then separately, if we look at the fixed revenue, little weaker than maybe we\u2019ve seen so far although it\u2019s still early in the earnings process this year. And I guess I noticed that the asset level in the trading book went up, the VaR doubled quarter to quarter, and just wondering if there is anything unusual in terms of positioning or that you point to?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I think it\u2019s important when you look at the fixed business, to go back and look at the progress that we\u2019ve made during 2012. If you look at fixed revenues 2012 compared to 2011, pre-DVA they were up 36% year-over-year. If you go back and look at each of our quarterly releases in 2012, in each quarter 2012 pre-DVA revenues were higher than 2011, at the same that we were taking costs out.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">The third thing I would say is that you\u2019ve to realize that we run the fixed in overall debt underwriting business and look at that as one consolidated business and from a debt underwriting perspective at over $1 billion of revenue, we believe that was as I indicated earlier more than anyone else did this quarter on a global basis. And so we feel very good about that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">You point on the VaR, is a fair one and we did see VaR increased during the fourth quarter, and we would expect to see the benefits of that VaR flow through during the first quarter this year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Sorry, benefits meaning higher revenue?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">That\u2019s correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. All right. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">We\u2019ll go next site of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yeah. Hi. Bruce, does the goal of reducing the delinquents in LAS the 150,000? Does that include planned -- additional planned MSR sales that you might have in mind?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">It does not John, because I think the one thing when we announced these sales but you have to realize is that, it\u2019s very important that the transition of the loans that are being sold work through a process in going away that as consumer friendly as we can do it. So there is a lot of work that goes through that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So as we look at the servicing business that does not include in any meaningful way incremental sales there maybe some small ones or above that. And at the same time, somebody could come and look to do something as well, but at this point I would consider that 150 to be more organic reduction.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. And what kind of pace throughout the year would you expect for reducing that $3.1 LAS expense by your goal of $1 billion by the fourth quarter, kind of steady throughout the year or is it lumpy?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I would assume that you should generally expect it to come out throughout the year. It\u2019s not something you\u2019re going to have to wait for the fourth quarter to say.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. And then getting to Matt\u2019s question earlier, if we just -- a lot of moving parts on your expenses, if we look top of the house, trying to think about the jumping off point for total BAC expenses, you start the first quarter, it seems like you might be in the $17 billion ballpark with the stock option expense? Does that feel like the right area?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yeah. I\u2019m hesitant John to give you specific numbers in the quarter. What I would say is that, we gave you guidance is to how much of the fourth quarter with seasonal that we obviously wouldn\u2019t expect in the first quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">You\u2019ve got the 900 of stock compensation expense that will come through, expect to see a little bit of benefit in the first quarter as we continue to implement new BAC and probably the biggest variable that you could see in the first quarter that I didn\u2019t mention is really compensation expense that varies based on actual business performance. But I think if you think and look at those different metrics you get pretty close.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. And then with the Fannie settlement this quarter, how should we think about the rep and warrant provisioning going forward here, will you need to add on a quarterly basis to the rep and warrant provision?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yeah. I mean, if you look back over course of 2012, absent any settlements or any unusual activity, you had a run rate throughout the quarter of around $300 million per quarter in 2012. And with the Fannie settlement, as well as obviously the fact that Freddie was settled at Countrywide, you\u2019d expect that number to be $150 million or so going forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. And then, one last thing on NII, was that a pretty clean number, was there any impact from hedging or premium amortization in the NII number this quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">There was a less than $100 million to the negative.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. And your guidance of the kind of $10.5 billion is the run rate you think for the next couple of quarters that\u2019s excluding any of that, right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Excluding any of that and realize that we\u2019ve got a couple less days in the first quarter of this year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. Okay. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thank you, John.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">We\u2019ll go next site of Paul Miller from FBR Capital Markets. Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Hey. Thank you very much. Hey guys on your guidance for NII which was really good. You talked about a steady, I mean, you can maintain that 3 -- that net interest margin at current levels. What about average earning assets? Are you -- do you think you can maintain your average earning assets at these levels or grow them?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Well, I think, the average earning asset levels that you probably at a level that you\u2019re not going to see an enormous amount of growth. What we do hope that happens though is that the composition of those earning assets change so that we can look at and particularly in the institutional business that I mentioned, as well as in GWIM there was very strong loan growth during the fourth quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">We are focused on continuing to drive that forward and that obviously reduces the need to invest in securities and other thing, and we think ultimately has a positive impact on NII and is also quite frankly consistent with managing OCI risk going forward.<br></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And then I had to ask one mortgage question. I asked the same question in the third quarter but I think Brian, you\u2019ve been out in a lot of interviews talking about how much you like mortgage banking. But you\u2019re still really going to be focused on retail, am I correct? And on retail, are we focusing just your own customers or are we being focusing on customers outside of your deposit mix or your customer base?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Paul, focusing it on the customers in our customer base is not real restricted into one or two household. There is plenty of market share to go. Our penetration of the product to -- in our preferred segment and our wealth management segment is still relatively low. So there is tremendous growth. But as you think about shape in the mortgage business, we\u2019re kind of -- this quarter kind of moves -- starts moving announcing as we closed these servicing sales to where we end up maybe 5 million surplus loans going forward producing $20 billion and growing our core direct to retail, and that\u2019s kind of what we want with the market share that steadily grows and that\u2019s kind of the equilibrium and the same as we go. So the next challenge ahead is obviously while replacing the hard volumes over the next year, this year we had to replace the core fund of volume, next year we have to replace the hard volumes. The team is working diligently on that. It is really focused on the core customers, and if you think about the cost of servicing mortgages and stuff, we need to really focus on people that we\u2019re very comfortable with credit and keep the delinquencies down and stay away from the stray products and just stay on volume.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We\u2019ll go next to the site of Glenn Schorr from Nomura.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">First one is a question on risk weighted assets, on one of your slides you show Basel I assets going actually up a little in the quarter, Basel III coming down, it\u2019s all in the net change in credit and other risk weighted assets. I am just curious what do you see on the credit side that drives that model enhancement. The reason I ask is it makes sense intuitively it\u2019s just different to the tune of half the Basel I and Basel III jump, it\u2019s different versus all the other big banks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">It\u2019s a good question, Glenn. When you look at and let\u2019s just first spend a minute on Basel I. As I think you know that the majority of regular rate loans in Basel I are 100% risk weighted so that as you look at our $10 billion increase in risk weighted assets under Basel I it\u2019s just generally speaking the net increase in our loan book. If you go to Basel III and I think you\u2019re referring to slide 9, where we talk about the different reductions, why don\u2019t I spend a moment on each of the buckets. The first is that we referenced that we had about $23 billion less through consumer real estate exposures and the way the Basel III works is that as opposed to these general risk weighted buckets, they look at loan to value delinquency and other type metrics. So during the quarter the $23 billion benefit we saw, we saw declines in the loan to value within our residential mortgage book, the percentage of loans that were 90 plus day delinquencies, each of those went down which I think in large part is reflective of the changes in the underwriting standards that we\u2019ve talked about before that we implemented in the fourth quarter of \u201808 and first quarter of \u201809.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">The second thing is if you look at our home equity book, the delinquencies as well as the loan to value continued to improve there as well as the notional amount outstanding has also gone down, so we benefit there as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And then the third bucket within consumer real estate are other retail exposures which generally represent the run-off portfolio that we talked about, that decreased during the quarter as well. So those three different buckets within the consumer exposure are what drove the $23 billion decline there. If you move to the $64 billion number that we referenced largely in market risk really go through a couple different areas where we had benefits.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">The first is we did have a pretty significant decline on a net basis of CBA stress VaR as well as our CRM risk weighted assets during the quarter. Over and above that, as you know that some of the securitization products cover very or have very high risk weighed asset content. We were able to incur -- fairly significantly decrease some of those securitization exposures. And during the quarter, the industry also got some guidance from a regulatory perspective on risk-weighted assets with certain securitization products that was favorable so that helped.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And then, the last piece that we had is that there were some index tranches and other things within the markets business, which came down pretty significantly as well. So those were really the big items in the $64 billion bucket and then with respect to the $23 billion bucket.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I want to spend just a moment on that because the $23 billion reduction is not a function of going in and changing models, the $23 billion is that each year when you update your models for actual loss experience, it drives changes in risk-weighted assets and given the strength and improvement across the credit portfolios in 2012, we benefited from that when the models were updated.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">As you look forward, I would just say looking forward I think we\u2019re generally in a place now where we told you a couple quarters ago, the optimization on Basel 1 was largely done and the risk-weighted assets would vary pretty proportionately with the amount of loans.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">From a pure risk-weighted asset perspective, I think we\u2019re largely through those reductions but keep in mind from a numerator or a common perspective going forward, we will benefit given our deferred tax position in that pretax number will generally grow capital on a pretax basis. And we still do have some threshold deductions, we can work down there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">That\u2019s super helpful. I think you just said but I just want to confirm, this happens on an annual basis, in other words whether the balance has come down on paydown runoff charge-off whatever or credit improves, the models get updated on annual basis and there is no permission process, in another words just happens in real time?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Well, there is not a permission aspect to it. It\u2019s required that we update these on an annual basis. So that\u2019s correct, Glenn.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. Really appreciate.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Glenn, the balances move every quarter. I think it\u2019s the models -- the factors that change on risk.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">That\u2019s super helpful. I appreciate all of that. Inside the average balance sheet, the securities yield went up 11 basis points in the quarter. Most banks are trending lower as things runoff. This is part of your depending the NIM so I get it. Just curious, is it just expanding a little bit on the duration curve. Just curious what you\u2019re doing on the asset side to help support those yields?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">No, it\u2019s not extending duration. If you look at our securities portfolio, we continue to run that duration in and around two years. What you have to keep in mind is that we had during the third quarter, you had some of the FAS 91 amortization expense. That flows through it and hits the yield on the securities portfolio. So we did not see a significant change in the actual yields during the quarter, it\u2019s really more FAS 91.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And I think as you look at our company going forward, I think we\u2019re a little bit different in that between the fact that the duration of what we have continues to be short. As we look forward, we clearly think the worst of the recouponing of the securities portfolios behind us based on where rates are to that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. Thanks Bruce. Appreciate it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">We go next to site of Ed Najarian from ISI Group. Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Ed Najarian - ISI Group</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Good morning, guys.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Ed Najarian - ISI Group</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">You know with the capital ratios up significantly and credit quality getting better, the mortgage repurchase risk getting resolved over time. Could you give us any thoughts in terms of how you\u2019re thinking about capital return for 2013? We\u2019ve had a number of the other big banks, JPMorgan, Wells, USB. At least give us some insight in terms of how they\u2019re thinking about capital return for this year going into the C-Cor, wondered if you\u2019d be willing to do the same? Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I think I\u2019d say that that we completed our results. We\u2019re in a better position this year than last year and we\u2019ll let you know once we get through the test. I think it\u2019s -- the Fed is doing it\u2019s work and -- but we\u2019ve included people that -- here the issue for us is not necessary capital levels, balance sheet cleanup and stuff, it is the issues of occurring earnings levels, consistent on that and we\u2019ll let you know once we get there. But Bruce and the team have done a great job on submitting it and we will see what happens.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Ed Najarian - ISI Group</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I think you already above the capital ratios that you need to be at, always according to FASB guidelines, now that you are generating -- continue to generate excess capital, is that something that you think you\u2019d like to return to shareholders over time? Or is that something that needs to be retained in the near term for safety and soundness reasons until you get more litigation resolved? Or any thoughts in terms of the excess, above and beyond where you have indicated you sort of intend to run the company?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">If you look at what we did in 2012, we took capital and redeemed preferred instruments and subordinated debt and other things and continued to do that during the year, we\u2019d be getting approval to do so as we went along. So we\u2019ve been clear to all the capital that we have now that we\u2019re above the levels, we will be in a position when we get the approvals to return to the shareholders. And there will be points of the relative preferences of the CCAR process in terms of dividends versus stock buybacks and things like that. So we would be no different than anybody else. But it\u2019s clear it\u2019s either on the balance sheet, tangible book value, it\u2019s not needed for the risk of the balance sheet as you can see that with all the risk weighting and everything, there capital is there. And all get returned as part of the business proposition.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">If we retain and need to grow, that\u2019s actually a good problem and I did but so far we have -- still have optimization left in the balance sheet as Bruce described, that will allow to return capital. Our intention is that -- the question is we\u2019ve got to get to the process and then we will do it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Ed Najarian - ISI Group</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And then I guess my second question is just fairly technical. But when I look at your -- what you\u2019ve outlined in terms of reserve recapture, it looks like about $900 million in terms of loan loss reserve, a $2.2 billion provision and $3.1 billion charge-offs. But it looks like the loan loss reserve itself dropped by about $2 billion from the third quarter. Can you reconcile that for me?<br></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yeah, the reason is it dropped by that amount is that and you saw it in the third as well as the fourth quarter that some of the DOJ AG settlement modification and other things, that is as you dispose, get repaid or write off the purchase credit impaired portfolio, it reduces your loan loss reserve.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Ed Najarian - ISI Group</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And then that\u2019s not coming through the charge-off line?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">That\u2019s correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">We\u2019ll go next to the site of Brennan Hawken with UBS.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So a quick one following up actually on one of Ed\u2019s questions. And it\u2019s related to your capital levels and the SIFI buffer. Is there any view from your guys\u2019 perspective that you will intend to run with a buffer above the required 8.5% because many of your money center competitors are going to be running at the 9.5% level. So maybe either for funding market reasons or potentially competitive reasons, is it in your mindset or strategic vision that you might run a bit above that 8.5% level or is that the wrong way to think about it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I\u2019d make a couple of observations on that. The first is that at 9.25% today regardless of required SIFI buffers, we have more on the Basel III basis than anyone else. The second thing I would say is that given the position that we are in, in fact, we do have on PTAs going forward, the rate at which we accrue capital given that it\u2019s on a pre-tax basis, we would expect to be more significant than our peers. So I think going forward we still think we have the opportunity as core earnings rebound, grow capital more quickly than our peers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">As it relates to the exact level, we\u2019ve always looked at and thought that you would want to run at least an extra 50 basis point cushion given that these ratios are more sensitive to changes in the market depending on what the market looks like at the time your ratio. You may vary that a little bit based on the market but I would say generally if we look at the -- what we saw in the third quarter, what we saw today that we\u2019re generally in the range of where you expect us to run. And as we look out at and see how our counterparties from a credit perspective view the company now and look at our credit spreads we feel like we\u2019re doing the right things right now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yeah. Okay. That\u2019s fair. And then thinking about maybe the fact that you guys might be in the market to sell another chunk of MSRs at least we hear about that through speculation from various sources. It -- is the idea behind that, we are at a point where that\u2019s not really a capital issues for you all anymore, right, because you are below the threshold from that perspective. So is it more about getting an opportunity to further eliminate and push down these legacy costs or is it that you just strategically don\u2019t view the business is very attractive and you just want to be out of it all together? Can you help -- maybe give some color around that thought process?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So, if you go back and look what we did in the beginning of \u201811 when we split, we split our portfolio into two thought processes, our mortgage servicing portfolio. We split a chunk into what we called the home loans at that point and a chunk into what we called LAS. And it was about round numbers $11 million, $12 million of loans at that time, half went to LAS and half went to home loans.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And the criteria which we look at that was customers\u2019 products and loans and stuff that were going to be a go-forward business, we think of in the home loans business and the other half was products that were never going to be done again. And the way we\u2019re going to run the business because, frankly you lose a lot of money on them due to the delinquency levels and customer strike et cetera.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So since that time we have -- and if you go back and look, we showed that exact rate. Since that time, we\u2019ve been busily trying to work the $6 million non-core loan book portfolio down and we got it down around $2.5 million-ish now and with the sales to $2 million, not all of it comes out that because of combined pools and stuff but a significant amount.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">We are really accelerating the ability to get to the end state on the bad mortgage servicing book for lack of better return. And that is what we\u2019re up to. We had gotten at the level from a capital level and all that stuff we\u2019re comfortable with. And so once we get this out -- these are products that we just aren\u2019t going to continue with and we\u2019ve been focusing on rebuilding the business into the core business as I spoke about earlier.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So, if you think about in that context, think about something that might have taken us all the way into \u201815 to finish up and think about through the sales of the significant part of the $2.5 million, how much we can -- the question is, we are bringing that in into \u201813 and nearly \u201814 as we finish up which then accelerates our position of our company away from products and services which we didn\u2019t plan to continue two years ago.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. Thanks for that. And then last one, the $1 billion decline in mortgage cost, the legacy cost you guys provided from the $3.1 billion to the $2.1 billion by 4Q, just kind of curious about the starting point there, the 3.1, I thought that included $0.3 billion of compensatory fees from this Fannie deal. So, why is that the starting point rather than like 2.7? Is there something in that $0.3 billion that is recurring or what\u2019s the deal there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">The number was slightly less than 300. It rounded to that number. But in any one quarter in that business, you have some plusses and some minuses that are flowing through. So you\u2019re right, the $1 billion though is starting from a $3.1 billion base.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Let\u2019s be clear. We are still working through. We signed the sales transaction January 7th working through the buyers and timing of the movement of the assets and finalizing that, then how fast you can move. There is transition issues that you got to deal with in terms of people or intermittently modification process and stuff.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So, but let me flip to the other thing. This quarter the total resources you saw on one slide dedicated to LAS went down by 9,000 between FTEs and contractors that are dedicated to this team. We will continue to drive that down. There is nothing more important to our company than to get this done as quickly as possible.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So, Bruce has given you the outline and whether it\u2019s in this called item or that item, the idea is that we need to get the work out of here and that\u2019s would actually take the cost and the sales closing the continued progress on the remaining pieces that we have left. But think about, say single quarter, 9,000 change in headcount and think about -- we\u2019re going as fast as we can.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So, clearly it\u2019s been really tough to try to forecast and how this would rundown and you guys are clearly not alone in having challenges. Everybody in the industry I think has been struggling with that. So, just was kind of curious whether or not there was something in there to better understand it. Thanks for giving the color.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">We\u2019ll go next to site of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Hey, good morning. Couple of other questions on mortgage. One is around the Fannie settlement. So, now you will be originating through Fannie as you used to really weigh mortgages for the home loans section. I\u2019m wondering, how fast you think you can get your market share back up as a result of that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Our market share overall when you put the whole thing together I think has gone up about two tenths of a percent per quarter is the best I have and remember we are only competing in the direct-to-consumer part of the market. So I think it\u2019s moved from 4.2 to 4.4 to 4.6 type of numbers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And so we expect us to keep driving our market share up. Now again we\u2019ve got the HARP volumes which is in the $21 billion, this quarter is $7 billion to $8 billion type of number think of that, that we got to replace.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And so that\u2019s the team challenge and on the other hand we are not closing loans as quickly as we should honestly and we\u2019ve been adding significant resources as we have downsized LAS into the home loans business to increase our fulfillment capacity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So you put all of it together, our market share continues to grow every quarter, the last three or four, we\u2019ll continue to drive it. Where it will settle in, I\u2019m not exactly sure but as I have talked about earlier that\u2019s if you think about us having about -- think of an 8% share of servicing, we got to get our origination share moving towards that direction over the next couple of years in order to have sort of equilibrium for lack of better term.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Right. It\u2019s just that when you stopped originating through Fannie, the share came down rather sharply in a short period of time. So I was just wondering if, with higher throughput, you might be able to do more there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Well, look, to the issues in liquidity in the market and the kind of loans going through, the issue was when we -- they happen to correspond to each other but they had really nothing to each other. The issue is we stopped the correspondents. As you thought about our market share, when it was at its strongest in the high teens, two-thirds of it or more were correspondents. And that\u2019s what brought our share down, the retail market share is actually -- from this year our direct to retail including even HARP, it\u2019s flat year over year in terms of production and fell little bit and has grown every quarter. So we\u2019re selling to Freddie and we will work it out with Fannie over time but the point I am really saying is it\u2019s not the secondary market liquidity that caused our markets to drop, it\u2019s getting out of the correspondent business. </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And if you just look in this quarter, remember there is a 6.5 billion last year fourth quarter versus this quarter -- this year fourth quarter was in the correspondent that was a carryover when we quit it in the third quarter, at the same time we announced that we\u2019re going to stop the thing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And then lastly on home loans, should we expect -- are you anticipating more reinvestment in the home loans group to drive that faster throughput or do you think you are at the investment spend that you want to make in that business?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Of the volumes there we continue investments in the servicing fulfillment teams, we moved to -- Tony Meola has done a great job and Ron Sturzenegger in that business working through LAS has now taken over sort of the good side of production along with a fellow named Steve Boland, Dean Athanasia in the retail and the preferred group under David Darnell drives the production side. We have added mortgage loan officers every single quarter focused them on the branches that we\u2019re seeing a tremendous uptick when we get them working with our teammates. We\u2019re better or more connected as a company and cross things, and so we\u2019ve seen it, and we are investing both on the front end and on the servicing and fulfillment, the middle office so to speak.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And we moved I think 4000 increase this year so far to fulfillment and we will move some -- we will continue to move them because ultimately this -- the retail production side is a good business right now. </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And we\u2019ll go next to the site of Nancy Bush with NAB Research LLC. </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Nancy Bush - NAB Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">First question, on the credit card business, Brian, could you just give us some color about what\u2019s going on right there? I mean your numbers are not robust and I am wondering -- I know you have lost share there. What\u2019s being invested into that business?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So as we think about starting in 2009, Nancy, we started to reposition that business because it\u2019s gotten too far into the broader credit and that\u2019s the crisis, remember we charged off $60 billion, $70 billion in that business. We start repositioning it, we\u2019ve got about now where we wanted. In other words, we have a definitive group of businesses that\u2019s very core and we like a lot. And we have the core business. So this quarter I think we did 840,000 cards and about 350,000 more or less through the franchise and another 700 some thousand I think online.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So we\u2019re producing what we need to do. Balances grew point to point, got to be careful for the fourth quarter you get a little kick around Christmas obviously. But if you look at it, we look across the last few quarters and (inaudible) we get out this quarter, we are holding around 14-ish percent market share which is fine. So now the question is we pushed a little bit hard on the, and I use the broad context marketing, not direct mail market but marketing driving to the franchise. So what we have done to position the credit quarterly, well it\u2019s a much more repayment business, now 19% plus pay rate which is basically up from 14, probably six or eight quarters ago. And so it\u2019s a higher quality business, it\u2019s drilled the core customer base, the one to three card and the rewards card we have drilled up the core platform are working well on the retail segments and then obviously in the wealth management segment, we have a greater rate of products. So we are -- I would say that we got to where we wanted now, it\u2019s stabilized the run-off book that we are fighting on our growth basis down to $3.5 billion, down from 15. I think they should start to see some growth but it will take -- it\u2019s going to bump around to where it is right now for few quarters. But I\u2019d say there\u2019s nothing wrong with business and we\u2019re making a fair amount of money right now. The risk adjusted margin is its highest it\u2019s ever been.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Nancy Bush - NAB Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Secondly, Bruce, if you could just speak to the comp ratios in the investment bank and how you guys are trying to position yourself relative to your competition?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Yeah, I think generally we\u2019re in that 40% area from a compensation perspective, and obviously given the performance and where we are we need to be competitive with where peers are. But I don\u2019t think you\u2019d really see that changed materially during the course of 2012. </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Nancy Bush - NAB Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Great. Thank you. </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">We\u2019ll go next site of Mike Mayo with CLSA? Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Hi. First just a follow-up, the FAS 91 amortization expense, what would have been the change in the securities yield and the margin if not for that, looking third quarter to fourth quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I want to get back to you with that exact number, Mike. I think, I have got, but I want to make sure I\u2019m right. So why don\u2019t we get back to you with that number?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay. Do you just generally, I mean, because your margin was up, that\u2019s good and the securities yield is up 11 basis points, but do you think it was -- would have been down if not for that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I want to think, Mike, it was somewhere between 9 and 11 basis points. I just don\u2019t have the exact number.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay. That\u2019s fine. And then going to the mortgage putbacks and so the Fannie settlement you got that done. It sounds like you\u2019re feeling better about the rep and warranty expense. I think I heard you saying, it might go from $300 million to $150 million per quarter. So I sense you\u2019re feeling better.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I\u2019m trying to reconcile that with what\u2019s taking place with the MBIA versus Countrywide court moves. And correct my thinking if anything is wrong here but I think it\u2019s an issue of Bank of America successor liability or is Bank of America responsible for Countrywide?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And as of January 9th and 10th, the oral arguments were completed, so I understand it\u2019s in the hands of Judge Bransten, the New York State Supreme Court? And the motion says that Bank of America is responsible for Countrywide and if so, I guess that could put the $8.5 billion private-label settlement at risk?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So, my question is, could that $8.5 billion settlement be at risk? Do I understand what\u2019s happening in the court correctly and what happens if the $8.5 billion private-label settlement does not go through?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Yeah. I think a couple of things on that, Mike. First, I think from our perspective, the $8.5 billion Gibbs &amp; Bruns settlement is going through the court process, would likely get wrapped up some time in the second quarter or early in the third quarter and that\u2019s completely independent from what\u2019s going on at MBIA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">With respect to MBIA in the broader monolines, as we\u2019ve said before generally, if you look at geography within the financial statements, the majority of the work that we do and where the monolines are accrued for at this point is within the litigation line item as opposed to within our provision for reps and warranties.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And the third thing I would say is that as it relates to kind of the general rep and warrant question. I think the most important thing to go back to is that, virtually -- the large majority of everything that was done with the GSEs at this point between our global settlement with Freddie and Countrywide, and our global settlement with both Countrywide and Bank of America with the GSEs just takes away a significant amount of risk relative to where we\u2019ve been before.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So we\u2019re really just talking private-label at this point?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">You\u2019ve got the, as I referenced, you\u2019ve got the several monolines that we\u2019re working through on a litigation prospective and then you\u2019re right, you\u2019ve got the private-label piece.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And I think, if you got back to the comments that we\u2019ve made about the geography, the representations and warranties, you can see we have a pretty sizable amount set aside to work through the private-label exposures.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">So what is the significance of the decision by Judge Bransten in the New York State Supreme Court? There was a Wall Street Journal article on January 11th, some other chatter saying that, if this motion goes against you and you\u2019re deemed responsible for the legal liabilities of Countrywide then that could be a negative event for you? Do you agree with that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">That, Mike, I mean, we could, I think, we think about this litigation goes back and forth, and the judge has a lot of decisions to make a lot of cases, and we\u2019ll play it out here, but we\u2019re comfortable our legal positions across the Board.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay. But for that, we should, you think we\u2019ll hear next month as opposed to in a mid-year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I\u2019m not sure the exact time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay. Just last question, next -- I don\u2019t -- I\u2019m just trying to -- how do we get arms around that risk? That\u2019s really my question? And so, if you wanted to just give advice to somebody, okay, here is the potential hit if things go wrong? What would be your answer to that or just, is there no answer?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I think what you -- what I would suggest you do on that, I\u2019m not going to quote somebody else\u2019s financial statements. But I think you can go look on MBIA\u2019s financial statements and see how much that they believe that we\u2019re owed and that they are owed from us, that\u2019s disclosed in their financial statement. So you can look at that and then the corollary is I think you have to keep in mind that there is a significant amount of money that they owe us within our Global Markets business that\u2019s very significant that we have marked it cents on the dollar.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Great. All right. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And we\u2019ll take a final question, this one from the site of Guy Moszkowski from Autonomous Research. Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">You guys have done a great job countering the net interest margin pressure obviously with managing your long-term debt down and maybe it\u2019s too early to think about this. But obviously under Orderly Liquidation Authority in Dodd-Frank, there is some provision for bailing debt and I was wondering, how you guys are thinking about that and how you might implement it over time?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I think the biggest thing Guy, that you have to go back to is that you have seen that the different reports that it\u2019s -- the people are looking at these amounts based on not only the amount of debt but also the amount of equity that you have on the balance sheet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">So if you go and look at our ratios, we obviously as far as the amount of pure common equity and other equity related instruments on the balance sheet now are more than virtually all of our peers and because of the way through the series of mergers that happened, our debt footprint on an absolute basis as well as on a relative basis is higher than our peers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">So as we look at this and as we talk about going forward, I think we still have a lot of work to do and opportunity to get our interest expense down through shrinking the size of the debt footprint and just bringing it down to where the rest of the industry is.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">So we can\u2019t predict with certainty where this goes but we know as we look at the different ratios and the different metrics, we still have some opportunity to continue to benefit the interest expense line, just to get to where our peers are from an overall debt and equity perspective.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay. That\u2019s fair. Just one last question regarding expenses, obviously, you\u2019ve stuck with your guidance on the new BAC and you\u2019ve told us where you are along the path of getting to those goals. And you\u2019ve updated us on the LAS expense reduction initiatives as well, but you\u2019re also talking about reinvesting and specifically around mortgage origination, but I think more broadly as well because obviously you don\u2019t want to ignore revenue growth opportunities. How do we reconcile those things and how much reinvestment at this point should we expect to see of the new BAC $8 billion and of the LAS $10 billion?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">On the LAS, I don\u2019t think you\u2019d see it. In the new BAC, it\u2019s net of the cost of achieving the results, which -- as well as your technology implementation cost and if you look at our technology development costs over the last few years, we\u2019ve gone from about to $2 billion and change to $3.6 billion per year. And the investments we\u2019re making in new BAC are investments in the franchise.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">In other words, to get the efficiencies we have re-embedded in there as the rework of our entire trading platform systems and things like that. So, we aren\u2019t investing to get the savings, but investing to also strengthen the franchise at the same time. So, it\u2019s all netted in there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay. So you would encourage analysts to continue to bring those entire amounts to the bottom line by 2015?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Yeah.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay. That\u2019s great. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And this concludes our Q&amp;A. I will go back to our presenters for any closing remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Thank you for your time and attention. Look forward to next quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And this will conclude today\u2019s program. Have a great day.

[Operator instructions.]  It\u2019s now my pleasure to introduce Kevin Stitt.  Please begin, sir.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Kevin Stitt</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning. Before Bruce Thompson and Brian Moynihan begin their comments, let me remind you that this presentation does contain some forward-looking statements regarding both our financial condition and financial results, and that these statements involve certain risks that may cause actual results in the future to be different from our current expectations.  And please see our press release and SEC documents for more reference.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">And with that, let me turn it over to Bruce.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thanks, Kevin, and good morning everyone.  I\u2019m going to start on slide four, as we work through the presentation.  We earned $0.20 per fully diluted share during the first quarter or $2.6 billion, up significantly from both the first and fourth quarter of last year.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">The one item we want to highlight up front, since it only happens once a year, is approximately $900 million of expense related to retirement eligible stock based compensation awards that we have had in the first quarter for the past several years.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We believe first quarter results demonstrate significant progress towards the goals we have discussed over the past several quarters.  Global markets client activity drove improved sales and trading results versus the fourth quarter of 2012, while investment banking performance remained strong.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Global wealth and investment management reported record earnings post the Merrill Lynch merger.  Expenses in most of our businesses continued to decline, although they are partially offset by higher revenue related incentive compensation and the impact of expense related to annual retirement eligible stock based compensation awards.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Capital and liquidity both continued to strengthen and are at record levels by most metrics.  The interest rate environment continues to be challenging, but moderate loan growth and reduced average long term debt helped stabilize net interest income versus the fourth quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Credit quality improved in almost all products, and both consumer and commercial loss rates were the lowest in several years.  And we continue to make strides in resolving legacy issues as we just recently reached an agreement to settle three class action lawsuits involving Countrywide-issued RMBS.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">On slide, if we look at the balance sheet, you can see the total balance sheet was down from both the fourth quarter of last year as well as the year ago period, although total loans are up slightly.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">If we look at commercial loans and leases, they\u2019re up 3% relative to the fourth quarter of 2012, and up 17% compared to the year ago period.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">If we move down to deposits, deposits were down slightly from the fourth quarter of \u201912 to the first quarter of \u201913, although up approximately $54 billion, or 5%, from the first quarter of 2012.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Tangible common equity ratio was up 20 basis points from the fourth quarter to 6.94%, and tangible book value was up about $0.10 to $13.46 at the end of the first quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">As you know, we started reporting under Basel I, incorporating the market risk final rule, this quarter.  The change added approximately $87 billion to risk-weighted assets.  As you can see on slide six at the end of March, our tier one common capital ratio under Basel I incorporating this change was approximately 10.6%, up from what we would have reported had we incorporated the change at the end of last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Under Basel III, on a fully phased in basis, tier one common capital was estimated to be $131 billion, or 9.4%, versus the fourth quarter estimated calculation of $129 billion and 9.25% respectively.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">I do want to bring to your attention that effective January 1 of this year, on a prospective basis, we adjusted the amount of capital being allocated to the business segments.  The adjustment reflects an enhancement to prior year methodology and now considers the effect of regulatory capital requirements in addition to our internal risk-based economic capital models.  On slide 22, and the appendix, we summarize the adjusted allocations for you.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">If we turn to slide seven, our global excess liquidity sources remain very strong at $372 billion.  Ending long term debt did increase $4.1 billion from the fourth quarter of \u201912 as we funded the January payment for the Fannie Mae settlement and opportunistically accelerated our 2013 issuance plans.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">While we issued $11.5 billion of vanilla parent company debt during the quarter, we still expect our long term debt to decline over the remainder of 2013 as well as during 2014.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Our parent company liquidity remains strong at $100 billion, and time to require funding was 30 months.  We\u2019d expect to continue to remain over two years of coverage.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">If you turn to slide eight, net interest income, our net interest income increased from $10.6 billion, or a net interest yield of 2.35% in the fourth quarter to $10.9 billion, or 2.43% in the first quarter of 2013.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">If we adjust these numbers for FAS 91, in hedging effectiveness, on the upper right hand chart, you can see that net interest income was effectively flat at $10.6 billion, or 2.37% during the first quarter of 2013.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">As we look at these results, we benefited obviously from the market related premium amortization expense.  In addition, we also benefited from higher commercial loan balances as well as the reduction in the average long term debt as well as the deposit rates paid.  Those benefits were partially offset by lower consumer loan balances and yields, as well as two fewer days during the period.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Let\u2019s move to slide nine and look at expenses.  Total expenses were down from both the first quarter a year ago and the fourth quarter as we delivered on expense reduction in LAS as well as ongoing cost savings in our other businesses from New BAC.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">LAS expenses, excluding litigation and the IFR acceleration agreement, were down approximately $500 million from the fourth quarter to $2.6 billion during the first quarter.  This decrease marks the first quarter, where the correlation between expenses and lower delinquent loan levels is visible.  Delinquent loan levels started to drop during the middle of last year, but as we have previously said, there is a lag of one to two quarters before you see the associated expenses decrease.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">LAS headcount for March was down approximately 3,000 from December, while headcount excluding LAS was down approximately 1,000.  As we\u2019ve said previously, we believe that LAS expenses, ex litigation, will be at $2.1 billion or lower in the fourth quarter of this year and with feel like the progress that we made during the first quarter in getting to that goal was quite strong.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Excluding LAS expenses, litigation, and annual retirement eligible cost, expenses in the quarter, in the red box on the slide, were $13.8 billion, an increase of $558 million from the fourth quarter of \u201912, and down $920 million or 6% from the first quarter a year ago.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">The increase from the fourth quarter was due to higher revenue related incentive compensation, approximately $800 million, which more than offset the impact of cost savings.  We continue to believe that we will achieve 75% of Project New BAC cost saves, or $1.5 billion per quarter, by the fourth quarter of this year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">The effective tax rate for the quarter was 28%, with nothing noteworthy to point out.  We would expect a slightly higher effective tax rate for the rest of the year, plus or minus any unusual items like another U.K. tax rate reduction.  This year\u2019s expected U.K. rate reduction of 3%, up from the previous assumption of 2%, should be enacted in the third quarter, and will result in a charge of approximately $1.2 billion to write down our U.K. DTA in that quarter.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">If we turn to slide 10, you can see that credit quality continues to improve.  Net chargeoffs declined 19% to $2.5 billion during the first quarter, which is the lowest level in several years.  The consumer loss rate dropped 34 basis points to 1.7%, the lowest since the beginning of 2008, while the commercial loss rate declined 5 basis points to 25 basis points, the lowest since 2006.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Provision expense of $1.7 billion includes a reserve reduction of approximately $800 million, reflecting the improved trends.  NPLs and reservable criticized balances also continued to decrease.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In addition, 28%, or $6.4 billion, of our NPAs are current consumer loans that were modified and are now current after a successful trial period or are loans classified as NPAs due to regulatory guidance that was issued in the second half of 2012.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Our allowance coverage to annualized chargeoffs increased from 1.96x in the fourth quarter of 2012 to 2.2x in the first quarter of 2013.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">If we turn to slide 11, we highlight the results of consumer business banking.  Starting this quarter, we\u2019ve combined business banking and deposits for reporting purposes.  Pretax earnings for consumer and business banking increased 4% versus the fourth quarter, driven by improved credit cost as well as lower expenses.  However, net income was relatively flat due to a higher tax rate.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Average deposit balances increased 4% or $18 billion compared to the fourth quarter, driven by $11 billion of organic growth and $7 billion related to transfers from global wealth and investment management.  As you know, we periodically move customers across business segments after an evaluation of how they can be best served by us.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Rates paid on deposits during the quarter declined 3 basis points due to pricing discipline and a mix shift in our deposits.  Brokerage assets increased $6.7 billion from the fourth quarter, or 9%, due to market appreciation and increased customer flows.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We reduced banking centers during the first quarter as we continue to optimize the delivery network.  Our mobile banking customer base reached 12.6 million, which is up 5% from the fourth quarter and 30% from a year ago.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Combined credit and debit card purchase volumes had a seasonal decline of 6% from the fourth quarter, but increased 3% from a year ago.  U.S. consumer credit card retail spend per average active account increased 7% from first quarter a year ago.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Average loans did decline $1.6 billion from the fourth quarter, due to seasonality and continued noncore portfolio runoff.  And as I mentioned earlier, credit quality continued to improve, with some of our credit quality indicators at historic lows.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">If we turn to slide 12, we address one of the two businesses within our consumer real estate services area, home loans.  As you know, the home loans business is responsible for [first lead] in home equity originations within consumer real estate services.  First mortgage retail originations of approximately $24 billion were up 11% from the fourth quarter and were up 57% compared with retail originations from a year ago.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We believe these increases are reflective of improvements in our retail market share.  Consequently, we are adding employees to improve our sales and fulfillment capacity, which is the driver behind higher expenses in home loans during the quarter.  However, given lower margins realized during the first quarter, core production income decreased from the fourth quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">If we turn to slide 13, legacy assets and servicing had a loss of $1.4 billion in the quarter, a significant improvement from the fourth quarter that was impacted by our settlements with Fannie Mae.  The provision for reps and warranties [unintelligible] was $250 million during the quarter.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">The MSR ended the quarter at $5.8 billion, up slightly from the end of the fourth quarter.  Although we announced the sale of mortgage servicing rights in January, the accounting sale will be recorded throughout the year, as the servicing asset is transferred.  MSR results, including hedges, were positive for the quarter.  The capitalized MSR rate ended the period at 61 basis points versus 55 basis points at the end of the year and 58 basis points a year ago.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Results did include approximately $700 million of litigation during the first quarter of \u201913, as well as a similar amount during the first quarter of 2012.  As you can see from our press release, this morning, as well as on slide 24 in the slide presentation, we did reach an agreement in principle to settle for $500 million three class action lawsuits involving Countrywide-issued RMBS.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We feel very good about resolving these exposures, which addressed original principal balance RMBS that exceeded $350 billion, or what we believe represents approximately 70% of the unpaid principal balance of all MBS, as to which securities disclosure claims have been filed or threatened as to all Bank of America related entities.   </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Servicing income decreased 17%, or $182 million, compared to the fourth quarter.  47% of this decrease was related to the legal sale of MSRs in connection with the sales that we announced in January, together with other, smaller MSR sales.   </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">The balance reflected payoffs that exceeded originations in the portfolio, due mainly to our exit from the correspondent channel in late 2011, combined with the seasonality and the timing of mortgage payments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">The number of loans in our servicing portfolio totaled approximately 6.5 million at the end of March, down 866,000 from the end of the year, due to actual transfers of approximately 570,000 and the rest due to payoffs.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">60-plus-day delinquent loans dropped from 773,000 units at the end of December to 667,000 units at the end of March, of which a third of the decrease is associated with transferred servicing.  We continue to believe that our 60-plus-day delinquent loans at the end of this year will be at 400,000 units or below.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">If we turn to slide 14, global wealth and investment management had a very strong quarter.  Earnings increased 25% to $720 million from the fourth quarter and continue to set post-merger records in several metrics.  The pretax margin of approximately 26% was impacted by low credit cost and a higher contribution from corporate ALM activities, some of which we would not expect to continue.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Overall, client activity in the wealth management business in the quarter was strong across all categories.  Client balances were up $82 billion, or 3.8%, from the fourth quarter, due to higher market levels and net positive flows offset somewhat by the net migration of deposits to consumer and business banking.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Period-end deposits dropped $26 billion, driven by $19 billion of net migration once again to consumer and business banking.  The rest of the decrease reflected year-end seasonality, heightened by the fiscal cliff and client investment activity, including long term assets under management activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Ending loan balances were at record levels, and long term AUM flows were a record $20 billion, the highest quarterly amount since the Merrill merger, and the 15th consecutive positive quarter.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Net income in global banking, slide 15, was $1.3 billion versus $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter, and down from the first quarter of last year, primarily due to higher provision expense, due to loan growth and asset quality stabilization.  Revenue increased 2% from the fourth quarter, reflecting increased business lending revenue.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Asset quality continues to improve.  Net chargeoffs declined $117 million, or 51%.  Reservable utilized criticized exposure declined 6%, and NPAs dropped 20% to $1.7 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On slide 16, you can see corporate-wide investment banking fees increased 26% from a year ago, but were down slightly from a record-setting fourth quarter in debt issuance.  Per [unintelligible], Bank of America Merrill Lynch gained market share compared to the fourth quarter of 2012, and based on our reported peer results, we believe, at $1.5 billion in investment banking fees during the first quarter of 2013, we were a very strong number two.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Average loans increased almost $12 billion from the fourth quarter, driven by growth in C&amp;I as well as within commercial real estate.  Ending loan balances continue to be higher than average balances, reflecting the momentum that we saw throughout the quarter.  Average deposit balances at $221 billion for the first quarter declined approximately $21 billion compared to the fourth quarter, partially impacted by the expiration of tax.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">If we switch to global markets, if you flip to slide 17, net income of $1.4 billion increased approximately $1 billion, excluding DVA, from the fourth quarter, reflecting increased sales and trading activity.  We did record DVA losses of $55 million in the first quarter of this year versus losses of $276 million in the fourth quarter and losses of $1.4 billion a year ago.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Total revenue ex DVA was up $1.9 billion, or 58%, from the fourth quarter, and was down 11% from the first quarter a year ago.  Sales and trading revenue, ex DVA, increased $1.9 billion from the fourth quarter, driven by our [fic] business, due to improved market sentiment.  [Fic] revenue ex DVA was up 85% from the fourth quarter due to improved customer activity across all product categories.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Versus a year ago, [Fic] revenue was down 20% ex DVA, as market making opportunities and credit products were reduced due to spread tightening being much more significant a year ago than what we experienced in the first quarter of this year.  Also contributing to the decline was a gain in credit products in the first quarter of last year that did not repeat and a decline in commodities revenue.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">In equities, excluding DVA, results increased 61% from the fourth quarter, due primarily to improved trading performance and increased volumes in cash markets driving higher commissions.  Versus a year ago, equity results were up 8% due to increased client financing balances.  Average VAR of $81 million in the quarter is down from $100 million in the fourth quarter and effectively flat with the year ago period.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On slide 18, we show you the results of all other, which to remind you includes our global principal investments business, the non-U.S. consumer card business, our discretionary portfolio associated with interest rate risk management, insurance, and the discontinued real estate portfolio as well as the international wealth management business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">The loss of $867 million was driven mainly by first quarter annual retirement eligible costs.  The $1.7 billion decline in net income versus the prior quarter was driven by the annual retirement eligible costs and the absence of tax benefit that were recognized in the fourth quarter of last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">With that, let me turn it over to Brian.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Brian Moynihan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Thanks, Bruce.  Before we take questions, I thought I\u2019d leave you with a few thoughts about the quarter.  As you can see on slide 19, we continue to work to stabilize the revenue streams and begin to build the strength to drive in the future.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">At the same time, we continue to work on the cost structure, both reducing costs and at the same time investing in the business.  As Bruce talked to you about, the 4,000 people we put to help drive our mortgage production and the 1,000 more loan officers are examples.  That in turn will help increase our profitability now and in the future.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We continue to see continued momentum and driving balance growth across all our customer groups.  When you look at the consumer side, this quarter we were pleased with the growth in deposits, the continued stabilization and profitability of the credit card business, and the ability to continue to drive the mortgage activity, the production activity, the way we want to, up 50% plus year over year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">As you can see in our global wealth management businesses, we have had a record level of assets under management come in from our industry leading business, and they had strong performance, including operating margins.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">As you think about the commercial lending business, you can see both year over year and linked quarter we\u2019ve had strong commercial loan growth as those businesses continue to produce strong profits for our company.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We remain strong in our investment banking revenues, as Bruce said, the number two positioning, and we continue to drive our positioning in that business.  If we look at our capital markets business, as you can see we continue to show good profitability and a strong increase from the fourth quarter, but we continue to maintain a low risk in the methodology which will run that business, driven toward the customers that we serve and making sure that we balance risk and reward at any turn.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We still have a lot of work ahead of us as a company.  We feel good about where we are and the progress we made this quarter.  We\u2019ll continue to drive the earnings forward to deliver the results that you expect of us and we expect of ourselves.  So let\u2019s open it up for Q&amp;A.  </p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p6\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">[Operator instructions.]  We\u2019ll first go to the line of Glenn Schorr from Nomura.  Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Good loan growth in the C&amp;I and commercial real estate side.  Just curious, what kinds of yields are being brought on?  And from what I understand, there\u2019s pretty reasonable competition for those new loans, so just curious on how you balance the growth and margin compression in the markets?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">It\u2019s interesting, if we look at the commercial loan balances across the platform, the spread on the new originations was actually up slightly relative to both the fourth quarter of last year as well as relative to the first quarter of last year.  And it\u2019s interesting in that the loans that came on, not only were the spreads wider, but based on our internal risk ratings, the credit quality of what was being brought on was also stronger.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So we feel like the loans that we\u2019re bringing on we\u2019re doing in a prudent way.  And you can see that as you look in the supplements that a decent chunk of the loans that are being brought on are international.  Not any real concentrations, but both international, domestic, and really across all products.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">I wanted to get your thoughts on the expenses, on slide nine.  I wanted to make sure that I understood.  Should the starting point, being that the retirement eligible is a first quarter phenomenon, is the starting point the 18.12, less the 900 or so, as we think about second quarter and then folding in the New BAC incremental efficiencies?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Yes.  I think, Glenn, that\u2019s exactly right.  That 18.2 included the 900 from the retirement eligible employees that only happens once a year.  So you\u2019re right, as you go to the second quarter, the starting point should be 17.3 million.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">There would be two other things that I would point out once again, that if you look at the compensation expense in the first quarter relative to the last couple of quarters of last year, it was elevated by about $800 million based on the revenues that we saw within the sales and trading, the global banking, and to a lesser extent the wealth management business.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So we hope those repeat, but I would just highlight that that\u2019s a delta relative to the last several quarters of last year.  And then obviously from that starting point we would look to continue to drive down expenses based on the work that we\u2019ve spoken about with New BAC that we would expect to achieve throughout the year.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And you also mentioned your long term debt is down $75 billion year on year, and you expect more maturities in \u201913 and \u201914, in the 20s.  I guess that\u2019s perfectly straightforward.  Does that include any adjustments for what\u2019s coming down the pipe with OLA, or do you have to just take a wait and see attitude on what those rules are?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">We obviously are paying close attention to the different OLA proposals.  I think if you look at the mix between the Merrill debt as well as the BAC debt, and you compare those dollar amounts relative to risk weighted assets, and you compare us relative to our peers, at least all of the work that we\u2019ve done suggests that we\u2019re at the very high end of the amount of debt and related instruments that we have relative to risk-weighted assets.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So the rules obviously are not clear at this point.  We feel like we\u2019re positioned very well based on what we understand the different proposals are that are out there, realizing it still is moving around.  So as we go throughout the year, we would expect, as I said, to continue to drive that footprint down, not only in 2013 but throughout 2014, and we continue to be very focused on that.   </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Brian Moynihan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">I\u2019d add that there\u2019s also a rationalization of the footprint.  Remember this was put on by various companies, not by one company, that we\u2019ve been restructuring.  So even if there\u2019s an amount outstanding, the cost could come down, because you can string it out.  The rates paid are fairly high, because they\u2019re different environments than we\u2019ve been in, and expect to be in in the next couple of years.  So there\u2019s even value, even if you said the [notional] wouldn\u2019t move as far, based on some interpretation of the rules, to get debt footprint more rational and more spread across time than it is today.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">We\u2019ll go next to the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank.  Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank   </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Just to follow up a little bit on the fixed income trading results.  Obviously it can be lumpy quarter to quarter, but it was down a little bit more than we saw elsewhere.  You talked about some of the mortgage areas.  Was there a particular gain last year that was unusual?  Or it just activity?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">We referenced three things.  The first was, there was a gain, that, as you look at that decline, that was in the area of $250 million that I would categorize more quite frankly as a recovery than a gain, that we had highlighted during the quarter last year.  So a decent chunk of that was a gain that did not recur.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Then I think it\u2019s important, if you go and look at, during the quarter, we saw the financial spreads, which tend to be a fairly significant part of any [fic] trading business, tighten significantly in the first quarter of last year, and during the first quarter of this year start to finish, actually widen.  So that was the second piece of it.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And then the third piece we referenced is that commodities had a particularly strong quarter last year and did not have as strong a quarter this year.  So those three general things I would say.  Flows generally continue to be very strong, and as you look at where we were relative to the fourth quarter last year, I actually think we continue to make good progress.  But it was a little lumpy in the first quarter of last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Brian Moynihan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And I\u2019d add that as you think about how we\u2019re running the global markets business, if you look at our VAR and our risk taking, we\u2019re keeping a balance relative to the rest of the company.  And so there will be times when people do better than we are, and there will be times we\u2019ll do better than them.  But we\u2019re keeping it balanced. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">The second thing that Tom [Montag] and his team worked on is the expense side.  So you can see the operating leverage when you look across the first quarter of last year to this year, and importantly the fourth quarter of last year to this year.  You can see that with a little bit of revenue, you generate a lot more profit.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And so the idea is we\u2019re keeping this business so that we can make some money on a $3 billion trading revenue level in the aggregate in the business and a lot of money at a $5 billion level, and you\u2019re seeing that play out.  So if you think about it, we made money on every trading day of the quarter.  The VAR was down.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And so I think we should be careful to think that we may not [roar] as much as other people might, because this is one of the many businesses that we have, and we drive it for the benefit of the investing customers, and also the issuing customers.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And then just separately, in terms of your capital actions, I think many were positively surprised by the CCAR Fed approval for buybacks in both common and preferred.  Just any commentary in terms of the pace of the common share repurchase and on the preferred side?  The timing of that?  And do you have to issue any to replace what you\u2019re calling?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Two things on that.  The first is you probably saw, I believe on April 1, we actually went ahead and issued the redemption notices for the $5.5 billion of preferreds that are outstanding.  Just under $500 million of preferred dividend savings that we\u2019ll have on that.  And there was no requirement to issue to replace that, so as you look at that redemption, that\u2019s a good redemption, where you can look at those savings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">As it relates to the common, we\u2019d expect to be balanced and work through the share repurchase throughout the year, and really don\u2019t have much more to comment on no.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">We\u2019ll move next to the line of Chris Mustascio with KBW.  Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Chris Mustascio - KBW  </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Bruce, a quick question.  We\u2019ve gone through expenses in terms of the stock compensation in the quarter and also higher first quarter compensation related to revenues.  And you can kind of back that out and see what the run rate is for the second quarter.  But you also mentioned that you expect to achieve $1.5 billion in call saves per quarter by fourth quarter of 2013, related to Project New BAC.  How do I account for that third piece of the pie?  I know the stock compensation in the quarter.  I know the overall compensation being high because of revenues.  How do I account for New BAC into a run rate up second quarter?  </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">We\u2019ve said that at the end of 2012, on a quarterly basis, we had achieved $900 million per quarter of New BAC cost saves in the fourth quarter of 2012.  So as you look to adjust your models, we will take that $900 million a quarter that we would have had in the fourth quarter and that will grow to $1.5 billion by the fourth quarter of 2013.  Some of that we achieved during the first quarter, and we\u2019d expect to achieve that throughout the year.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And then the second piece, outside of the more one-timers that we talked about in the first quarter were the LAS expenses, where we\u2019ve said we\u2019ll get that number below $2.1 billion by the end of 2013.  And we obviously got that from $3.1 billion in the fourth quarter down to $2.6 billion.  So in addition to those compensation related items, we\u2019ve got those two levers to continue to drive expenses down during the balance of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Chris Mustascio - KBW </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And just to be clear, the $1.5 billion in New BAC by fourth quarter 2013, what are the cost saves running in this quarter on New BAC?  The delta I can kind of gauge.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">We\u2019ve not given an exact number.  I think what you should do is if you go back to slide nine and look at the red bar, we\u2019ve said that there was 800 of increased incentives in that 13.8.  That gets the number down to 13.  You should assume that\u2019s part of the benefit between 13.3 and 13 related to New BAC, but we\u2019ve not given an exact number.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And we\u2019ll go next to the line of Meredith Whitney with Meredith Whitney Advisory Group.  Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Meredith Whitney - Meredith Whitney Advisory Group</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I just wanted some commentary on sequencing of litigation reserves and what\u2019s already been factored in in terms of the bulk of litigation settlements, and then what\u2019s on the horizon?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Brian Moynihan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I\u2019m going to walk through the different pieces, and as it relates to overall litigation as well as the rep and warrant.  And I\u2019d ask you to flip back to slide 23, where we lay this out.  I think one of the things that we feel very good about the progress during the quarter is if you walk through what we\u2019ve laid out on the bottom of page 23, if we start with the reps and warrants, between the settlements at the beginning of 2011 as well as the Fannie settlement that we had at year-end, you can see that as we lay out here, we\u2019re generally through the GSE exposure as it relates to rep and warrant.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">You then go down to the monolines.  There are three significant monolines that we did business with, five in total.  We obviously have had previous settlements with two of those three monolines.  The one that obviously gets a lot of press is MBIA, that continues to be out there.  You then go down into the private label rep and warrant, and obviously the most significant piece of that is the Gibbs &amp; Bruns settlement, that continues to work through the court process and we would expect the outcome of that to be during the third quarter of this year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So as you look at reps and warrants, we\u2019re through a significant portion of that.  If you then flip to the securities litigation, which is the other significant piece of the litigation expense, one of the reasons that we think the settlement that we announced today was significant is as I referenced, if we look at the original unpaid balance company wide, of all of the securities that were underwritten, this settlement today relates to, companywide, about 70% of that.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s going to ever, at this point, declare complete victory.  We do think that between the Fannie and related settlements and the look back in the fourth quarter as well as the settlement that we\u2019ve announced today, that we\u2019re moving through in a pretty meaningful way this pipeline of items.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">We\u2019ll move next to the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.  Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Bruce, just following up on that, you have on that same page the range of possible loss above additional accruals of up to $4 billion.  There was some concern that some of the recent legal decisions in the monoline cases, particularly around the causation issue, might have impacted your estimates there.  It doesn\u2019t look like it did.  Can you tell us why that hasn\u2019t changed any of your outlook on that RPL number?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Once again, the RPL that we have within the rep and warrant will continue to be up to $4 billion.  As we\u2019ve said before, at this point, given we don\u2019t have repurchase history with the monolines, the monolines are covered within our litigation reserves.  And we have both litigation reserves as well as range of possible loss for litigation.  And you should assume that there was some additional monies during the quarter in litigation expense that was set aside for the monolines.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And then you noted that the settlement that you announced today covers 70% of issuances on which claims have been made.  Is that what you said?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">That\u2019s correct.  Claims or threatened claims.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"> </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So where does that leave some of the higher-profile government suits, like FHFA and some of the things that we know about?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">The two most significant that are out there on the securities litigation that have been more public would be [FAFA] as well as AIG.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And on the Gibbs &amp; Bruns, the final hearing is in late May.  I guess deliberations could extend for a few months after that.  Do you hope to get the final resolution in the third quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">That\u2019s our best sense.  Far be it from us to forecast that process, but our best estimate would be the third quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And then switching gears, on the net interest income, do you expect to maybe do better than the core $10.6 billion now that you have a little bit of loan growth, and then day count, or do you expect to kind of stay around that level?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I think at this point, where we\u2019ve guided is we\u2019ve said that with the work that we\u2019ve done that ex any market related impacts that $10.5 billion is a good starting point.  That number can bounce around, but I would continue to look at that $10.5 billion in the near term as the right starting point.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And how about on credit costs?  You had a nice move down this quarter.  Do you still have the capacity to take the reserves down further and do you expect the provision to make further progress below the $1.7 billion that you did this quarter?  <strong> </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">It\u2019s a good question.  I think as we look at the chargeoffs and the move in chargeoffs, to have almost a 20% decline in chargeoffs I think speaks to the quality of the portfolio, and the work that we had said had been done back in late \u201908 and early \u201909 as it relates to consumer underwriting.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We previously said that as we look at provision, chargeoffs will come down about the time that the releases also come down to get you to a level between 1.8 and 2.2.  If you look at what we experienced this quarter, and with what we\u2019re seeing with the trends, it clearly feels like we\u2019ll be at the low end of that going forward.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">This quarter you were below the range, right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So are we setting a new range?  Or do you still think we should think about that range of 1.8 to 2.2?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I would think about it at the bottom of the range at this point.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Brian Moynihan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">It\u2019s clear it\u2019s all about the home finance side now.  You see the credit card business continue to make some incremental improvement.  It\u2019s made a dramatic improvement from the high points going back several quarters.  But it\u2019s really about mortgages and everything you hear about in the market that we\u2019re witnessing in our portfolios in terms of house price improvement.  Activity levels will bear well on that as we look forward, obviously.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">One more thing on the revenue side.  The mortgage servicing revenues seemed to take a step down from the MSR sale.  What should the cadence of that be going forward?  Is part of the decline kind of built in from the phased in sale?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I think what we said is that roughly $90-100 million of the decline in servicing revenue was a result of the sales.  We\u2019ve said that as we get to the end of the year, the sales will ultimately lead to a reduction in revenues of about $200 million related to the MSR sales.  We obviously had a fair bit of that given that a decent chunk of the performing sales had an effective close date on January 31.  So we\u2019ve clearly taken a piece of that, and there\u2019s probably another $100 million a quarter to come relating to those sales by the end of this year.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We tend not to just look at the revenue number, but we look at the contribution from a pretax perspective, and obviously as you see from the work that we\u2019re doing within legacy assets and servicing we continue to think that the opportunities there are significant.  <strong> </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And how do you guys think about the ultimate target FMSR size and maintaining a balance between origination and servicing in the mortgage business for when rates eventually rise?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">At this point the MSR balance was roughly $5.8 billion at the end of the first quarter.  If we were to pro forma those sales throughout the year, assuming rates stay where they are, it gets you down to about a $5 billion number.  From an overall capital perspective, plus or minus, that feels about right.  Obviously any change from that\u2019s going to be a function of the opportunities to originate things that make sense versus any type of accelerated prepayments that may or may not happen.  But I think $5 billion from an MSR balance perspective is not a bad number to be looking at.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Brian Moynihan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">From the origination side, the first order of business after we got out of the correspondent business was to kind of get the business on an upward trajectory.  And if you go back and look, starting in the fourth quarter of \u201911, we\u2019ve basically grown retail originations quarter after quarter after quarter, and this quarter again we had another 15% off the fourth quarter last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">But if you actually look at the headcounts, remember, we\u2019ve got a thousand plus loan officers working this quarter that weren\u2019t here last year.  They\u2019re training and getting up to speed, so the next order of business is how to overcome the HARP refinancing levels which we have in the portfolio and sort of get to a core run rate.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">But there\u2019s no cap on us in terms of retail originations.  We\u2019ll do as much as we can do for our clients.  And you\u2019ve seen us drive it forward every quarter, and now we have more people, more training, we\u2019re up to speed.  4,000 more people in the fulfillment area.  And we don\u2019t see the pipeline slowing down.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">We\u2019ll move next to the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.  Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">In wealth management, just hoping to dig in.  You guys highlighted a couple of things that helped.  The margins have been higher, which it seems you don\u2019t think are going to repeat.  About how much of a tailwind were those items?  And if we were looking ex, it seems as though maybe we might have an updraft anyway, because we were looking at like a 500 basis point increase year over year and quarter over quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">We talked about credit costs.  I think within the business there was roughly a $30 million reserve release during the quarter that we wouldn\u2019t assume is necessary going to continue.  But I think if you look at overall pretax margin, we\u2019ve been kind of in the 20-21% area.  This quarter was 26%.  I think the assumption going forward is that we\u2019ll clearly be north of the 21%, but I wouldn\u2019t expect that in the near term we run at 26% either.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I think you also highlighted the ALM as a tailwind too.  Is there any way to quantify that?  And can you help me understand the mechanics of how ALM will run through GWIM.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I think the easiest way to look at it is if you look at deltas we had some of the market-based benefits that we quoted that were roughly $300 million during the quarter.  A portion of that gets allocated to GWIM and if you look at the GWIM business, you can see that the net interest income was up about $100 million.  So I\u2019ll give you those pieces of data, but we\u2019re not going to quote exact numbers as to how we allocate that out.  But it\u2019s a piece of that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">On the NPAs, I guess you guys had said that 20% from mods or regulatory requirements, and we\u2019ve run through the regulatory requirements before.  Just hoping to understand on the mods, it was my understanding that after about six months of payments, the [TDRs] are reclassified such current.  Do you guys account for TDRs differently than that?  Or can you help me understand how that works?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">You\u2019re exactly right.  Once a borrower goes through the trial mod period and gets to a permanent mod, they need to be current for six months before we would look to bring those back in.  And when you consider that number, realize that coming out of the national mortgage settlement there was heightened modification activity during the third and fourth quarters, in particular, of last year.  So we clearly would expect some of those to cross the six month period during the second quarter.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And if you go back to I believe it was the third quarter, when we adopted the regulatory guidance, the biggest of that $6-plus billion, north of $4 billion of that is the regulatory guidance that was given.  So that\u2019s going to be the bigger piece of the two things.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">We\u2019ll move next to the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.  Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">A couple of questions, one on mortgage.  You indicated in the past that you were interested in increasing the mortgage origination share, and you\u2019ve done that.  I\u2019m just wondering how close you are to where you want to be, or are you still in the process of building out what capacity you want to have there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brian Moynihan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">On the page you can see that the mortgage loan officers are up about a thousand year over year.  We are still adding as we speak.  The success of putting them into the branch environments where you have a mortgage loan officer, an FSA, personal bankers, is multiples of the success in other branch environments.  And so we\u2019re just driving that.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So the pipeline is still as strong as it\u2019s ever been.  We added thousands of people to get them closed on time, and we\u2019re still working our tail off to get mortgage loans closed on time.  I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any cap on where this could go.  We still have tremendous opportunity within our client base that are unserved, that our clients go elsewhere to get their mortgages.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So you\u2019ve seen it drive up 50% plus year over year, another $3 billion increase in quarterly production fourth quarter to first quarter.  So I challenged the team, they\u2019ve got to outrun the HARP at some point, because that will die off, although it\u2019s been extended.  But I wouldn\u2019t tell you there\u2019s any sort of cap.  I think we should be able to drive it up to more of our natural share in things like deposits and stuff, which is more than 10% over time.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So go from 4% a couple of quarters ago up to 10-12%?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yeah, but this could take time.  I mean, we\u2019ve been about a 0.2% increase in market share each quarter, so this is a lot of activity.  But $24 billion of retail production, and we\u2019re in the the top two or three, and our view is we ought to be able to push that forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And so two follow ups on that.  One is on HARP, how much of the production right now is HARP, and how much HARP is in your footprint, your client base, that you haven\u2019t done yet?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">If we look at both combined MHA and HARP, that\u2019s just under 50% of the total for the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And what\u2019s left in your client base to do that you haven\u2019t done yet?  How many more quarters of this do you think you have?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I would say generally there was more of it this quarter than we probably would have thought coming into the year.  And we\u2019re hesitant to give an exact number, but as Brian referenced, I would say overall pipeline in activity, as we went through the first quarter, continued to be very strong.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brian Moynihan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I expect that component, though, is probably at a strong point right now, and will come down over the next three or four quarters, just because frankly, some of that opportunity goes away.  That was part of the transaction value that we got.  But key is if you look at the non-HARP production, making homes affordable production, you\u2019re seeing that grow at a faster rate.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And you\u2019re just HARPing your current portfolio set?  You\u2019re not going after other people\u2019s?  You have enough to do with your own portfolio?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Brian Moynihan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">We\u2019ve got enough to do with our own portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And then just separately, on page 6 you go through the regulatory capital.  Can you just remind us what your expectation is for RWAs going forward, passive mitigation, active mitigation?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I\u2019d say generally throughout the quarter with some of the growth that we\u2019ve seen, and I assume you\u2019re referring to Basel III?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">As we go through over the next couple of quarters, we\u2019d just say what we continue to say, which is that with where we are from the DTA perspective is we go forward pretax, should be the way that generally we\u2019re creating capital.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And I think as it relates to different mitigation opportunities, the biggest thing that we see out there is that as home prices continue to move up, and we continue to see the home equity portfolio amortize, which has been about $3.5 billion a quarter, that there\u2019s a fairly significant tailwind as it relates to reductions in risk-weighted assets there.  As we go forward, the runoff of the structured credit portfolio that we have we would expect to accelerate as we go into \u201914, \u201915, and \u201916.  And that will obviously be gone by the end of \u201917.  So that\u2019s an opportunity.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And then the third thing I would say is that we continue to work through, and you can see we made progress on the private equity portfolio this quarter, and we\u2019ll continue to wrap that up.  So the biggest item as we go forward is just going to be the pretax income line.  But I do think that there will continue to be other opportunities to drive that as well.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And the runoff of the structured credit, how much is that right now?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">We\u2019ve not given an exact number that we would expect that to run off, but you should assume it\u2019s north of $20 billion of risk-weighted assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Today, in Q1?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">That\u2019s correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And then the last question is on how you get to the $5 billion ask that you had for CCAR that got approved.  Because with the 9.4% common tier one ratio in Q3 and these RWA mitigation opportunities coming going forward, clearly you must know going into it that you were going to be well above the 8.5 FSC minimum that\u2019s out there, and that you\u2019d be approaching 10%, that kind of high end of the range scenario that people in businesses like yourselves have targeted.  So just wondering how you got to $5 billion and how we think about capital ask going forward?   </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I think there are three different metrics and ways that you get to looking at capital allocation and capital return.  The first is obviously where your ratios are after stress, through the CCAR process.  And as you look at the results that we had, we ended up just above 6% after our ask, which relative to our peers positioned us well.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">The second item, which as you referenced, you moved to Basel III, and we feel like we\u2019ve done a very good job on Basel III, and to your point, are above the minimums, above buffers, and feel like we\u2019ve done a good job there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And then the third, which is what you\u2019ve heard us talking a lot about, is just driving the core earnings as the third component.  And so we\u2019ve balanced all of those three.  And I guess the other thing I\u2019d say is if you look at the ask, obviously we\u2019ve got $5 billion that will get returned to the shareholders based on our plans, but I don\u2019t think you should also minimize the other $5.5 billion that will go to redeem preferred stock, because that preferred stock had coupons between 8 and 8 5/8 percent.  It\u2019s not tax deductible, and we\u2019re not replacing it with other preferred stock.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And we\u2019ll move next to the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research, LLC.  Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Nancy Bush - NAB Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">A couple of question for you on retail.  You\u2019ve closed, I think, 262 branches, if I\u2019m looking at the numbers correctly, over the past year.  Can you tell me how that number looks for the coming year, and if there is some \u201coptimal\u201d number of branches that you want to maintain?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Brian Moynihan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I think we were clear a few quarters ago when we said we\u2019d do the 750, and I think you can see that number is close to 5,000.  So think about that as 5400-odd getting down to 5,000.  The point was at the time we did an optimization thought process, looked at it with the customer behavior and got that number, and we\u2019re busily doing that in a very thoughtful way so that we retain a lot of the customers, especially on the consolidation side.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And then also, obviously, as you know, we have exited some of the markets and sold community banks where they can get the leverage in the operations that we can\u2019t get in some of those markets.  So the question of what happens next, I think, is probably a question we take up as we get into \u201914 and think about what the customer behavior change has been.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Because we\u2019re seeing a fairly strong change in the behavior of the customers, evidenced by the mobile volumes.  And so not only do we have a number of mobile customers, it goes up about 10,000 a day, and it\u2019s 12.6, it\u2019s also what they do.  So 100,000 checks a day get deposited by people taking pictures of them.  And so that behavioral change we\u2019ve got to keep monitoring.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">At the same time, we\u2019re building the centers to be these more destination, with the FSAs, which are brokers in the branch, the mortgage loan officers.  And so that configuration I think we\u2019re still testing, so I don\u2019t know the exact answer, but because the near term is to get the other 400 change that we\u2019re talking about through.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">If you step back from it and look year over year, the branches are down, the customer satisfaction is up, and the deposits are up strongly, which is a nice combination.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Nancy Bush - NAB Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So what I hear you saying is that as you go into 2014, this 5,000 branch number is not written in stone, is that correct?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Brian Moynihan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Think of us as a retail looking at what the best way to get the most out of the market and serve our customers the best.  And that will always be a subject we\u2019ll talk about.  And we\u2019re making massive investments in our ATM architecture, virtual ATMs, and the mobile space to make sure that we\u2019re right with our customers.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Nancy Bush - NAB Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And my second part to the question would be addressing all these changes in consumer behavior, etc.  Has part of this program also been to address some of the service issues that you guys had encountered over the past few years, as other stuff took more attention?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Brian Moynihan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Absolutely, and part of it is continuing to upgrade the systems.  So if you look at our company between 2009 and 2015, we\u2019ll have rewritten all the systems, and we\u2019ll bring systems which were more standalone product systems into systems which are consistent with a customer approach.  So the kinds of inquiries you get where we can see a person wants us to not [unintelligible], and those are going away.  Frankly, getting out of the multiple deposit systems helps.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And so our complaints are down a lot.  Our attrition is way down.  And so we\u2019re seeing the benefits of this as we go through it.  But absolutely this is all geared at maintaining the customer satisfaction posture, which is up year over year, and driving it to places we haven\u2019t driven before, honestly, based on all the tools we have.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Nancy Bush - NAB Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Bruce, the stock is down roughly about 3% in the market right now, and there was some disappointment with the headline number.  But all the ingredients of the quarter look pretty good.  Was it your sense that the the $900 million in seasonal costs was built into most estimates?  Or was this a point of variance do you think?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I think they are probably two things.  I think the $900 built into the estimates, which we have every period as we look out there, I think it was in some, not in others.  So I don\u2019t think there was uniformity on that?  And then I think the other item that was out there as we look at a lot of the analysts they look at core, they don\u2019t include any litigation number, and obviously there was a $900 million litigation number.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">We obviously need that to come down, but what I mentioned to Meredith\u2019s question, I think getting this class action and shrinking the tail risk with respect to our mortgage backed security litigation tail risk was a significant item for us, and we were able to get through that this quarter being generally in line with what you all had expected.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">We\u2019ll go next to the line of Eric Wasserstrom with SunTrust Robinson.  Your line is open.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I just want to circle back to the litigation issues for a moment.  Could you just help me understand what precisely, at the upcoming hearing on the 30th, is being debated?  Is it simply the amount of the settlement?  Or is it more the actual legitimacy of the process by which the settlement was derived?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">It\u2019s hard for us to predict what\u2019s going to happen on the 30th.  We\u2019re obviously not a part of this.  This is Bank of New York Mellon, in their capacity as trustee.  And obviously the standard and what needs to be worked through is did they go through, and were they prudent, and did they follow a process to getting to the point to say that this settlement made sense for investors.  And so that will be the general topic.  We\u2019re not going to predict what exactly happens on the 30th.  Besides, we obviously wouldn\u2019t have entered into the settlement if we didn\u2019t think that there was a basis for it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And I\u2019m certainly not asking you to anticipate an outcome, I just want to make sure it\u2019s not as narrow as the monetary settlement.  It\u2019s the broader issue of whether [Boney] followed the appropriate procedures in terms of determining a settlement.  Is that correct?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">That\u2019s correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">We\u2019ll go next to the line of David Hilder with Drexel Hamilton.  Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>David Hilder - Drexel Hamilton </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Just another litigation question.  Is it fair to assume that the Countrywide RMBS that were included in the settlement that you announced this morning are all included in the securities that were the subject of the settlement of the Gibbs &amp; Bruns and Bank of New York as trustee process?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">There is clearly a significant overlap.  The people that were part of the settlement today tended to be people that would have been original purchasers of the securities.  With respect to Gibbs &amp; Bruns, they could have either been original purchasers or subsequent purchasers, but there is overlap.  And as we\u2019ve said in the release, that the people that were part of the settlement today, to the extent that Gibbs &amp; Bruns gets approved, they will receive whatever they would have otherwise received as part of Gibbs &amp; Bruns.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>David Hilder - Drexel Hamilton </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">But looked at from the perspective of the Countrywide securities issues, would all of the ones in today\u2019s settlement be included in the Bank of New York as trustee settlement?  </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yes, because as we said in the release, this covers 80% of the Countrywide securities, of which Gibbs &amp; Bruns was obviously a very significant piece.  So you\u2019re absolutely correct in that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>David Hilder - Drexel Hamilton </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And then I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything you can say on this, but any prospective statement about the settlement or possible timing of resolution for the various alphabet soup of remaining litigation MBIA, FHFA, and AIG?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">No, there\u2019s really nothing that we would say there.  I think I would just reiterate, though, that as you look at the component of what we settled today from a securities litigation perspective, as it relates to current outstanding amount as well as what was originally underwritten, it\u2019s obviously a significant piece of that.  We continue to want to resolve and get these legacy issues put behind us.  At the same time, between the capital that we\u2019ve built, and the number of them that we\u2019ve put behind us, it has to make sense for the shareholders.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">We\u2019ll go next to the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.  Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Just like on the trusts that were outside of the Bank of New York, you did provide, on a similar basis.  Is there anything you could say about the other lawsuits as to whether there\u2019s a provision that\u2019s been in there for them, based upon some of the experience in the other cases?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Brian Moynihan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re talking about.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">You\u2019ve had experience with some of the monolines.  I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s like a facts and circumstances, when you think about MBIA.  How do you think about whether there\u2019s been a provision there?  And the same thing for the FHFA lawsuits?  Are there elements of some of the others that cause you to have had some degree of provisioning for them?  Or would that only happen once those get advanced?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Brian Moynihan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">They\u2019re all in litigation reserves, which are not on that page.  Those are just the rep and warranty reserves.  The monolines, the [FHFA], and those are in litigation reserves, because the [FHFA] and AIG are RMBS cases.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Right, but the question is, should we think about there having been a component of them, or is that all going to be pending?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Brian Moynihan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I want to make sure I understand the question.  As you go through the litigation reserves, we have reserves for those litigation items that we have the basis to reserve.  To the extent that we don\u2019t have the basis to reserve, we have a range of possible loss.  So as it relates to these items, those are the two ways that we work through the reserves.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And the litigation reserves, as we\u2019ve said before, are where we house reserves for litigation matters, as well as, as I said, the monolines reside within that litigation bucket as well, because we\u2019re in litigation with them.  And then obviously, as you move to the rep and warrant reserve, we\u2019ve got the actual reserves, and then we\u2019ve also disclosed the range of possible loss for those items that we don\u2019t have the basis to reserve.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay, thanks.  I\u2019ll take that offline.  Just a second question, with respect to the mortgage business and the gain on sale, the primary secondary spread did end the quarter lower than where it was on average.  Talk a little bit about how you see that gain on sale trending into Q2 and as we go forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I would say that if we look at where we ended the quarter relative to where we started, I would say that it feels at this point that the spreads have somewhat settled out.  But obviously those spreads are going to be a function of activity versus capacity, and we\u2019ll have to see how that unfolds over the quarter.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">We\u2019ve obviously built up, and as Brian referenced, the capacity to do what we need to do for our customers.  And we\u2019ll just need to see where those margins go throughout the quarter.  But at this point, there was obviously a step down in margins during the first quarter.  It feels to some extent as if that\u2019s leveled out, but we\u2019ll have to see how it plays out over the second quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">We\u2019ll go next to the line of Matthew Burnell with Wells Fargo.  Your line is open.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Just a quick question in terms of the deposit costs.  You\u2019ve got your domestic deposit costs down to sub-20 basis points.  You\u2019ve got similar higher costs outside the U.S., although obviously much smaller balances.  How are you thinking about being able to reduce the non-U.S. deposit costs, particularly the time deposit categories, over the next six to 12 months.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">You\u2019re right, the international component is obviously a very small component.  Those are large.  They\u2019re almost exclusively either wholesale deposits that are out there.  I\u2019m not sure you\u2019re going to see much more movement in that.  I think to your earlier question the majority of the costs of the deposits are those housed in the U.S., and you can see that as we build up the core deposits, the amount of time deposits that we have here in the U.S. we would expect those to continue to come down.  And as those come down, all other things being equal, you\u2019d expect the cost of domestic deposits continue to move down.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And a bigger picture question on OLA.  You\u2019ve got about $134 billion of long term debt at Bank of America Corporation as of the end of the year, an additional $90 billion of Merrill Lynch debt.  When you\u2019re thinking about OLA, do you think about potentially explicitly agreeing to support the Merrill Lynch debt?  Does that help you at all under OLA?  Or are you planning on just maintaining the status quo on that basis?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I think as I said before, the OLA rules continue to evolve.  If you look out at our annual filings that we\u2019ve put out there, we\u2019ve said that we\u2019re looking at does it make sense to have ML and Co merged into BAC.  That\u2019s ongoing work that continues.  We believe ultimately, as the Merrill debt runs off, and to the extent there\u2019s reissuance, it\u2019s at the Bank of America level.  So we pick up that benefit.  And like I said, as we look at any ratio, and as we consider the different rules, it feels like we\u2019ll have more than enough in total parent company debt relative to risk-weighted assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And then just one final question.  You mentioned the time to require funding has come down a little bit from the end of last year.  And you intend on maintaining that above two years.  Should we think about that coming down closer to 24 months over the next six to 12 months?  Or is it too early to tell?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">When you mentioned it came down in the quarter, realize that one of the reasons why it came down is that we\u2019ve included the $5.5 billion of preferred redemptions in the time to require funding.  That largely drove that.  But to your question, it\u2019s a good one.  We would expect over time that the amount of parent company liquidity that we have would tend to come down over time.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">As we get through the \u201913 and \u201914 maturities, we still believe we can bring the parent company liquidity down, bring the cost of it down, and you\u2019re right, we will keep time to required funding at at least two years.  Initially, given we work through maturities, that will stay elevated in the high 20s, 30.  But the goal is to obviously flatten out the maturities and have that become more in the two-year area, which is consistent with what we\u2019ve been saying for some time.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">We\u2019ll go next to the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.  Your line is open.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I had a question on the litigation, but before we go there, there\u2019s an article saying that Brian you are leading a revenue push at the company.  And I was wondering if this is a tweak, a strategic change, and as far as revenue push, starting from the top, is that because of what Bank of America is not doing, or is it because of the weaker than expected environment, or both?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Brian Moynihan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">We have been driving the company, and so there\u2019s been two basic pieces of strategy.  One is to continue to push the legacy issues and costs out of the company and at the same time take the company and drive the underlying business metrics.  So that\u2019s been going on.  And as we clean up more of the former, then the focus of the company is on the latter.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And involved in the latter, in other words driving the core company, was that we had, say in credit card, a big book of business that we were running off.  We\u2019re getting towards the end of that, or less impact quarter to quarter, and now we\u2019ve got to grow the credit card business.  This quarter I think we did 900,000-plus credit cards, which is the highest amount we\u2019ve done in the quarters since 2008 or something like that.  And 70% of those are through the branch structure and through the preferred business and things like that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">So the goal is to continue to drive this company and get the value of the combination of all the pieces of the business through it.  It\u2019s not a new push.  It\u2019s just, as the other issues go away, this is what the team has to be focused on.  So we\u2019re seeing great progress in some of the businesses, and look at the GWIM business and look at the connectivity to the GWIM business.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">We literally have millions of referrals that go between businesses a year.  We goal those at 30-50% increases every year, and we see that number being hit and is tracked in every single market, 100-plus markets, with about 20 different pieces of business flows between businesses tracked that we track and monitored on a monthly basis.  It\u2019s all geared to just driving the value of the franchise, and frankly delivering to customers the entire franchise.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And so it appears in all the businesses, whether it\u2019s in the commercial business, bringing our 401k platform, which is new to the Bank of America structure since Merrill came in.  And we just see wins in that happening every day.  It is bringing the capital markets expertise deeper into our middle market business.  It\u2019s bringing the personal side of the wealth management business to our business entrepreneurs.  It\u2019s all those things.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And so new is a word that probably overstresses it.  It\u2019s just what we have to do to drive the revenue and continue to work the expenses to produce the bottom line we need.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">So you\u2019re farther along with the cleanup, just more external focus?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Brian Moynihan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And one of the tough things is we have 260,000 people in this company, and a lot of them have been focused on this.  And it\u2019s just their time to shine.  And the rest of what Bruce and I have been working on, and others, restructuring, balancing, getting the capital up, getting liquidity, legacy issues, is starting to fade away.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And back to the litigation, the 10-K and some 10-Qs say that if the courts disagree with the argument of loss causation, then the reserves may need to go up.  And that has not taken place.  Your range of possible loss is about the same.  So I\u2019m trying to reconcile those two thoughts.  Because it seems as though with Assured versus Flagstar, loss causation was shot down, there\u2019s some other comments in the court.  So how do I reconcile what happened with Flagstar, some other court comments, that shoot down loss causation with the comment in your 10-K?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I\u2019m not going to drill into the Flagstar case, but I want to be clear, Flagstar gave a borrower fraud reference, and that was part of that case, which is not something we\u2019ve done.  But at a high level, Mike, that\u2019s correct.  It\u2019s in the disclosure.  And as I said in my earlier comments, within the litigation reserve during the quarter, we reassess those every quarter, and we did provide within the litigation expense some element of cost with respect to monolines during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">And the big question here is what happens if the $8.5 billion settlement doesn\u2019t go through.  And I asked Bank of New York that question this morning, and the answer from Bank of New York is, well, it\u2019s up to the courts to decide.  But what if the courts decide the $8.5 billion agreement does not go through?  What would be the impact on your reserves?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">The court is not opining on a number.  They\u2019re either opining on approving or not approving.  And obviously if they don\u2019t approve, we\u2019ve set up reserves within the Countrywide securities, assuming that every trust gets to the 25% threshold.  And so obviously, if it doesn\u2019t get approved, this will revert back to going individual trust by trust and working through it.  But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to comment on reserves on something that is not going to happen.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">You have $8.5 billion in reserves for the $8.5 billion settlement, and that may change, but you\u2019ll wait and see what happens on May 30.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">That\u2019s correct, and I think the other important thing is when we set up the $8.5 billion to the Countrywide, we also used that same methodology with respect to bank issued securitization rep and warrant to set up reserves based on the same methodology across the company.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">We\u2019ll take our final question from the line of Paul Miller from FBR.  Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Thomas [Latourneau] - FBR Capital Markets </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">This is actually Thomas [Latourneau] on behalf of Paul.  I have a quick follow up, and I just want to make sure I heard you guys right.  Did you say that 50% of your total originations were HARP?  And if so, do you think you can replace that with other normal retail volume if HARP starts to dissipate in the back half of the year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">The 50% was both MHA as well as HARP.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Brian Moynihan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">And in fact if you think about it year over year, the growth rate of those activities has been a strong growth rate.  And that\u2019s the challenge going forward, is just how we keep originating a broader product set?  But right now that is an opportunity which is here and near, and it goes away over time.  But the rest of the production continues to grow at a fast pace also.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Thomas [Latourneau] - FBR Capital Markets </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">And one additional question.  Can you tell me what type of products you\u2019re actually portfolioing right now?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Within the consumer mortgage business?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Thomas [Latourneau] - FBR Capital Markets </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Largely nonconforming.  What we want to do is provide the mortgage product and balance sheet for that which there isn\u2019t another alternative, and we\u2019re pressing hard within the different businesses.  The mortgage activity within the wealth management business this quarter was very strong as well as within the [mass affluent] client space.  So that\u2019s largely the focus.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Brian Moynihan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Just on the underwriting of those, though, you should rest assured that the underwriting is consistent with very strong underwritings going on in the industry in total right now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Kevin Stitt</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Okay, I think we\u2019re through the questions.  So once again, thanks for joining us this morning, and we\u2019ll be talking with you next quarter.  </p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Copyright policy: </strong>All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

[Operator instructions.] It\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the program over to Lee McEntire. Please begin, sir.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Lee McEntire</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning to those on the phone or joining us by webcast. Before Bruce Thompson and Brian Moynihan begin their comments, let me remind you that this presentation, available at bankofamerica.com does contain some forward-looking statements regarding both our financial condition and financial results, and that these statements involve certain risks that may cause actual results in the future to be different from our current expectations. And please see our press release and SEC documents for further information.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">With that, let me turn it over to our CEO, Brian Monynihan.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you, Lee. Good morning everyone, and just to start off, let me remind you of what our focus is and has been for some time: on capital generation, on managing our risk, on continuing to reduce our costs, and on addressing the legacy issues so that we can drive our growth strategy by simply doing more with our customers and clients.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">This quarter shows very clearly how the focus is paying off, as we earned $4 billion. We built our company over the last several quarters to maintain stability, and we\u2019ll continue to make progress to withstand the volatility that we saw in part again this quarter while delivering for our customers and shareholders.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">And that came true, even as mortgage demand has decreased, we still had a 40% increase in retail production over last year, and an increase over the last quarter. Even as interest rates rose, we were able to add to our capital ratios. And keep in mind, with our trillion-dollar deposit book, rising rates will continue to increase the value of those over time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We have leading capabilities in the areas where our customers want us to be. We do more business with them and we\u2019re gaining momentum across every customer group. And while we\u2019re doing that, our balance sheet continues to strengthen, our capital ratio has again moved higher, and just as importantly, we\u2019ve begun the process of returning capital to our shareholders.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Our credit quality continues to improve. Expenses are down by $1 billion from a year ago. LAS, or Legacy Asset Servicing, expenses, excluding our litigation, are down by nearly $800 million on a quarterly basis, from the peak only a couple of quarters ago, and are ahead of our projections.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Our loans and our deposits continue to grow. All the businesses produced solid, stable revenues in the focus areas where we are growing that grew their revenues. And we\u2019re seeing growing activity levels across all our customer and client groups.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">So as we look forward, we\u2019re closely following recent regulatory proposals around capital and leverage, just as you are. Obviously we have already taken significant steps in our company to build our current strong levels of capital and liquidity, and we maintain a comfort level here that Bruce will take you through the numbers later.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">The good news in all this is that we\u2019re seeing in our business as reflected in our improved economy. The economy continues to improve across all areas. That benefits our company across multiple fronts, but most importantly, with an improving economy, it strengthens and creates opportunity for the people, companies, and investors that we serve, and that opportunity will continue to provide opportunity for us to capture and to connect all our capabilities to help those that we serve realize their financial goals.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">With that, let me turn it over to Bruce.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Thanks, Brian, and good morning everyone. I\u2019m going to start on slide five of our presentation materials. Total revenues for the quarter were very solid at $22.9 billion, and we earned $4 billion, or $0.32 per diluted share, which is up significantly both from the first quarter of this year as well as the comparable period in 2012.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We made significant progress in all of our primary businesses this quarter, and on a linked quarter basis, we had growth in four out of the five businesses. Consumer activity levels were solid, as mortgage production increased, credit card loan balances stabilized, and both deposits and brokerage flows increased from the previous quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Global wealth and investment management reported another quarter of record revenues, as well as earnings. Global banking revenue showed continue strength, driven by increased lending in both our commercial as well as our corporate bank, and investment banking performance remained strong and close to record levels.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Total noninterest expense of $16 billion represented a significant improvement in expenses, both relative to the first quarter of this year as well as the comparable quarter in 2012, and asset quality improved significantly as our provision expense declined to $1.2 billion this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">On slide six, we give some balance sheet highlights. First, the overall size of the balance sheet came down this quarter to about $2.125 trillion. Importantly, customer activity remained strong, with loans, led by our commercial loans, up $10 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Period end deposits were down, driven by seasonality associated with tax payments. However, our average deposits did experience modest growth. And also call out on the page the tangible book value per share remained relatively flat from the first quarter of this year. That\u2019s significant in the context of our $4 billion of earnings largely offset the negative after-tax impact from accumulated other comprehensive income, driven by the increase in rates that we saw during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Also helping our tangible book value per share in the quarter was the return of roughly $1 billion of capital through the repurchase of 80 million common shares at a price below tangible book value. And as we look forward, we have an additional $4 billion available for common share repurchases.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">The combination of the earnings that I discussed on slide five, as well as the work that we did on our balance sheet, led to a return on tangible common equity of just under 10% for the quarter, and a return on average assets of 74 basis points.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">On slide 7, we walk through some of the different regulatory capital ratios as far as where we ended up at the end of the second quarter. If we start with Basel 1 tier one common ratio, we ended the quarter at 10.83%, up 34 basis points from the first quarter of this year and 45 basis points on a pro forma basis at the end of 2012.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Moving to Basel III, fully phased in basis under the advanced approach, and based on final rules, our tier one common ratio was 9.6%, showing progress from the first quarter of \u201913, despite a 32 basis point negative impact from the change in OCI during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Risk-weighted assets under Basel III were $1.31 trillion, or $43 billion lower than the first quarter of \u201913, due to an improvement in both the composition as well as the overall credit quality on the books.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">If we move to the proposed supplementary U.S. leverage ratio requirement, which will kick in at the beginning of 2018, our preliminary analysis indicates that at the holding company, our leverage ratio for the second quarter of 2013 was in the range of 4.9% to 5%, which positions us very well relative to the 5% minimum.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">If we look at our primary bank subsidiaries, which we have two, BANA, our primary banking subsidiary, and FIA, our card subsidiary, during the second quarter of 2013, both of those were in excess of the 6% proposed minimum. So net-net, from a regulatory capital perspective, we feel like we\u2019ve made very good progress across all of the different measures that will be required to operate within.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On page eight, funding and liquidity, you can see long term debt during the quarter declined $18 billion, as maturities outpaced issuances during the quarter. Our global excess liquidity sources did decline during the quarter. It was expected as a result of our reductions in the long term debt footprint, our preferred stock redemptions, as well as the seasonal deposit outflows that I referenced earlier from tax payments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">At the parent company, liquidity remains very strong at $95 billion, due to capital returns from our subsidiaries during the quarter. Time to required funding increased to 32 months, up from 29 months in the first quarter of \u201913, and well above our target of approximately 24 months. And as we\u2019ve indicated before, over the next four to six quarters, we will look to move that time to funding towards the 24 months as we repay the upcoming debt maturities in 2013 and 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On net interest income, if you look at slide 9, net interest income on an FTE basis was $10.8 billion, down just about 1% from the first quarter of 2013. If you adjust our net interest income for market-related items, it was $10.4 billion, which was less than $100 million below our guidance, as our trading-related net interest income declined as a result of reduced balance sheet utilization in our global markets business during the last month of the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On the positive side, we benefited during the quarter from lower long term debt, higher levels of commercial loan balances, as well as one additional day of interest in the second quarter relates to the first. On the flipside, in addition to the negative impact of lower asset balances on the trading books, we also had slightly lower consumer loan balances and yields, driven by our runoff portfolios.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">As we came into the second quarter of 2013, our interest rate sensitivity as we disclosed in the first quarter 10-Q, estimated a $1.6 billion annual benefit to net interest income from a 100 basis point instantaneous [long end] steepening if rates remained at that level.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">During the second quarter, the 10-year rate did increase by more than 60 basis points, and we realized $300 million of that benefit immediately through the impact on FAS 91. We expect to realize the balance of the benefit, approximately $700 million, over the course of the next 12 months.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">As a result of those different factors, we do expect net interest income, excluding any market related impacts, to build off of the second quarter of 2013\u2019s $10.4 billion adjusted level as we move forward during the balance of 2013 and into 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">If you look at the work that we did on expenses, on slide 10, total expenses were down significantly, on both a linked quarter as well as a year over year basis as we continued to deliver on the expense reductions that we discussed within our legacy assets and servicing area, as well as the ongoing cost savings from our new BAC initiatives that we\u2019re implementing in the other businesses that we operate.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Our number of full-time equivalent employees in the quarter ended at just over 257,000, which was down 2% from the first quarter of 2013 and almost 7% from the comparable period a year ago.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Total expenses did decline $3.5 billion from the first quarter of \u201913 as we benefited from a $1.7 billion decline in litigation. Our LAS expenses ex-litigation were down roughly another $250 million. Our retirement eligible costs, which we only incur during the first quarter of each year, were down $900 million, and all other expenses were down approximately $600 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">As we look at the progress that we make on our LAS expenses, from the fourth quarter of 2012, when they peaked at $3.1 billion, we are now down approximately $800 million from that peak. And we did all of that within the last two quarters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As a result, we previously had said that our LAS expenses, ex-litigation, would be approximately $2.1 billion by the end of 2013, meaning in the fourth quarter of 2013, and with the progress that we\u2019ve made, we now believe our fourth quarter LAS expenses will be below $2 billion in the fourth quarter of \u201913.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">And keep in mind that as we work through these, the realization of these savings can be somewhat lumpy. In addition to our LAS expenses, the $600 million improvement in all other cost was driven primarily by lowering incentive compensation costs during the quarter as well as our new BAC efforts. We remain on track to achieve $1.5 billion of new BAC quarterly savings by the fourth quarter of 2013.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On slide 11, we give some information on the trends from an asset quality perspective, and as you can see, credit quality once again improved significantly during the quarter. Net chargeoffs declined to $2.1 billion, an improvement of 16% on a linked quarter basis, and 42% relative to the second quarter of 2012.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Our second quarter of 2013 net loss rate of 94 basis points is the first time that we\u2019ve been below 100 basis points since 2006. Given the improving trend in delinquencies and other metrics, we now expect our net chargeoffs will come in below $2 billion in the third quarter of 2013.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Provision expense of $1.2 billion this quarter does reflect a reserve reduction of approximately $900 million, reflecting improving credit trends. The allowance coverage remains strong, and given the pace of improvement in credit quality, we do anticipate continued reserve releases, particularly in our consumer real estate portfolios.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Let\u2019s now move to a discussion of the performance within our lines of business on slide 12. Before we go through the results, I do want to highlight a technical change that this quarter we did move our direct and indirect auto and other specialty lending into the CPB business from global banking given that it more closely connects with consumer lending activity. This book does include $37 billion of loans, and we have adjusted prior periods to have this data be comparable.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Earnings in the business were relatively stable compared to the first quarter of \u201913, and up 15% from the prior year, driven by both expense improvements as well as lower credit costs. We do continue to do more business with our core customers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Our average deposits were up almost $9 billion from the first quarter of \u201913, excluding the transfers that we had from the wealth management business. Loans declined a modest 1% as a decline in our credit cards was mitigated by our balance growth in both small business as well as auto lending.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">There\u2019s been a lot of discussion on our U.S. credit card balances. Those balances appear to have stabilized and at the end of the second quarter were at $90.5 billion, up from $90 billion at the end of the first quarter of this year. Our card issuance remains strong in the second quarter, and is at its highest level since 2008.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">U.S. consumer credit card retail spend for average active account was up 9% from the same quarter a year ago. We continue to optimize our delivery network, and usage within the mobile channel continues to increase. And lastly, expense levels reflect both the benefits of the network optimization as well as the investments to build out our specialty sales force.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">If we move to consumer real estate services, on slide 13, we address home loans, one of the two businesses within our CRES segment. First mortgage retail originations were $25 billion and were up 6% from the first quarter and 41% compared with retail originations in the year ago period.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Our market share in the retail mortgage space improved. We broke through 5% versus below 4% just over a year ago. We do anticipate some slowdown in mortgage production resulting from recent increases in interest rate, and that is seen by the 5% reduction in our mortgage origination pipeline at the end of June relative to what we had seen at the end of March this year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">While production has experienced a nice trajectory over the last year, we, like the industry, have experienced compression on margins that affects revenue. While these margins do remain high relative to historical periods, the compression is most notable when you look at our year over year production revenue.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We continued to add mortgage loan officers during the second quarter, primarily in the banking centers, as well as other employees in our sales and fulfillment area, in order to deliver a first class mortgage experience for our customers. These actions did contribute to higher expenses in the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On slide 14, we moved to legacy assets and servicing, which still did report a loss in the quarter, but showed significant improvement from the first quarter, which included the MBIA and RMBS litigation settlements as the reduction in expenses more than offset a decline in the revenues.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Revenues were negatively impacted by a servicing revenue decline of $175 million, as the servicing portfolio declined 17% and we had less favorable MSR hedge performance. That was partially offset by higher sales volume of loans that returned to performing status.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">As you look at LAS, several key takeaways from this slide. The first is our level of 60-plus day delinquent loans, which is one of the primary drivers of the elevated cost, dropped below 500,000 units at the end of June, a 27% decline from the results at the end of the first quarter of \u201913.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Recall our number of 60-plus day delinquent loans peaked at almost 1.4 million units at the end of 2010. Looking ahead, we now expect our amount of 60-plus day delinquent loans to come down further than we originally expected to below 375,000 units by the end of 2013. As we continue to reduce these loans, the number of employees and contractors will come down, and you can see that by the decrease of 5,000 people during this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Expenses, ex-litigation, once again were down roughly $250 million from the first quarter to $2.3 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Global wealth and investment management, on slide 15, had a great quarter, with our results once again reflecting records in revenues, earnings, as well as pretax margin. Year over year, revenue increased 10%, and net income grew by 38%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Our second quarter pretax margin of about 28% benefited from strong revenue performance as well as improved credit costs during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Long term AUM flows were solid at nearly $80 billion in the quarter, more than double the flows that we saw in the prior year ago period.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Ending loan balances grew $5 billion in the quarter to record levels, while ending deposits declined $5 billion due to the seasonality of tax payments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Global banking, on slide 16, experienced strong loan growth and slightly higher investment banking fees compared to the first quarter of 2013, both of which helped drive $1.3 billion in net income and a 22% return on allocated equity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">The investment banking strength kept fees near record levels and we retained our second place ranking in net investment banking fees. Within the investment bank, underwriting fees continued the momentum from near record levels during the first quarter of \u201913, and were up 53% from the second quarter of 2012.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Equity underwriting fees grew 10% relative to the first quarter of \u201913, and up 86% from the comparable year ago period, due to the strong global IPO market, as well as our focus on continuing to grow capabilities within this space.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On the balance sheet, average loans increased by almost $12 billion from the first quarter, driven by growth in both corporate C&amp;I as well as commercial real estate. As you look at that loan growth, I think it\u2019s important to note the strong diversity in lending to our global customer base, as the U.S. represented approximately 40% of the growth, with the balance outside the U.S.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We switch to global markets, on slide 17. We earned roughly $1 billion during the quarter, on revenue of $4.2 billion, which is up significantly from the second quarter of 2012 results, but down from the first quarter of \u201913. The business during the second quarter generated a 13% return on allocated equity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Sales and trading revenue, if we back out DVA, was $3.5 billion, solidly above our 2012 results. Fixed sales and trading was down versus the second quarter of \u201912, as well as the first quarter of \u201913, given the rate volatility and spread widening that we saw during the last month of the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Equity sales and trading had a very strong quarter, actually the best that we\u2019ve seen since the first quarter of 2011. Results, ex-DVA, were up 53% from the second quarter of 2012, and 4% over the first quarter of \u201913, as we continued to gain market share and cash equities, improved our performance in equity derivatives, and had higher client balances in our financing area.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">If you look at the balance sheet, trading asset levels did decline as we reduced risk during the end of the second quarter. Average VAR, at a 99% confidence level, was $69 million in the quarter, down from $80 million in the first quarter of last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On slide 18, we walk you through the results of our all other segment, which includes global principal investments, our non-U.S. consumer card business, our discretionary portfolio associated with interest rate risk management, insurance, as well as our international wealth management area.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Gains on the sale of debt securities were $452 million in the second quarter of \u201913, compared to $67 million in the first quarter and $354 million in the second quarter of 2012. That, coupled with the prior quarter costs for retirement eligible compensation, lower litigation expense, higher equity investment income, and lower provision for credit losses, due primarily to the improvement in the residential mortgage portfolio, drove the significant improvement in earnings in this segment compared to both the first quarter of this year and the prior year ago period.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Before we leave this slide, two things I would note for modeling purposes as it relates to preferred dividends and taxes. The first, preferred dividends, we expect our preferred dividends to drop from $441 million this quarter to about $280 million in the third quarter, and then settle in around $260 million per quarter as we move forward. These declines are the result of the reduction of the $5.5 billion of preferred stock this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">If we move to taxes, the effective tax rate for the quarter was 27%. As we look out during the balance of the year, we would expect the rate to be approximately 30% plus or minus any unusual items like the U.K. tax rate reduction.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">As we\u2019ve disclosed previously, this year\u2019s expected U.K. corporate income tax rate is likely to be reduced by 3%, and will be enacted in the third quarter of this year. As a result, for modeling purposes, you should include a charge of approximately $1.1 billion associated with the writedown of our U.K. deferred tax assets in the third quarter of this year. But keep in mind, given where we are from a DTA disallowance position, this will not impact our Basel I or Basel III capital ratios.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">And before we wrap up and take questions, I\u2019d like to leave you with a couple of thoughts about the second quarter performance. We achieved many of the objectives that we laid out for the quarter. Revenue was solid, costs came down significantly, credit continued to improve, and our capital ratios remained strong and improved despite the change in both OCI as well as the initiation of our share repurchase program during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">The higher rate environment, to the extent it stays with us, allows us to improve our net interest income going forward, and we plan to continue to drive forward, execute on our strategy, and deliver on the earnings capability of our company.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And with that, operator, we\u2019ll go ahead and open it up for questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p7\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">[Operator instructions.] We\u2019ll go first to the site of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">A couple of questions on improving RWAs. You mentioned that credit helped drive the RWAs down a little bit. Could you give a little bit more color on how much of the HPI improvement has already come through the RWAs? Is there any more to come from what\u2019s happened so far in your 3Q and 4Q outlook?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">When we referenced the improving credit quality, you can look at it in three different buckets. The first, which you\u2019ve already pointed out, clearly HPI under Basel III as home prices go up, there\u2019s benefit to that. And that improvement accounted for roughly a third of the improvement we saw during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">The other two things that we benefited from was at the end of the quarter we had less risk on the books, so that obviously the reduction in risk provided some benefit. And then third, the overall credit quality of the wholesale book that we had seen also improved. So within that credit quality characterization, it was those three things.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">As we look forward, any further improvement that we have with respect to risk-weighted assets is going to be a function of home prices. Obviously the [prints] that we\u2019ve seen during this quarter continue to be strong, and to the extent that the improvement continues, we would expect to benefit from that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">The other thing that is noteworthy, and you see this, is that we do continue to run off a fair bit of legacy positions within the consumer mortgage portfolio, and you saw that the home equity lines of credit reduced by about another $3.5 billion during the quarter, and that obviously provides some benefit as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And then a follow up on your comment regarding the outlook for NII, where you indicated that NII excluding market related items could build from the $10.4 billion at 2Q \u201913. Could you describe how you\u2019re thinking about that? I\u2019ve had a lot of conversations over the last quarter about what you put in your Q, which is a 100 basis point back up in rates, meaningful increase in EPS. That\u2019s got to come more from reinvesting the cash flow of the securities portfolio. Can you give us a sense of how you drive higher NII?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Well, in the Q we put out two different numbers. The first is the 100 basis point parallel shift, which at the end of the first quarter I believe we said was either $3.6 billion or $3.7 billion, and then we had the steepening, where just long rates went up, and we had had the $1.6 billion that I referenced.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Obviously as we look at net interest income in the future, we\u2019ve not seen a parallel shift at this point, we\u2019ve just seen a steepening. And that\u2019s why, in my comments, I referenced the $1.6 billion. But as we look forward and look forward from a net interest income perspective, to the extent that long end rates are higher and we are investing excess liquidity at the company, we will benefit from being able to invest at higher rates.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">The other two items that we have that will benefit net interest income going forward is we do continue to take down the debt footprint. And you can see that commercial loan balances are moving up as well. And we\u2019d expect the combination of those things to more than offset some of the declines in both balances and yields we\u2019ve seen on the consumer side.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">If you think about, sort of over the last several quarters, we\u2019ve been fighting the runoff portfolios. And the impact of those going forward continues to mitigate. So if you look at some of the information, the card balance is actually growing quarter to quarter, whether even the home equities, the size of the runoff portfolio in mortgage is lower. You assume those had higher yields in the general case, so the stuff coming out and replacing now helps replace those yields and is better in securities. So that gives us confidence that we\u2019re starting to see the growth that helps drive the core NIM up.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And would you be looking to shift some of the liquidity pool into securities? Obviously it would be longer duration on the liquidity pool.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">As we\u2019ve always said, the first places we continue to build liquidity that we\u2019re looking to place it is within the lines of business to fund loan growth from those customers. And if you look at this quarter, and you look at the balance sheet, you saw some of that in that our overall securities balances I believe were down about $18 billion, whereas our average overall loans were up. So clearly the lines of business, to the extent that we continue to originate well-structured, well-priced loans that return the way that we\u2019d like, that\u2019s where the liquidity is going to go first. The excess liquidity is invested, and in this environment we continue to be very mindful of the OCI risk and will manage with the mindset of mitigating that risk.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And then just lastly on the [unintelligible] pretax margin, pretty strong number this quarter. And I know last quarter you called out some one-timers. Were there any one-timers in that this quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">The only one-timer that I think jumps out is if you look at it you can see that we actually had a negative provision of about $15 million for the quarter. A more normalized provision number within that business is probably $25 million to $50 million, but not unlike the balance of our consumer real estate portfolio, the consumer lending with respect to mortgages in that segment benefits from the increase home prices we\u2019ve seen. That\u2019s probably the one anomaly that [unintelligible]\u2019s mentioning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Brian Moynihan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">John Thiel and David Darnell, John runs the business, along with Keith Banks at U.S. Trust, have done a good job. If you look at the [unintelligible] year over year, I think there\u2019s a 10% increase in expenses. Went up 3% in the business, which as you know has high sensitivity to compensation increases. So they just have been doing all the hard work and the new BAC work like everybody else. And so as the markets rose, they\u2019ve benefited dramatically from it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And so what\u2019s the targeted pretax margin there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Over time, as we look at where we are, and I want to highlight over time, we think that can get to a margin of 30%. But at the same time, as you\u2019ve accurately called out, we were at 28% this quarter, and we did have some benefit from the provision line.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Over time includes the higher interest rate environment?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Brian Moynihan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yes. But they\u2019ve got a lot of loans, deposits, and lending in there too, that benefits those rates.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">We\u2019ll go next to the site of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Within fixed income trading businesses, obviously June proved to be a tough month, I think, for a lot of folks, and it seemed like the trends were maybe a little bit weaker than we\u2019re seeing elsewhere when we factor in some of the charges you had in the first quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">A couple of things on the fixed income business. Let\u2019s look at it year over year, because this business probably has the most seasonality with respect to the first quarter. If you look at year over year, and if you looked within the businesses, within both the rates and currencies area as well as the different credit trading areas, which we look at investment grade, high yield, as well as our loan sales and trading, the performance year over year was actually pretty good.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Where we had weakness in the second quarter of this year is in three areas. The first is that we continue to run off the structured credit trading book and you had a pretty significant decline during the second quarter of \u201913 relative to the prior year from the continued runoff of that book. From a P&amp;L perspective, it\u2019s largely runoff at this point, so we\u2019re not going to have to discuss that much going forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">The other two areas on a relative basis that were weaker, we have a very significant business that\u2019s got number one market shares in the municipal finance space, and if you look at the prices in the spread widening, it was very dramatic during the month of June in the muni space. That negatively affected us. And then in the mortgage space, obviously the market widened out significantly there, and we had some lumpy items in the second quarter of 2012 as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So I think as you look at the quarter, and you look at the fixed income business, once again we run it as a holistic business between new issue and sales and trading. The new issue business had a great quarter. Those areas where the markets were good, rates and currencies, credit trading across the board, actually performed pretty well in the three areas that I mentioned. One, because it\u2019s running off and two, given the market dynamics, didn\u2019t perform as well as we would have expected.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So just as we think about [unintelligible] going forward, maybe a little bit of a lower run rate as you ran down the structural trading, but also hopefully less volatility given that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I think that\u2019s fair. And just to give you a sense, the structured credit trading book this quarter was less than $100 million, so as you look at the go forward basis, there\u2019s just not much left. <strong> </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Brian Moynihan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">As you look at slide 17, what Tom Montag and team have been able to do is to continue to take advantage of opportunities. Of the equities business, last year we were still a work in progress, but they have rebuilt that business and it\u2019s doing well. The fixed income, Bruce just ran you through that. But look at the ability to drive the profit by getting the expenses lined up well. So on a year over year basis, the profit increased by $460 million, because we were able to maintain expense discipline at the same time as the revenue went up.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And so I think the key there is that we\u2019re trying to manage that business in the context of who we are as an entire company, in the markets business, and Tom and team continue to drive where the opportunities are and pick a side. I think they had a very good quarter, but when you step back and look at it holistically, their ability quarter after quarter to drive a good return on capital, even in more volatile spaces where we got obviously hit a little bit and [unintelligible] in the latter part of the quarter, is very solid.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">We do see good core trends in the [high] banking fees and of course the equities business you mentioned. And just separately, if we look at loan loss provision expense going forward, you gave us some components of chargeoffs and then just kind of big picture some more reserve release. But any thoughts on just the specific level of provision expense going forward? I think you had been targeting 1.8 to 2.2, which obviously you broke through that now for a couple of quarters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I think it\u2019s a good question. What I would point to is that credit quality across the board, and particularly as you look at early stage delinquencies, as well as what we\u2019re seeing as we move some of the consumer real estate out, is quite strong.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">As we\u2019ve said, we think the chargeoff number will come below $2 billion in the third quarter. And as you look at the reserve release, the reserve release this quarter roughly 650 of it was from core reserves and roughly 250 of it was from PCI. We can\u2019t project PCI, but I think if you look at the core 650 and take the chargeoff guidance that we\u2019ve given, absent any change in home prices, you get a sense as to where we\u2019re trending.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">We\u2019ll go next to the site of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I was wondering if you had any sense of where we might think of legal expense going forward. It came down a lot this quarter. You got some things behind you. How should we think of that number going forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">As we look at legal expense, it\u2019s always a little bit difficult to predict, but the just under $500 million that we saw this quarter, it\u2019s clearly at an elevated level from what we\u2019d expect long term. At the same time, within the $500 million, there was nothing lumpy from the quarter. So I always hesitate to say too much on that, because it is lumpy, but the $500 million number as it relates to a base level, at least what we can tell in the near term, is probably not a bad level to keep.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And putting expenses all together, the $16 billion is probably a pretty good jumping off point for us to think going forward starting in the third quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">That\u2019s correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And then on the quarterly LAS trend, you mentioned getting below $2 billion by the end of this year. Any thoughts on what your destination might be by the end of 2014? Ultimately you want to get that number down to $500 million, right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We previously said we\u2019d get a billion out this year, and a billion in 2014. We will be at a lower level at the end of \u201913, as we\u2019ve said today, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to think we\u2019ll get another billion out in \u201914 relative to that lower level.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And just separately, you mentioned the DTA. I assume the DTA consumption is still helping drive up your capital ratios. Can you remind us how much DTA you have right now and how much is disallowed?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Right now, on a disallowed basis, under Basel 1.5, it\u2019s in the zipcode of $15 billion to $16 billion. I think the important thing to keep in mind is during the quarter we didn\u2019t get the benefit that you would think from the DTA, because the impact of OCI offset that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">But normally, you\u2019d probably be building at close to the pretax rate you said before?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Absolutely.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Last thing for me, on the NII, can you just review that again? The benefit you talked about, that\u2019s a benefit from the 10-year moving up. And did you say that you received $300 million of that benefit that\u2019s already in the 10.4 that we see this quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">No, the 300 was in the 10.8. The 10.4 backs out to 300.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So the benefit, the 700, that\u2019s to come over the next 12 months?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yeah, the 700 would be the benefit, all other things being equal, off of that $10.4 billion number. And that\u2019s just the benefit from the move in rates, not anything else to do with the balance sheet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay, but you\u2019re thinking of that as helping the core number grow, right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">That\u2019s correct. The 700 that\u2019s left is all core. The 300 was in the pre-adjustment number that we reported of 10.8 this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And you have additional benefits beyond that if short rates rise? Is that the point you were making earlier?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">That\u2019s correct. And that\u2019s the important point. And I\u2019m just going to speak to what we had in the first quarter. The difference between 100 basis point parallel shift and a 100 basis point on the long end is an incremental $2.1 billion, which is to your short end question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Brian Moynihan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">The power of the deposit franchise and the short rate rise, because the mix is so transactional and core oriented, that\u2019s where there\u2019s a lot of lift left that\u2019s not shown up yet, obviously, because of the steepness of the curve.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">We\u2019ll take our next question from the site of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I just want to confirm. I believe you guys said in the past that when we look at the revenue declines from the sales and the MSR, in the LAS business, versus the corresponding reduction in expenses, we should kind of count on a lag on that front. Is that right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yeah, there\u2019s always a lag of three to six months from when the work goes away to when the actual employees that are working on that, as well as the expenses associated with it, leave the income statement.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And in your experience, generally what is the MSR purchase market like at this point? Are you guys still out there shopping MSRs? And how sensitive are those buyers to home prices?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I want to make sure we clear up on question that we get a lot on this. We worked hard to enter into the MSR sales that we entered into at the end of 2012. And a lot of the goal associated with that was to be able to reduce the work so we could take the expenses out of our legacy assets and servicing area. We entered into a number of transactions in the fourth quarter of 2012 and those will close throughout 2013. The most significant sales have already closed, and there will be some smaller sales that close during the balance of this year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Outside of the closing of those sales, any activity that you see from an MSR perspective will only be because it makes so much sense, and it results in getting out loans that are very difficult to work out. But going forward, you should not expect to see any incremental MSR sales. And all the guidance we\u2019ve given you with respect to expense, as well as 60-plus day delinquencies, is solely based on us doing the work that we control.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And then on your AFS portfolio, I think you guys have indicated in the past it was of roughly two-year duration. Given your allocation to RMBS in that portfolio, did we see an extension of that duration? Can you help us get an idea about what the impact might have been during the quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">As you look at that, at one of the conferences we spoke at, the comment that we had made at that point was that as you look at the impact of OCI relative to net interest income, that it took between 2.5 to 3 years to be able to earn back the OCI that\u2019s lost through net interest income. And you\u2019re absolutely right that durations do widen in mortgage backed securities, so as we leave 2012, it\u2019s more in the context of 3 years to earn it back as opposed to the 2.5 to 3 years that we\u2019ve spoken about previously.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And then last one from me, the results in GWIM have definitely been impressive. Can you guys speak to any change we\u2019ve seen in high net worth risk appetite, or behavior, over the last year or so, and how sustainable you view that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Brian Moynihan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I think if you went a little shorter than that, in the first quarter the markets moved, people started putting money back in the market on a high net worth retail level. And I think that trend has continued. But there\u2019s still a lot of cash out there, and so if you look at some of the deposit dynamics, you can see that repositioning. So we [feel people are] constructive.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">We\u2019ve got our research experts that can give you their view of the S&amp;P levels and things like that, but from a general trend, from both in our private banking clients and their willingness to borrow money and put it to work for private banking and wealth management clients, and their investment patterns, we\u2019ve seen their willingness to take risks go up.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And you\u2019ve seen growth in our lending across the board, and that indicates that people are willing to take risk. I think if you looked back a year ago, people were not using lines, and were not asking for a lot of lines, and that\u2019s changed in the last couple of quarters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">We\u2019ll go next to the site of Paul Miller from FBR. Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Switching to the mortgage banking side, you\u2019ve got 5% market share, which you really built back in market share over the last year, year and a half. But most of them are refis. With rates going up, where do you think that market share goes to? Or do you think you\u2019ve done a pretty good job building up your purchase sales force to maintain that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">As you step back this quarter, our purchase percentage of our overall total went up to 17% from what I believe was right around 7% during the first quarter. So we started to see the purchase share go up. And as we look forward, we have roughly 12% deposit market share throughout the country. And if we\u2019re doing this business as well as we believe we can, we clearly would expect over time that that mortgage market share can grow from the 4 that we started at a year ago to the 5 that we\u2019re at today, up to a high single digit market share.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And as we look at where we are today, relative to going forward, and as we look at what some of our peers have said, the 5% decline in pipeline, end of second quarter currently versus the first quarter, is reflective of the fact that we are picking up share. Because the pipelines aren\u2019t down as much as some others.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brian Moynihan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">The other thing is about 70-odd percent, 72-74% I think it is, of the activity that we do in mortgage is really off the customer base. And so we now have more than half the mortgage loan officers that we had working through the branch retail stores, on teams of people along with the financial advisors, what we call FSAs, in the branch, and personal bankers and small business bankers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And so that business system is really taking hold. And the amount they\u2019re producing continues to grow, and that\u2019s where we placed a lot of the growth year over year. I think we\u2019re up to 700 to 800 or so mortgage loan officers, and mostly in that platform. That platform performs well from both real referral basis plus direct to consumer basis. And so we think that will serve us well as the market ebbs and flow between refi and purchase.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And then when you look at our purchase statistics, you also have to remember that we still have probably more than other of our peers, a lot of the government related refinancing business going through, which we identify for you. So if you sort of back that out, you see a more representative picture of how we\u2019re doing in the purchase market. But we\u2019ve got to make that transition happen, and the team will work hard at it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Rates have really moved up. Gain on sale margins you know are coming down, but can you give some color on where you\u2019ve seen gain on sale margins so far into the quarter? Or is it too early to tell?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brian Moynihan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">For the third quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yeah.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brian Moynihan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I think it\u2019s too early to tell. We\u2019ve only had a couple of weeks of activity, obviously. But they came down in the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yeah, they were down roughly 50 basis points during the second quarter relative to the first. And as Brian indicated, it\u2019s too early to tell this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brian Moynihan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Remember this is a business which ebbs and flows, and you know as well as anybody. Our goal in this business is to serve our customers well, and I think we\u2019ve rebuilt the platform to do that, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re having success. And so as the margins come in, they\u2019re still strong, we still make money in the business, but we\u2019ve got to monitor as we go forward. It doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019ll have to take expenses down like everybody else will if the volumes are not there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And did you disclose what your HARP percentage is? If you did, I missed it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Brian Moynihan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I don\u2019t know it off the top of my head.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">It\u2019s in the 40s.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">We\u2019ll go next to the site of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Thanks for the disclosure on the supplemental leverage ratio. I was wondering if you had any assessment of what the impact might be of the BIS proposal for add-ons on disallowed repo and CDS products sold and disallowed derivatives collateral.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I think this at this point, we\u2019ve worked hard, given that these rules came out at the end of last week, to be able to get to both the parent, as well as to be very specific about our two primary banking subsidiaries. The best that we can tell in the different releases, that\u2019s what the U.S. regulatory framework has focused on. There are obviously some different views that were put out in BIS, but we don\u2019t have a number for you on that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">That\u2019s fair. I know that\u2019s early days. And stipulating to the fact that, clearly, based on what you\u2019ve told us, and some stuff that we\u2019ve done, you are pretty much where you would need to be on the supplemental leverage ratio per the U.S. take. How would you think about managing your off balance sheet lending commitment to the extent that they do drive the denominator there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">It\u2019s one of the questions, and as we have different discussions that you raise, that as policy gets set on this, there is a concern that some of the policies out there possibly have an impact on the availability of undrawn credit.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And so directly to your point, to the extent that over time you\u2019re required to hold capital, in this case in the form of a leverage ratio, for committed, undrawn facilities, by definition the cost of those facilities, to have truly committee facilities, will need to migrate up over time so there\u2019s a fair return that\u2019s generated on the capital that needs to get held for those.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">To the extent that they\u2019re not committed, obviously the percentage that you need to hold is much less, but across the industry, to the extent that you need to hold capital for those in greater amounts, the cost will need to change over time. Keep in mind that doesn\u2019t kick in until 2018.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Fair enough. And to the numbers you gave, you obviously don\u2019t have a lot of pressure to do anything there. But you\u2019re right. It would seem like pricing of those facilities probably had to get rationalized.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">On the shares, you did initiate the share repurchase. You talked about that. But there was still a fairly meaningful amount of share creep in the quarter. Was that just employee grants? Or I would have expected to see those more in the first quarter. And should we expect that we\u2019re, at this point, kind of at a high for the year in terms of the share count? Or should it head back down to where it was, say, in the first quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">If you flip back to the balance sheet data that we present on page six, you can see that the actual number of outstanding shares for the quarter came down by 80 million, which is the 80 million shares that we told you we repurchased. The only variation in the supply chain on a fully diluted basis is the treatment of the 700 million shares that were associated with the Berkshire investment. And depending on the price of the stock, as well as where the preferred shares are, that fully diluted share count can bounce around a little bit. But on a pure shares outstanding, we came down by the 80 million that we show on slide six.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">When do you expect, at this point, to have completed the rationalization of the branch system?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">As you go back through the guidance, and what we\u2019ve spoken about, we wrapped up and did the new BAC for the consumer businesses at the beginning of 2011. And we had a plan to work through and to rationalize that branch network down to in the zipcode of 5,000 branches by the end of 2014. And beyond \u201914, at this point, we\u2019ll continue to evaluate and optimize the branch network going forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">What we\u2019ve been very pleased with as we look at that optimization of the network is two things<strong>. </strong> The first, as we\u2019ve rationalized the network in the markets that we operate, we\u2019ve been very pleased with our retention of both consumer deposits as well as overall relationships, and that is we\u2019ve rationalized that network. Our customers have continued to do business with us and just use a different branch.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And the second thing that I would mention is that you\u2019ve seen some announcements that in some of the more rural markets, we\u2019ve actually been able to sell those branches and generate decent premiums as we\u2019ve sold those. But in the near term, we\u2019ve got the plans through 5,000, and we\u2019ll continue to optimize based on the environment we\u2019re operating in.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">But it almost sounds like, based on the success that you\u2019ve had, that you\u2019ve outlined, that might encourage you to take it a little bit further? Or would that be reading too much into it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Brian Moynihan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">If you look at page 12, you have to sort of look at all the dynamics in there. So deposits up $50 billion from last year second quarter, the branch count down about 270, and the rate paid on deposits from 19 basis points down to 12 basis points. But importantly, look at the mobile banking customer, and the uses behind that. So this is a matter of continuing to optimize, as you said, the distribution system. But it\u2019s going to be led by the customer behavior change.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">In other words, we are seeing, because of our customer base, and because of our capabilities, like our online banking system is rated best in the business nine years in a row and things like that, the mobile banking system gets great feedback from our customers, seeing constant improvement, that our ability to do this is still in front of us, because we\u2019ve got to watch the customers behavior and how we change.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">There will be some point where the core store level will probably settle in, but you\u2019re seeing it work through, that if you sit there and have 10% more deposits and 5% less branches, and 30% more mobile customers, that\u2019s a pretty good dynamic in terms of expense base of the platform. And we\u2019ll continue to optimize it, but it\u2019s going to be led by our customers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">We\u2019ll go next to the site of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer &amp; Company. Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I\u2019m looking at the supplement on page 23, where you go through the consumer real estate services, and looking down the column that says home lending, year to date you have nearly $2 billion of revenues and only $94 million dropped to the bottom line. And I\u2019m wondering, is that lack of profitably some vagary of segment accounting? Or is the business just kind of marginally profitable? And if so, then why be in it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">The big thing there, remember in the home loan space that the only activity that\u2019s reflected within that is the front end or the origination side, as well as a small amount of the home equity book that\u2019s held there. Keep in mind, relative to our peers, all of the servicing assets and the profitability that comes out of the servicing asset for what I would characterize as the [\u201cgooder\u201d] current servicing is all based within the legacy assets and servicing segment. So a little bit of apples to oranges relative to our peers as to how we report it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I\u2019m sorry, the servicing revenues are in the LAS?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">That\u2019s correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And this is just origination?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. And is that kind of historically the norm, that origination is sort of a loss leader almost?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Brian Moynihan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I wouldn\u2019t say loss leader. You\u2019ve got to do it to make some money, but the value tends to be extracted through the servicing over time. But the reality is that we\u2019ve been building this up and investing in it, and as we sort of reach a level to where the investment is paying us back, we still have a lot of efficiency to get in this business too, on the front end.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And then overall, in terms of liquidity, it looks like your non loan earning assets were down by almost $40 billion this quarter. How much further do you suppose you can run those down as you reduce your debt footprint?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">On the liquidity side, keep in mind a big chunk, $18 billion, of what you saw was a result of what we saw in running down the debt footprint. And as we\u2019ve said, we\u2019ve got $13 billion of maturities left in the balance of \u201913, and just under $40 billion during 2014. So we will continue to be a net reducer of our debt balances, and we\u2019d expect that to continue to benefit the net interest income line.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">We\u2019ll move next to the site of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Could you talk a little bit about whether you either have - it doesn\u2019t look like it - or are planning to kind of retain mortgage loans in the second half of the year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I\u2019m not sure I understood.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Well, you know, you said in terms of the investment portfolio you\u2019d kind of be cognizant of the AOCI impact. You know, you could achieve a similar objective without that by retaining residential mortgages.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. So we would expect, and if you look at during the quarter, and you look at the composition, keep in mind that you do have loans repay. But during the quarter, as it relates to the origination activity that we had with our core clients, that there were about $13 billion of residential mortgage loans that were originated through the core platform, roughly a third of which were through our wealth management area, and the balance through our CPB segment. So there is an origination of activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And as I said, the investment portfolio is there to invest the residual of what\u2019s used. There will be some incremental investments during the year, but I don\u2019t think in the aggregate you should expect to see the overall level of securities balances change dramatically between now and the end of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And given that you\u2019ve been kind of ahead of or meeting, at least, regulatory capital levels faster than some of your large peers, what are the areas that you think could benefit from incremental capital investment, or where they might be divesting? Are there any opportunities there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">You\u2019ve seen two different levels of activities amongst our peers, you\u2019ve seen some looking to deploy and to invest in those areas where there are things that are being sold. And I think you see some of it as you look at our commercial loan activities. We\u2019re very much focused, given the capital and liquidity that we\u2019ve built, in using that capital and liquidity within our core customer segments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And so when you look at that liquidity, you look at our wealth management business, you\u2019ll see that the loan balances were up $5 billion Q1 to Q2, because of what we\u2019re doing from a securities lending perspective and a mortgage lending perspective. You look at the commercial loan balances. And so they were up $10 billion. That\u2019s not from buying loans or doing anything else.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I do think, though, to your point, some of that comes from being able to lend where other people are pulling back. So you\u2019re not going to see anything inorganic that we\u2019re doing. What you will see, and what you should expect from us, is to continue driving that growth in those customers areas where because of the dynamics that you mentioned, other people may be doing less.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Brian Moynihan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">If you link this question to the last question about the efficiency of the mortgage business, year over year we deploy about 5,000 people, about 25% increase, to make sure that we can close mortgages on time and meet the demand of the customers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So at the same time the headcount of the overall company is down significantly, we\u2019ve had that kind of investment go on. We have more commercial bankers today than we had a year ago. We have more small business bankers, financial services advisor branches. So we continue to make the investment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">It\u2019s not really about capital, I think, because we still have so many loan portfolios that are running off, that if we replace them it would be good core growth to replace them. It\u2019s more about expense dollars redeployment. That\u2019s where we make the judgments right now, and so this [a returning of] cost of capital on the allocated capital, which is regulatory minimums or above. But it\u2019s really a question of where to put the expense dollars, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on in the core business, and we have the best opportunity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Do you have a number in mind as to how much you would look to reinvest of the expense savings that you\u2019re generating?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Brian Moynihan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">It\u2019s a net number, so we don\u2019t give you a number that doesn\u2019t take account. But for this year, just to give you an example, we\u2019ll spend $1.1 billion in connection with the new BAC ideas, which are expense revenue and improving our company basis, that is on top of the $2.5 billion we spend otherwise in pure systems development initiatives to help drive this company. So there\u2019s investment going in.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">But all the numbers we give you are net of all the investments we\u2019re making. So we\u2019re giving a net number, but we are investing significantly at the same time. And that was what Bruce and the management team set out a few years ago, was we had to make sure we progressed the core franchise at the same time we brought the expense base and headcount down.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">We\u2019ll go next to the site of Nancy Bush with NAB Research. Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Nancy Bush - NAB Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">You\u2019ve made gains in market share and mortgage, and you said that you have stabilized the credit card. Are you going to be able to gain share in credit card? And how do you look to do that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Brian Moynihan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I think we\u2019re in a position for the first time in a long while\u2026 We\u2019ve been stabilizing credit card for a couple of quarters, because we\u2019ve seen it sort of settle in. We divested some portfolios, as you know. We sized out of some of the business that we didn\u2019t find attractive.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">In this quarter, we saw the increase for the first time I think in almost five years. And so the team produced about 975,000 new cards this quarter, up from 950-ish last quarter. That is a multiyear high in production, I think goes back to 2008. So we should see this go on.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Now, you have activity levels. You\u2019ve got to be careful in the summer and things like that. But overall, the baseline is set now, that restructured portfolio which we\u2019ve shown you guys, I think started at $15 billion to $20 billion several years ago, and it\u2019s now down to a few billion. So the underlying demand is there, that we should be able to grow the business and hold our share.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And if you look over the last couple of quarters, we\u2019re basically flattish sharewise, and card balance is a little bit down, but in line with the peers. And so we feel good that we finally have reached this point after five years of hard work of restructuring that business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Nancy Bush - NAB Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Is it a business where you want to gain share? If you could just sort of give your overall philosophy on the credit card business right now?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Brian Moynihan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">We will continue to drive share among our customers. We have low penetration in certain segments and low usage of our cards in other segments, and so we\u2019re driving it through three or four core products, the Cash 123 product for people who feel that\u2019s what they want in a card, through the travel rewards and other awards products, and we\u2019re seeing the cards come in through those core products and we\u2019re driving them. And yes, we want to grow share in the context of our customers in the select affinity teams that we work with across the country.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Nancy Bush - NAB Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">The second question I have is somewhat imprecise, and I apologize in advance. But I think what everybody is waiting for with your stock, and with the earnings outlook, is for this massive deposit gathering network to get profitable. And we understand that that is a function of short rates going up. Can you kind of walk us through this? Is there an ideal yield curve? Is there an absolute level of short rates? I mean, what do we have to see to begin to see the branches get massively profitable?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">The first thing, to your point, if you go to the supplement, during the second quarter the deposit segment within CPV did make $500 million during the quarter. As we look forward, though, more directly to your point, to the extent that the overall yield curve shifts up, and this is once again in our first quarter Q, that the benefit from a net interest income perspective on a 100 basis point parallel shift, as of the end of the first quarter, was over $3.5 billion, the lion\u2019s share of which is going to flow through the consumer segment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">So as it relates to where we are now, it is profitable. We\u2019ve made almost $500 million. We continue to optimize and reduce the expenses to make it more profitable. And you\u2019re correct, once rates go up, it will become much more so.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Nancy Bush - NAB Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">If I could just finally ask a corollary to that question, because of all the issues that you\u2019ve had in the past few years, with closing branches, changing branch models, several different sort of programs to change the retail footprint of the company, is there going to be a need as rates go up to give more of that benefit to your customers? In other words, are you going to have to act differently in deposit pricing this time around than you have in previous rate cycles?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Brian Moynihan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I think a lot of the adjustments we made on the fee side for the general consumer have already been made, and I think the customers have benefited dramatically from our position, and how we do overdrafts and other types of fees. So I think that is the payback to the customers. As rates rise, we will meet the market and grow the market as we\u2019ve been doing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">But interestingly enough, remember the constitution of our deposits across the last three years, we have run off a lot of CDs and other things which are not advantage products. And it\u2019s really become more and more core every single quarter. And that will play to our benefit, because transactional deposits, checking accounts are noninterest at this point, because as rates rise, there\u2019s no extra cost.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And we\u2019ll take our final question from the site of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I have three real small questions and one bigger question. What tax rate should we assume to be normal?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">At this point, 30% is a reasonable effective tax rate for the last two quarters of the year, realizing you need to add about 1.1 billion to that for the U.K. tax. And as we go into 2014 and 2015, that 30% migrates into more of a 32%, 33% effective tax rate based on what we think we will be earning as we go into \u201914 and \u201915.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And then secondly, the GWIM margin of 28%, I\u2019m just trying to compare that to the old Merrill Lynch wealth management margin, and you have the asset management and U.S. Trust in there. Can you just give us some estimate where that 28% margin would be? Would it be 26%? Or 25%?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Where it would be?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Excluding U.S. Trust and excluding asset management, in other words, just the pure brokerage business, what kind of margin did that have? I\u2019m trying to see if this is the highest brokerage margin ever, perhaps, if you can go back to the old Merrill Lynch.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">We don\u2019t disclose the difference. I think what you\u2019re asking is is the margin in U.S. Trust materially different than what it is in the traditional Merrill Lynch wealth management model. And you should not assume that the margin improvement and the 28% is driven by a mix. Virtually all of that margin is driven by overall what we\u2019re seeing in what you\u2019ve characterized as the traditional wealth management business of Merrill Lynch.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And then as far as net interest income, you said you had a $300 million benefit this quarter from the increase in the 10-year. So am I just doing the math right? You had $10.5 billion of net interest income, so it added 3% just this last quarter? Or really in the last month. It just seems like a lot. That\u2019s a nice benefit.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">If you flip to slide nine, we show both the reported as well as the actual number. And the reason why that increase in interest rates led to the improvement in NII is because you need to adjust the way you look at premium securities when rates go up to reflect the slowdown in the rate at which you\u2019d expect to be paid back. So that is more of a life of loan type adjustment, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s $300 million. It\u2019s the reason why we show you the number both ways.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And then lastly, the legal expense came way down. You expect to stay around $500 million. But I\u2019m still focused on the $8.5 billion settlement, and I go down to the courthouse in lower Manhattan, and what I think I hear - and again, correct my thinking - some lawyer say, that Bank of New York rubber stamped the $8.5 billion agreement, therefore throw the $8.5 billion deal out. And what I think the Kathy Patrick side say is, accept the $8.5 billion deal. It\u2019s the best economic alternative out there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">So my question is, you have $8.5 billion of reserves to the $8.5 billion settlement. Your disclosures say if the judge does not approve the deal, your reserves would go higher. So my question is, how much higher would your reserves go if the judge does not approve the deal, and what part of my logic would you like to perhaps correct?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">The first is we\u2019re not going to comment on the ins and the outs of the $8.5 billion, because as you know, technically we\u2019re not a part of that. The second thing as it relates to that that I would say is, and I think if you go back and look at one of the comments that was made, we accrued the $8.5 billion assuming that all 424 trusts were at the point where they got to the 25%, to where there was a negotiation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">So at this point, to comment whether or not we think the reserves would be higher or they could be lower is really not appropriate, because right now there\u2019s an $8.5 billion settlement that\u2019s going through the process. We\u2019ve accrued based on what 22 of the largest investors said was a fair deal, and as you know, when we set up the reserves, we applied that same methodology to a variety of our other exposures. And to speculate or to comment before then, given where we are in this, I just don\u2019t think is appropriate.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Sure. I think last quarter you thought it would all be wrapped up by now. Any sense of when this might be wrapped up, when you might have this behind you?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I\u2019m not sure that we ever said that we thought it would be wrapped up in the second quarter. What we do know is what you know now given how you\u2019ve followed the case. I believe there\u2019s a court schedule set up through the 26th of July. It\u2019s not clear whether or not it will be wrapped up by the 26th or it will go beyond that. And we\u2019ll just have to see how the process unfolds.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I believe at this point we\u2019re through all the questions, so thank you very much for joining us this morning, and we\u2019ll look forward to talking to you next quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Copyright policy: </strong>All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

Before Brian Moynihan and Bruce Thompson begin their comments, let me remind you that this presentation, which is available at bankofamerica.com does contain some forward-looking statements regarding both our financial condition and financial results, and that these statements involve certain risks that may cause actual results in the future to be different from our current expectations. Please see our press release and SEC documents for further information.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">So with that, let me turn it over to our CEO, Brian Moynihan.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thanks, Lee. Good morning, everyone. I will cover a few points and then I will turn it over to Bruce to go through the details of the quarter as we\u2019ve done in other quarters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Consistent with prior quarters, our Company continued to show progress on those areas we\u2019ve been focused upon. Capital generation, managing risk, achieving cost savings, addressing legacy issues and driving our core growth strategies in our core lines of business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">On the capital front this quarter, we generated $3 billion plus of Basel 1 Tier 1 common capital. Our Basel 3 ratio has now approached 10% on a fully phased-in basis. That capital and liquidity in the balance sheet optimization has been going on for the last several quarters, holds us in good shape with regards to the regulatory suggested or proposed requirements that we see on the horizon.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">The strength in capital is allowing us to return capital to shareholders. In the past six months we repurchased 140 million shares equaling about $2 billion of our $5 billion authorization.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Turning to the revenue side, we experienced relative stability this quarter. But of course we felt the impact of the industry wide headwinds on a slower refi business and mortgage and slowdown in the capital markets from a typical summer slowdown as well as the investor concerns of a political and monetary uncertainty.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">On expenses, this quarter we incurred additional litigation costs. Outside of that we continue to make progress on our expense initiatives, remaining on track to deliver the cost savings that we told you about two years ago in New BAC and also reducing the costs in our legacy assets and servicing area.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">In the credit area we continue to see asset quality improve and our net loss rates are at levels not seen since 2005. As the macro environment slowly improve, we experienced the 20% drop in net charge-offs and declining delinquencies from the second quarter. Our 248,000 teammates have been fully engaged with our customer clients to drive activity. We are pleased to see another quarter of solid loan growth in our commercial businesses while we continue to see the consumer lending activity stabilize in our card balances and modest growth elsewhere, which has offset the run off in a non-core portfolios.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">As a company, we reached record deposit levels this quarter, more than $1.1 trillion in deposit. Our client balance flows and our wealth management clients helped us maintain our industry leading positions. And you\u2019ve seen that Bank of America Merrill Lynch has assumed prominent roles in the marquee investment banking deals that have gone on this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We\u2019ve also seen a nice trend of progress, absent some seasonality, that results in our equity trading business. It\u2019s been gaining market share and continue to improve. So to sum it up, it\u2019s another solid quarter of progress in our core businesses and I\u2019m going to turn it over to Bruce to cover the -- in detail the presentation. Bruce?</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Thanks, Brian, and good morning everyone. I\u2019m going to start my presentation on slide 5. During the quarter we earned $2.5 billion or $0.20 per diluted share. Before I address the core business trends, let me mention a few noteworthy items from our results that we\u2019ve disclosed to you previously.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">First, we sold our remaining stake in CCB, recording a pre-tax gain of $753 million, which was partially offset by $443 million negative impact of FVO and DVA as our credit spreads continue to tighten during the quarter. The net of these items benefited EPS by $0.02 in the quarter. We also recorded a $1.1 billion charge to re-measure our U.K. deferred tax assets, given the 3% decline in the tax rate, which reduced EPS by $0.10 a share. The net of these is obviously a reduction of $0.08.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Moving to the core business, total revenues in the quarter on an FTE basis were solid at $21.7 billion or $22.2 billion if we exclude the FVO and DVA charges. If we compare this to the second quarter, revenues declined on lower mortgage banking revenue as well as mostly seasonal declines within our sales and trading area.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Total non-interest expense of $16.4 billion included 1.1 billion in litigation costs, $600 million increase in litigation costs from second quarter levels. The increase in these costs was partially offset by the improvement in both our legacy assets and servicing costs as well as the benefits of our New BAC initiatives. Asset quality improved significantly with net charge-offs improving 20% from the second quarter of 2013 to $1.7 billion and with the reserve reductions we took in the quarter, we recorded provision expense of just under $300 million in the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">On slide 6, you can see that our period end balance sheet remained relatively stable versus the prior quarter at about $2.13 billion. Customer activity remained solid with loans, largely led by commercial loans up $12.8 billion. Consumer lending activity in the quarter improved as we saw increased loan generation in our dealer financial services area and our continued stabilization of card balances which was partially offset by the run off within our home equity portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Period end deposits were up over $29 billion or 2.7%, led by commercial client activity and solid flows from our wealth management clients. If we move down the page, tangible book value per share improved to $13.62 and our tangible common equity ratio increased above 7%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Couple of other things that I like to mention, during the quarter we repurchased 60 million shares for roughly $900 million during the quarter. OCI increased by about $900 million during the quarter and our preferred stock includes the completion of our previously announced preferred stock redemption for just under $1 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">On slide 7, you can see our Basel 1 Tier 1 common ratio of 11.08%, increased 25 basis points from the second quarter of 2013. Under Basel 3 on a fully phased-in basis under the advanced approach, Tier 1 common capital increased by approximately $6 billion to an estimated $131.8 billion. Our Tier 1 common ratio is 9.94% showing a 34 basis point improvement from the second quarter of 2013.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In our estimate of the Basel 3 Tier 1 common ratio on a fully phased-in basis under the standardized approach would be just over 9% above our proposed 8.5% 2019 minimum requirement.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">If we move to the supplemental leverage ratio, based on the proposed U.S. requirements that don't take effect until 2018, at the end of the third quarter our bank holding company leverage ratio improved to above the proposed minimum of 5% and our two primary banking subsidiaries BANA and FIA continued to be in excess of the 6% proposed minimum.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">So to reiterate what Brian mentioned there are a lot of new capital regulations proposed or finalized and we already exceed the requirements for the various known rules on Basel 3 capital and the supplementary leverage ratio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On Slide 8, funding and liquidity, you can see our long-term debt end of the quarter $7 billion lower as maturities and the completion of our $5 billion tender offer outpaced issuances. We have $40 billion of parent company maturities through 2014 and as we look forward, we expect issuances to be materially below that number as we continue to reduce and smooth the maturity profile of our debt footprint.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Global excess liquidity sources of $359 billion increased from $342 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2013 and parent company liquidity remained strong at $95 billion. That translates into a time to required funding of 35 months well above our two-year coverage that we target.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">I would also like to highlight that on October 1 of this year, we completed the legal entity merger of the Merrill Lynch holding company into Bank of America Corporation as part of our continued efforts to both simplify the company and reduce costs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We turn to Slide 9, net interest income. Net interest income on a reported basis was $10.5 billion down from the second quarter of '13 as the improvement in our core net interest income was more than offset by negative impact from market-related impacts. If we exclude those market-related impacts, net interest income built off of Q2 '13's $10.4 billion to be just north of $10.5 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">During the quarter we benefited from higher rates in our discretionary book, lower long-term debt levels, higher commercial loans and lower rates paid on deposits. These positives were partially mitigated by lower loan yields and lower trading-related NII.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">As you'll note on this slide, the net interest yield excluding market-related impacts improved from 2.36% to 2.44% driven by the lower balance sheet levels as well as our lower funding costs. And consistent with what we mentioned last quarter, we expect to realize the benefit of higher long-term rates as we reinvest but note that some of those benefits will occur through time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On Slide 10, we'd spend a few minutes on expenses. Total expenses for the quarter were $16.4 billion, a $1.1 billion improvement from the year ago quarter but up $371 million from the second quarter of this year. I want to be clear as you look at expenses and see that the uptick in the linked quarter expense, we continue to deliver on our non-litigation expense reductions in our legacy assets and servicing area as well as the ongoing benefits from our New BAC initiatives in the balance of the company.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Compared with second quarter '13, progress on LAS and New BAC in addition to lower revenue-related incentive compensation was more than offset by increased costs of litigation as well as some marketing initiatives that were accelerated from the fourth quarter 2013.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Our litigation expenses did increase as they continued the valuation of legacy exposures led to an addition to reserves. Our LAS expenses ex-litigation which are shown on the grey bar on Slide 10 of $2.2 billion declined $110 million from the second quarter of '13 and we continue to expect our fourth quarter LAS expenses ex-litigation to be below $2 billion as we continue to make very good progress on reducing the number of 60 plus days delinquent that we have in that business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Our New BAC savings in the third quarter were approximately $100 million and are included in All Other, the red bar. We also remain on track to achieve the expected $1.5 billion of New BAC quarterly cost benefits by the end of 2013 and ultimately the $2 billion quarterly benefit upon completion of the project.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">From an employee staffing perspective, our number of FTEs ended the quarter at 248,000, a decline of more than 9000 or 3.6% from the second quarter of '13 and that was driven by staff reductions within our legacy assets and servicing area, declines in home loans given the slowdown in mortgage productions as well as the continued optimization of our branch network.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">And while we were down by 3.6% from the end of the second quarter to the end of the third quarter, the average LTEs only declined 2.3% so we'll get some additional benefits during the fourth quarter relative to the third from those reductions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We touched on asset quality, Slide 11. You can see that credit quality once again improved significantly. Net charge-offs declined to $1.7 billion, a 20% improvement on a linked-quarter basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As Brian referenced our third quarter of 2013 loss rate of 73 basis points declined 21 basis points from the second quarter and is now at 2005 levels. Delinquencies, a leading indicator of charge-offs, again declined nicely.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">During the quarter we did reduce reserves by $1.4 billion on the back of steadily improving consumer data which resulted in a provision expense of just under $300 million. Given what we see from the improving delinquencies as well as the current HPI trends absent any unexpected changes in the economy, we expect net charge-offs to decline again in the fourth quarter and stabilize sometime in 2014 at approximately $1.5 billion per quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Let's move into the individual lines of business on Slide 12. Our consumer and business banking segment we were very pleased with the results during the third quarter as we delivered improved earnings with revenues growing modestly and expenses declining from both the previous quarter as well as the year-ago quarter. This coupled with lower credit costs within the segment resulted in net income of approximately $1.8 billion during the quarter, a 28% improvement over the previous quarter and a 32% improvement over last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">That was achieved as we continued to do more business with our core customers. Our average deposits were stable as our organic customer growth was offset by some small branch divestitures as well as migrations to our Global Wealth and Investment Management area. Our brokerage assets are at record levels within this business, up 6% from the second quarter and up 18% over the prior-year\u2019s quarter. Average loans as I mentioned reflect stability in card balances as well as growth within our dealer financial services area. Card issuance during the quarter remained strong.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We issued more than one million new cards in the third quarter which is at the highest level going back to 2008. Consistent with our relationship strategy, 63% of this issuance was to people that we have existing relationships with, and credit quality continues to be strong as delinquencies and net losses continued to improve during the quarter. Reduced expense levels in the segment reflects the benefits of our network optimization partially offset by investments we continue to make as we build out our specialist sales force in this area.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On Slide 13, commercial real estate services where we operate the production, origination and servicing of consumer real estate loans. In our supplemental information we report the two separate components of this segment, one focused on loan origination and the other focused on servicing and legacy issues. On originations this quarter, first mortgage retail originations were $22.6 billion which was down 11% from the prior quarter and up 11% compared with originations in the year ago period. We believe that the current period decline in production is less than our industry peers as we have been working through our existing pipeline.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Our current pipeline at the end of the third quarter is however down approximately 60% compared to the end of the second quarter of \u201913 which reflects the significant reduction in market demand particularly in the refinancing space. Since our production revenue is booked at the point in which you lock alone is opposed to funding, I should point out that our lock volume was down 23% from the second quarter of 2013. In addition to those lower lock volumes, we saw a gain on sale margins decline compared to the second quarter of 2013; our reduction was about 60 basis points during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">As a result of all these factors, core production revenue was down 46% to $465 million from the second quarter of 2013. From a staffing point of view just on the origination side as we saw demand slow we reduced headcounts by more than 1000 employees towards the end of the quarter. We will continue to reduce these staffing levels to be consistent with the lower volumes that we\u2019ve seen. The other primary component in this segment servicing revenue declined approximately $100 million versus the second quarter as our servicing portfolio declined as we continued to complete certain servicing transfers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">The other item that I want to highlight on this slide that\u2019s particularly important is the servicing cost that we see within the legacy assets and servicing area. We\u2019ve spoken a lot about reducing the number of 60 plus day delinquencies in this portfolio and we had a lot of success during the quarter as the number of 60 plus day delinquent loans dropped below 400,000 units at the end of September nearly a 100,000 lower than what we had at the end of June. Roughly half of the decline was driven by the transfers of servicing that I referenced in conjunction with the MSR sales agreements that we announced in the first quarter of 2013. And once again, as a result of this work we continue to believe that our LAS expenses ex-litigation will be below $2 billion during the fourth quarter of 2013.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On slide 14, our global wealth and investment management area had another strong quarter generating solid earnings and solid returns. Within this segment both Merrill Lynch and U.S. Trust maintained their leadership positions with a total of $2.3 trillion of client balances. Revenue remains near record high at $4.4 billion up 8% over the third quarter of 2012. Relative to the third quarter of 2012 net income improved 26% and with the third consecutive quarter in which our pre-tax margin was above 25%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Asset management fees achieved the new record during the quarter while our brokerage income did decline from the second quarter due to reduced market activity. Client engagement remains quite strong, long-term AUM flows were $10.3 billion near doubling last year\u2019s production. Ending deposits were up $6.5 billion or roughly 3% from the prior quarter, and our ending client loan balances of $117.2 billion reached record levels and are up 2% from the second quarter of \u201913 and 11% over the third quarter of a year ago as we continue to provide more banking products to both our Merrill Lynch and U.S. Trust clients.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On Slide 15, you can see global banking earnings were stable relative to the year ago period. Revenue compared to a year ago includes the benefit of strong loan growth and stable investment banking fees. Expenses this quarter include very good cost controls offset slightly by elevated litigation expense. Global fee pools did decline but we maintained our strong second place ranking of global net investment banking fees recording $1.3 billion of fees in improving our market share to 7.7%. In addition if you look at fees within the Americas we ranked number one within 11% market share.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">During 2013 we have advised on 7 of the top 15 announced M&amp;A deals. As we head into the last quarter of the year, the pipeline looks quite strong but I do want to highlight that during the fourth quarter of last year we did see record levels of debt issuance during that period. If you look at the balance sheet, average loans increased $4.4 billion from the second quarter with more than half of that growth driven by commercial real estate lending with the balance by C&amp;I lending particularly with our large corporate clients. Average deposits increased $12.2 billion from the second quarter of \u201913 above our expectations given certain timing consideration as well as customer liquidity that\u2019s been built around the fiscal cliff concerns.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">If we move to Slide 16, global markets; we earned $531 million during the quarter after excluding the $1.1 billion U.K. tax charge as well as DVA losses of $291 million. On a comparable basis this is a decrease of $341 million compared to the third quarter of 2012 and down $403 million from the second quarter of \u201913 due to lower sales and trading revenue as well as higher expense from litigation. Sales and trading revenue ex-DVA was $3 billion during the quarter an 8% decline from the comparable year ago period. Fixed sales and trading revenue was down 20% versus the year ago period once again impacted by concerns regarding the present decision out of stimulus program as well as political uncertainty both domestically in abroad.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Our equity sales and trading area had another very strong quarter with revenues ex-DVA up 36% over the year ago period as we experienced higher market volumes and continued to benefit from the repositioning of this business that\u2019s happened over the last 18 months. We are gaining market share and we\u2019re improving our performance in each of the product lines. Expenses in the quarter compared to the third quarter of \u201912 included higher litigation costs that were partially offset by a reduction in operating expenses. Average trading related assets were down 4% from the year ago period while our VaR was effectively flat.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On Slide 17, we show you the results of all other. Gains on the sale of debt securities were $347 million in the third quarter down $105 million from the second quarter of '13. You can also see the breakout of $1.1 billion of equity investment income which reflects the CCB gains, as I mentioned earlier, as well as an additional $368 million of gains. The FPO that I mentioned earlier is also recorded in this segment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Expenses include roughly $350 million during this quarter for litigation. That compares to $100 million in the second quarter of '13 and $950 million in the third quarter of 2012. As we close on All Other, I would note that the effective tax rate for the quarter ex the impact of the U.K. tax reduction charge was 25% and as we look forward to the fourth quarter of 2013, we expect the effective rate to be in the high 20s.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Before we take questions, I'd like to leave you with several thoughts about our results. Capital and liquidity both strengthened during the quarter. We had encouraging business results as we saw improvement in both activity and profitability within Consumer and Business Banking. We saw continued strength in Global Wealth Management. We maintained our top position in investment banking and had another quarter of strong growth in our equity sales and trading business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Credit continued to improve. Our cost initiative work remains on track and to the extent of the steepened yield curve environment stays with us, it should allow us to move NII upward as we move forward. We'll continue to execute on our strategy and continue to deliver on the earnings power of the company.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">With that, we'll go ahead and open it up for questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p6\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">(Operator Instructions). We'll first go to the site of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Great, thanks. In addition the slides have got a good breakdown of the rep and warrant reserving. Could you talk a little bit about the litigation and how to think about the litigation costs as we go forward because that's obviously still volatile, maybe discuss what's still remaining that could get kind of roped into that as we go forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Yes. Moshe, what I'll say is that if you look as we referenced, it was roughly 1.6 billion a year ago, it was 500 in the second quarter and it was roughly 1 billion this quarter. I'd go back to and I think we've been pretty consistent, if you go back to 2010 and look at the build over the course of four years from both the litigation and rep and warrant perspective, I think you can see that we have more of that over the course of a 3.5-year period than anyone else out there. And as we look at the remaining pipeline, we put it in really four different buckets. The first is the GSE bucket for rep and warrant which with one exception we've got global settlements from the end of '08 back with Freddie and Fannie. So as we look at that bucket, we feel very good about that. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">We then go to the second bucket which is monolines. We've got global settlements with three of the five monolines and we've established the reserves for the remaining two based on that history of the three. We then go to the rep and warrant with respect to the private-label securities, the 8.5 billion Gibbs &amp; Bruns case which represents half the exposure continues to go through the core process and they'll be back in court on that I believe in November. And obviously we set up reserves at that point based on the Gibbs &amp; Bruns history and as we've said before for that which we didn't have the basis to establish a reserve, we put out a range of possible loss for rep and warrant that continues to be up to $4 billion. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And then you move into the other piece that we have that's the RMBS securities litigation. During the quarter, the Luther-Maine settlement received preliminary approval during the quarter and we'll look to get final approval by that sometime during the fourth quarter and we obviously set up a reserve in that settlement, it was for $500 million which represents in the zip code of 65% to 70% of the company-wide exposure that we have for RMBS litigation. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And then the other two pieces that we continue to work through in that bucket are the FHFA litigation on behalf of Freddie and Fannie as well as AIG and there's really nothing to report new on either those fronts. And what you saw during the quarter as we said was really an adjustment to the reserves based on as we get more information into the extent that there are additional discussions with some of the people that we're in a party with those discussions still.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">I guess just to follow-up on that because JPMorgan had indicated that they had expenses in this quarter that were substantially higher than what they would have anticipated as possible even three months ago because of the change in the regulatory environment do you feel like you've taken that fully into account?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Yes, let me be a little bit more specific when we go back to because I think the one thing that's been overlooked a little bit and this is not a number we're particularly pleased with, but if you go back to the beginning of 2010 and look at the combined litigation of rep and warrant expense that we've had in this company, it's been over $40 billion which I think is quite a bit higher than the number that they've quoted. Obviously those numbers are particular to each institution but I think as you look at what we've tried to do that those numbers have been significant and I think at this point relative to our peers, we've tried to be out front and get through some of the larger settlements that we have and we think that $40 billion plus number reflects that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Just shifting gears on the mortgage business, you had a decline in rate locks that you identified but the pipeline actually is down substantially more. Just talk a little bit about how you see the fourth quarter and into 2014 because you've got both the potential for obviously a further decline and as that pipeline kind of moves through, but then again you also had a fairly high rep and warrant in the quarter. How should we think about that from a revenue perspective?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Let's talk about the production first. You remember that we had a lot of HAMP going on and that's been dropping each quarter as we sort of get through the volumes of that and that had a pretty good impact. It was down roughly 3.5 billion or so linked quarter. The rest of production continues to move forward. But if you look at what's really going on as we speak because during the third quarter you have significant changes in July, August as we ran through the pipeline, et cetera. The current pipeline stands at a level 30,000 odd. The current application volumes today are around 1,000. The purchased piece of that has maintained relatively constant 300-ish a day. So if you think about that, we had sort of a month and a half of pipeline and that's been pretty consistent as we got into September and through October. So it kind of extrapolates that out. You should see production levels that would be down again in the fourth quarter, but will start to mitigate. The issue on the revenues as spreads have come in and the refinancing volume is at a higher profit margin because the work is not as much. And so we expect to see a lot like we're seeing now, spreads that come in a couple hundred basis points or so, and we expect that to hold and the volumes will come down. And so I think the number will continue to work in that direction. What you do mention is the other side which is sort of the rep and warrant exposure and stuff that goes through there, stuff that changes and Bruce can touch on that. But in terms of overall volumes we're starting to take the people down to max the volumes. You remember we had a lot of work to do here. If you look at our non-HAMP production, it's continued to grow each quarter. Our home equity loan production has doubled in the last few quarters and we'll continue to drive that forward. As we told you many times it will never be a huge business for this company because it's a business which is very competitive out there and the profit margins will always be thin, but we need to do it for our customers and clients.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And on the rep and warrant front, you're right. The rep and warrant expense was just over $300 million a quarter and we clearly would expect that the run rate of that expense is going to be much more in the $150 million quarter type run rate as opposed to the $300 million plus.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Got it. The very last one from me is as you had mentioned the expected improvement in charge-offs, the provision obviously was substantially low. How should we think about the provision relative to those charge-offs in Q4 and into '14?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yes, I think once again our comments will be assuming that we don't see any slippage in the economy. During the quarter if you look at the reserve release, roughly 250 of it was from a purchase credit impaired and roughly a 1.150 billion from the core. As we go forward, I would think about the reserve release much more consistent with what you saw on the first and second quarters of this year over the next couple of quarters, and that ultimately as we get into that latter part of \u201914 and beyond you\u2019d expect most of that to go away, but I do think there are probably another couple of quarters where it could be in line with what we saw on the first and second quarter, but clearly not at the third quarter of this year given the sharp improvement in credit we saw.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Great. Thanks. Thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">We\u2019ll now go to the side of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hi, good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Good morning, Betsy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Just one follow-up on the conversation we just had regarding the reps and warranties and litigation, so I heard you that the monoline three out of five are done, you established reserves for the other two based on the three out of five; is that part of the rep and warranty this quarter? Is establishing reserves for the other two based on the three out of five done?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">No, it is not.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. And then on the litigation reserve, I mean we\u2019ve seen obviously a long list of stuff in your Q, so it is fair to say that litigation reserve was just all of the above of that long list or was there something specific that you saw in the quarter that drove the higher number. I\u2019m just wondering, do we do the billion quarterly in our model going forward or is it going to be more episodic than that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">But I think as we\u2019ve said that number tends to be lumpy. And I wouldn\u2019t say that there was any one specific item during the quarter that you could point to. It was really just a continued evaluation of the reserves as well \u2013as well as reflective of any current discussions that we\u2019re having with the different parties that we\u2019re trying to work through this with.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. And then on the LAS expenses you indicated that next quarter sub $2 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">That\u2019s correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. And so you highlighted that your delinquents are down half from the asset sales and half from your own actions. So, is it fair to say that the reduction, roughly $300 million or so, well $200 million to $300 million or so that you\u2019re calling out for next quarter is also equally half and half, and part of the question is trying to understand, you know the run rate of how those expenses are coming out associated with the asset sale and I\u2019m wondering is that front end loaded in 4Q, is that going to be 4Q through 2Q next year and are the organic actions you\u2019re taking likely that\u2019ll be equivalent size in terms of the decline in the LAS expenses?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yeah, I think and I would say a couple of things on that too, Betsy -- once again the, we told you at the end of the second quarter that we would get the number of 60 plus day units down below 375,000 units by the end of the year. And you can see during the third quarter alone we got them down below 400,000. So we feel particularly good with that guidance. There\u2019s a lot of work that goes on in a quarter to move out and to get the servicing transfers done as it relates to both our own teammates as well as people that we use to help us with that. So that\u2019s why you saw some of the numbers Q2 to Q3 a little bit sticky. But the point that you raised, I think is the right one which is now that you\u2019ve got the loans out you have the ability to take the expense out and that\u2019s why we would expect the expense reduction in the fourth quarter to be greater than what we\u2019ve seen in the third quarter. And I think as you look out at and as you look through 2014 the guidance that we\u2019ve given is very -- really remains the same and you can feel more comfortable with given the delinquencies that as you go through 2014, you should see that expense number go from below $2 billion in the fourth quarter of \u201913 to below $1 billion by the end of \u201914 and it always can be a little bit lumpy, but you should see that occur generally consistently throughout the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay, thanks. And then lastly on page 7, you highlight the regulatory capital. Obviously it seems like you have set yourself up well for a bigger ask in CCAR from a buyback perspective, is that a fair assumption to make. And could you highlight how SLR factors into that, and are your SLR numbers that you present fully loaded in 3Q or is it on a phase end approach?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yeah, our SLR numbers are fully loaded at both the bank holding company as well as at the subs. And as we look at CCAR what I would say is, we\u2019ve been consistent on this that we\u2019ve done and done everything we can both in the way intrinsically, the way we run the company which in many respects is not in consistent with what you get tested in CCAR net. But built our Basel 1.5 ratio up significantly from last year. The Basel 3 ratio is across the board or up. As you look at both credit risk and market risk those have obviously gotten better and we\u2019ve continued to put the legacy issues behind us. So as we look at, we obviously we\u2019re able to return $5 billion to the common shareholders during this year is part of the CCAR process and we\u2019ll look to move forward from that realizing that and until we see the exact case that we\u2019re running and what the test is. I think it's probably premature to say anything more than this.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. Thanks a lot.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And we\u2019ll next go to the side of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is now open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Hi, good morning. Bruce I was wondering on the net interest income side, do you think that the core NII should kind of grind higher at a similar pace that we saw this quarter, it looks like it was up $100 million assuming no big change in rates?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I think that\u2019s fair John and there\u2019s -- you always thought a little bit subject to mix loan pricing as well as rate environment but that\u2019s clearly the trajectory that we\u2019re on. So the answer would be, yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And how should we think about the market sensitive component; do you still have the NII hedges on or is it really the FAS 91 that adds volatility from here?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yeah, I think it's important and the one thing that doesn\u2019t come out when you look at this slide is it's not that we saw much variability in either FAS 91 or hedging effectiveness during the third quarter. It was that we had some benefits in the second quarter when you had the sharp increase in rates. So, as long as you\u2019re within a reasonable range where rates aren\u2019t bouncing around, you shouldn\u2019t see much of that but keep in mind that what you saw on the first and second quarters was because of the largely unprecedented movement up in rates that we saw that gave us the FAS 91 benefit.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. And over time does that FAS 91 effect, dissipate over time or is it always going to be with you?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Well it gets reset so that you don\u2019t have any aberration from quarter-to-quarter, and the only time you have an aberration on a run rate basis is when the underlying rates move.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. And then any update on your rate sensitivity relative to where you stood at the end of last quarter for a 100 basis point move in long rates?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yeah, I think \u2013 I want to think we\u2019re in the same zip code both on a 100 basis point steepening as well as a 100 basis point parallel shift in the guidance that we\u2019ve given once it takes us about three years to earn back any impact in OCI and we\u2019re a touch better than that this quarter. And if you look at the supplemental you\u2019ll see that, the level of debt securities is down modestly as we\u2019re very sensitive to managing that OCI risk.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. And then just a follow up on litigation expense. Back in July you were thinking perhaps $500 million per quarter and clearly it came in much higher than at this quarter and, I recognize things are fluid here. But should we be thinking of litigation expense more or like this quarter or more or like last, are you able to say?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yeah, John that\u2019s really difficult to say. I think that the punch line is, is that it can be lumpy and we obviously do and work hard each quarter to the extent that we can get things put behind us at reasonable levels for the shareholders, we do that. It is an evolving process and it's something that we\u2019re working hard on and at the same time there\u2019s no question that the expense was elevated this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. And then one more clarification on the core expenses; how much did the expenses come down for mortgage so far and what do you see left on that, and then just any comment on the IB comp ratio, how we should think about that going forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Sure. I am not sure I understand your question on the mortgage expense \u2026</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yeah, any capacity reduction that you\u2019re doing as originations come down. Have you gotten the benefit from that and how much might we expect for you to do that going forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">No, as we referenced on the front end, so on the legacy piece we talked about the Q3 going to Q2 and how we\u2019ll have that below two. As we talked about we needed to get through the pipeline on the front end during the third quarter which we did. The 1000 people that we referenced on the front end happened late in the quarter. And as I mentioned we're going to continue to reduce that to, to size that for the volumes that we're seeing now but we've not put out a specific number on that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. And in terms of IB comp what we saw this quarter and how we should think about that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes, we typically \u2013 if you look at combined investment banking and sales and trading you tend to be in the mid to high 30s and I don't think you're going to see any significant variations in that Q3 to Q4.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay, thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">John, one thing on both in the mortgage and otherwise, as Bruce talked about, the actions we've taken during the quarter to reduce headcount overall in the company, a lot of it is in the second half of the quarter so you always get a continuing on effect of that. And by the way next quarter as we reduce further LAS and mortgage, you'll see it go in the first quarter. So it doesn't lag and it's just the nature of severance accruals you take at the time plus as we move the headcount out, sort of paying them on as you go on the severance also in certain cases. So you should expect that those volume-related reductions will continue to move forward and the economics of what we did in the third quarter is probably more in the fourth quarter than it is in the third quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Got it. Okay, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We will next go to the site of Glenn Schorr with ISI. Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI Group</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Thank you. A question on SIC, I think the explanation on the down 20% was fair enough and a lot of macro and political reasons which I get. Just curious on if you had any early comments on swaps execution and clearing impact in the quarter and what do you see going forward as clients migrate?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I wouldn't really know any specific change there, Glenn. It's something that we continue to look at. The one thing I'd say that we are working hard on and this really flips more to some of the capital in central clearing type things that as we continue to have more and more of that migrated, that is going to benefit certain capital ratios as we look at counterparty. So I think that the ongoing to the extent that there is economic negative going forward, we're obviously continuing to spend a lot of time with that. But the one piece that is a little bit more tangible that we work through is that there will be some decent benefits over the course of 12 to 18 months as more and more of that gets migrated.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. As you think about the markets business, one of the things that Tom and team have done is got the \u2013 we've talked about in various quarters, he's kept the breakeven point relatively low. So in a quarter which the equities business was very good for us comparatively, but the fixed income business which is a lot bigger than the equity business was obviously down, we still made $0.5 billion. And so the goal there is to be able to serve our client and customers while keep the balance sheet in good shape and also keep the expense base so that when we get $2.5 million to $3 million we start making some decent money. And in a good quarter we'll make a good amount of money and Tom and team have done a good job to keep that expense base in line and mostly expense increase here is with litigation and things that were non-fundamental to show up in this line of business related to the broader question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI Group</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I appreciate that. I might be putting words in your mouth but it sounds like that you have pretty good operating leverage build in on the upside then. In other words it doesn't necessarily scale up and down with revenues to the same degree?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes, if you just look across the last four quarters you see it but the key was going from '11 and '12 we moved the fundamental level so there is good operating leverage. You get another 1 billion in revenues. A lot of it comes through net of an incremental compensation care.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI Group</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. One other question just on cards. It looks like issuance and balances have been grown good. I'm just curious how much of that as you are turning up the heat on marketing, selling to the branches and how you feel about the outlook because it's been a while since we saw the industry in general have decent balance growth?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes. I think a couple of things in there just kind to reiterate a little bit we touched on is that we may over the course of the last 12 to 18 months the investment of having more bankers in the branches and trying to do more things with our customers. And I'd say the two things that we feel best about as you look at that growth in cards to over 1 million cards in the quarter is the first is that 63% of those people once again we already have an existing relationship with and obviously know something about and are trying to do more with. And the second thing I'd say is that as you look at the overall FICO and credit volume of those borrowers, they tend to be in the mid 700s on average. So it's the right customer, it's sold the right way and it's part of an overall deepening strategy. And now that we're starting to see some of the balances creep up, it's reflective of that activity which I think quite frankly overshadows a little bit as we cleaned out some of the affinity and other programs that the new stuff that you saw got overshadowed by thinks that were legally in the books but now that we're largely through that, what we're doing on the front end is starting to come out.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI Group</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay, perfect. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">We will next go to the site of Derek De Vries with UBS. Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Derek De Vries - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I just have a detailed question on the OCI. There was a 1.4 billion gain I think from pension \u2013 changes in pension. Can you just explain what that was about?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Sure. What happens is that typically you mark your pension OCI once a year as you update the asset values and assumptions at year end. You typically do that on an annual basis. Because we merged several pension plans at the end of August, we will require to re-measure those assets as of the end of August and that $1.4 billion reflects that the change in value from Jan 1 to August 31 and then obviously we'll re-measure those again at year end.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Derek De Vries - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">That's great. Thanks. Then talking more generally, I mean you obviously have a lot of corporate relationships and I guess there was some unease about what's going on in Washington, but assuming we can get through that, do you get the sense that the corporate you're looking has kind of moved from margin preservation to investment or are they just really worried about the macro environment? I'm trying to get a sense of loan growth going forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes. I think if you look at our client base which ranges from small businesses through largest companies in the world, I'd say all of them feel very good about their operating position making money. Have done a tremendous job of keeping the cost structure in line. An example with a company that had 200 employees whose sales are going to go by 25% and they said, we're only going to add five employees. So the American business has gotten very efficient. But when you put on top of them the uncertainties because we're all engaged in global commerce, the macro uncertainties at the world level, the U.S. level, I think there has been an uncertainty in the whole back here that will come through as more and more clarity both economy, i.e. final demands of the products and the macro situation comes clear. And so is the sprint out of the blocks? No, they're running forward and it would probably be a speed up of the process. And you saw some of that this summer with some of the M&amp;A activity and stuff in the larger companies has strengthened and you're seeing it go on. So I think there's demand in the system so to speak. There's money on the sidelines from investor side and the more clarity you'll see better activity. Meanwhile underneath it you see the core economy continue to push forward even with all things going on around the world.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Derek De Vries - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">That's very helpful. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">We will now go to the site of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>James Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Hi. Good morning. Can you talk, run me through the expense line a little bit on the compensation side? I guess I'm just struggling a little bit with on a year-over-year basis you guys were down around 1 million on the comp line but headcount stay on 25,000 employees; capital markets, revenues are down. Why are we seeing that still elevated and how do we see that go down more significantly going forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Sure. We have a couple of things going on. First I'll tell you that the expense number during the third quarter of last year and I'm going to speak to if you flip to Slide 10 for a moment that if you look at that comp or the All Other bucket which is I think what you're referring to, that $13 billion in the third quarter last year was particularly low if you look out where it was in the fourth quarter, it was at $13.4 billion. So that can bounce around by a couple hundred million dollars. So realized, it was off a low base. You did see a couple of things in the third quarter this year that you wouldn't have had. The first is that the Wealth Management revenues which there's a fair bit of formulaic compensation are running at, as I mentioned, at higher levels in '13 and '12, so you have some compensation there. The second thing that you had this quarter, as Brian referenced, as we took down headcount we had roughly $100 million of severance that came through the P&amp;L during the quarter. The third thing that you had during the quarter as I referenced you had some elevated marketing expense that will go down in the fourth quarter that you also didn\u2019t have in the third quarter. So a combination of a variety of items, but I think what we would say is that as you look to go forward, you should see that red bar come down based on our overall expense initiatives as well as New BAC.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And remember also that when we give these reduction numbers we\u2019re not giving you a reduction and saying, but then we\u2019re going else with this is a net number that you pointed out. So all the investments we are making in the third quarter last year with third quarter this year you\u2019ve seen that the mortgage production cost go up, which will come back down. But all the investment we made, sales people do the cards that we talked about earlier, small business lending, investment services you can see at the branch level, you can see the numbers growing there, all those are in those numbers. So all those investments are more commercial bankers that are helping our commercial loan growth in the (indiscernible) then you have the natural salary increases and stuff like that are all absorbed in that and you have to nominal numbers are flat and frankly if you back out a couple of things that Bruce just mentioned are down and so we\u2019re comfortable on course for New BAC. But remember these numbers are absorbing all the usual costs that we do plus the investments in business which we\u2019re making strong investments in the areas we have growth opportunity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>James Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. Now that\u2019s helpful on the severance and I guess I would assume that we\u2019d see some less of that going forward given the significant reductions in mortgage this quarter right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">That\u2019s correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>James Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay, great. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Operator</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And we will next go to Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank North America</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Hi guys.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Matt how are you?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank North America</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Just as we think about the overall size of the balance sheet, you mentioned managing the securities book with OTI risk in mind and obviously the securities that come down as you mentioned this quarter while the loans are growing, how do we think about the net impact of this to, I guess, looking out the next several quarters?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">As far as just notional side of the balance sheet?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank North America</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yes and I\u2019m really focused on the loans plus the securities, because obviously liquidity levels can vary quarter-to-quarter and the trading books can vary quarter-to-quarter. So just -- I mean loans are growing nicely, but it's being offset by security is coming down. So I\u2019m really just focused on those two components.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yes. I think at this point, what I would expect is that generally speaking the securities book should remain relatively consistent with where it is and then if you look at the loan book, I would say that you are going to see that the loan book as well as well as the shrinkage of the debt footprint will be absorbed through deposit growth as well as a reduction to some extent in our parent company liquidity as we are carrying an elevated level of parent company liquidity to address these significant debt maturities in 2014 and the net of those which I thought you\u2019re getting to initially is that you should continue to see this balance sheet in the 2.125 to 2.25 type area, but as we go forward we should continue to get it to be more and more efficient.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yes, I think one thing that we haven't -- we don\u2019t -- haven\u2019t talked about in a while is we still have a significant run off portfolios that we\u2019re replacing as to which gives us ability to grow the core business without growing the balance sheet footings and I think that\u2019s something that will help us in our capital levels that are already very strong today going forward because effectively we don\u2019t need the incremental capital to grow the balance sheet even that have commercial loan growth and other types of growth you're talking.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank North America</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Great. So, flattish balance sheet, but optimizing the capital usage and then obviously the NIM probably benefiting from the remix there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yes and by the way everything is on the NIM is still the short rate move drives a lot of profit because the deposit franchise is an advantage to funding source as you all know.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank North America</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And then just separately circling back on the kind of core expenses that's $13.1 billion, I guess its $13 billion extra severance and there is some of the mortgage staff reduction, still some New BAC coming in and maybe some investments. I mean, where is that on the revenue base that you\u2019ve right now, where is that $13.1 billion go to if you just fully loaded all the stuff that you can see?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I think the best guidance that we give at this point is we\u2019ve got roughly 600 million a quarter in New BAC to get done over the next five to six quarters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank North America</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. That's a net number. So to think about it 12.4 to 12.5?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yes, but you have got to remember you've got to add back some of LAS costs -- with the subtracts in there, but there is always -- LAS is a servicing business, it always had some cost that we probably took.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank North America</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yes, I guess I was just breaking the \u2013 you got the litigation which is the moving target, you got the LAS which had been pretty explicit and then everything else is 13.1 that \u2026?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yes that -- sometimes people take that lower number [multi] times, but you\u2019ve got to remember -- parts of other costs will also be in there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank North America</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yes. Okay, thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And we will go next to the side of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">My questions have been answered. Thanks. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And we will now go to Mike Mayo with CLSA. Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Michael Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Hi. I just wanted to clarify the New BAC benefits. So how much of New BAC have you achieved?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Roughly 1.4 billion a quarter Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Michael Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Relative 2 billion a quarter that we\u2019ve previously announced.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Michael Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And originally I thought you\u2019re looking for mid 2015, so when you say 600 million more that\u2019s what you mean when you say over six or so quarters?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">That\u2019s correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Michael Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And just to clarify the last answer, so you expect all that to hit the bottom line or some of that will be offset by investments in sales people and other investments?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I think what we said was at the current run rate level you should be expecting that to hit the bottom line.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Michael Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. Switching back to the legal questions, you said you had taken over $40 billion of charges. What is your legal reserve as of the end of the third quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">We did not put out a litigation reserve on a standalone basis. The number that we do put out is where we are in rep and warrant and that was just over $14 billion at the end of the third quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Michael Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">14 billion in rep and warrant?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">That\u2019s correct. 14.1 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Michael Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. And would that include anything other than the $8.5 billion settlement?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">That includes another 5.5 for a variety of matters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Michael Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So for the Gibbs &amp; Bruns settlement you have an $8.5 billion reserve for that settlement. I think I asked this on some other earnings calls, but if that agreement was not approved by the judge, what is the potential range for that $8.5 billion reserve?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">As we have said before, we would need to look at that based on the circumstances that come out at the time and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a foregone conclusion, it goes one way or the other.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Michael Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. Switching gears in terms of loan growth, what\u2019s the loan utilization level? And what are you seeing as far as acceleration or deceleration in loan growth?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I would say that -- we really haven\u2019t -- and one of the things that we try to do and we\u2019ll continue to optimize particularly the way that the Basel 3 standardized ratio works that focus more and more in for those places where we make credit commitments to have the loans be funded as opposed to unfunded given the capital treatment that's out there. So, I would say generally as you look at line utilizations, there hasn\u2019t been much that\u2019s changed at all the -- where you\u2019re seeing the loan growth has been more funded type loan growth in many cases for a large high quality companies that are making acquisitions, a couple that we\u2019d have seen this quarter would have been Verizon Wireless as well as Amgen.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Mike -- overall Mike the loan utilization rates, they haven\u2019t moved around a lot, but they\u2019re at low levels historically across the board whether it\u2019s our business banking segment, the middle market segment and the large corporate not -- don't really use their lines other than as Bruce described and they\u2019re doing something inorganic, but they\u2019re very low which gives you two things. One it indicates that they have got lots of cash and have lots of room for investment, but secondly as the economy picks up moving back with thousand basis points or so we are from sort of more normal levels like a better term is a lot loan growth within -- without new customer relationships, or any more work.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Michael Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I understand you\u2019re picking and choosing your spots more. So would you say that demand really hasn\u2019t changed a whole lot over the past year or two or is it picking up in certain areas?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I think demand has picked up over the last couple of year. I think that the company have a line of credit in their dynamics. They are using it a lower level than they did not necessary two years ago, but during the normal economic times and that\u2019s the second point the demand has been picking up across the consumer demand and things like that, but it's still not as strong as it would be because it's a 2% growth rate economy out there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Michael Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">All right. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">We will take our final question from the site of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Your line is now open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Good morning. I just have a few cleanup sort of questions. With respect to the long-term debt footprint then, have you talked about how much of the 40 billion that is coming due that you would expect to refi, or are you going to let it all just go?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">It won't all just go, but I think it's safe to assume that less than half of it will be refinanced.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay, thanks. That's helpful. On the last question you were asked about the litigation reserve which understandably you don't want to go there, but do you have an estimate of what your reasonable and possible beyond those litigation reserve will be this quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yes, I believe, Guy, that \u2013 at the end of the second quarter, I believe that we had said that the range of possible loss with respect to litigation was in the high-2s and we'll obviously need to freshen that up as we get the third quarter Q out. But I wouldn't expect to see anything significant one way or the other.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Got it. The 1.1 billion litigation expense and I guess reserve build this quarter, can you give us a sense of how it breaks down by business unit, because it didn't seem like it all goes to All Other?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yes, if you look at by business unit, I referenced that as you flowed through that you had \u2013 and you can see it in the commercial real estate services area, the results were 300 million of it there. There was roughly 300 of it between banking and markets and then the majority \u2013 the rest of it was in All Other.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Great. That's helpful. You mentioned that you had accelerated some marketing initiatives from the fourth quarter to the third and I was just wondering if you could just give us a little color on specifically what they were since everybody is looking for growth?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Yes, I think only two things is that you've obviously seen a little bit more brand that's out there and then with CCP there was the acceleration of what we do from a charitable perspective from the fourth to the third, those were the two items.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Got it. And then the very final question is you had meaningful improvement in your Basel 3 capital above and beyond the earnings and it looks like it's a pretty meaningful reduction in the threshold and other deductions. I was wondering if you could just give us a little bit more granularity on what was going on there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">It's a great question. And really two things going on. Keep in mind as we've said because we have a decent chunk disallowed DTA from a Basel perspective that ballpark we will accrete capital on a pretax basis generally speaking as opposed to a post tax basis for a decent number of quarters going forward. So when you look at that, I think pretax not so much post tax. And then the second benefit that you had which was an earlier question was the benefit of OCI during the quarter of roughly $1 billion after-tax or $1.5 billion pretax and that was the combination of the pension to the positive and then to the negative CCP coming out as well as some of the debt securities gains.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Got it. Okay, that's great. Thanks so much for taking my questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Thank you. Okay, I think that's all the questions that we have. So thanks for joining us this morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">This does conclude today's program.

[Operator instructions.] It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Lee McEntire. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Lee McEntire</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning, everybody on the phone as well as the webcast. Thanks for joining us this morning. Before I turn the call over to Brian and Bruce, let me remind you we make forward-looking statements today. For further information on those, please refer to the website and our SEC filings about our forward looking statement information.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">So without further ado, let me turn it over to Brian, our CEO.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thanks, Lee, and good morning to all of you, and thank you for joining us to review our fourth quarter results. As we talked about over the last several quarters, we\u2019ve been on a journey to simplify our company, and we\u2019ve talked to you about our some consistent areas of focus: capital generation, reducing our costs, managing the risk down, addressing the legacy issues, and driving business growth overall.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Each quarter, you have seen the progress our teammates have made and the momentum is becoming more evident. On the first page, slide two of the deck, you can see the annual comparisons that will show you the progress over the last couple of years. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">First, we\u2019ve improved the balance sheet. Our tier one common capital has grown 16% this year, liquidity and time to required funding have further strengthened. The strength in capital and liquidity allowed us to begin returning capital through share buybacks to shareholders in 2013.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Another area of our early focus has been rightsizing our expense base. We have been meeting the goals of our cost programs each year. While we\u2019ve made progress on those each quarter, there is still significant progress when you look over the last couple of years. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">After reporting expenses and excluding a goodwill impairment of $77 billion in 2011, we\u2019ve worked that number down to $69 billion in 2013. As we\u2019ve been clear with you, we expect additional cost savings in 2014 as we continue to execute on both our new BAC and our legacy assets and servicing initiatives.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We\u2019ve also focused on addressing our legacy mortgage issues, and although we still have work to do, we have made progress. On our credit costs and our provision costs, we\u2019ve seen tremendous results as net loss rates in our portfolios are at levels not seen in nearly a decade.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">As a result of all this work, earnings have improved significantly, but we still have not approached the true earnings potential of Bank of America. So as we move to slide two, let\u2019s talk about recent results in the business on a business by business basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We\u2019ve been delivering solid growth in activity and relationships across all the groups of our customers and clients we serve. Let me highlight a few of those for you. Deposit levels continue to reach records each quarter. While this growth has been occurring in balances, the rate paid has been declining to what we believe is low against our peers, at 8 basis points in our consumer businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Our operating costs, which we focus on heavily, of our deposit business has declined to just 200 basis points now. Driving this improvement is the work we\u2019ve done to optimize our delivery network in our stores in response to customer behavior changes across time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Banking center over the counter transactions continue to go down, but ATM, online, and mobile transactions continue to grow. We understand this, and we observe this in our customers, and we\u2019re working with them to capitalize on arguably the largest and best-positioned branch network in banking.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">However, branches to remain a critical component of everything we do. We have about 8 million customer visits a week, the kind of traffic we really appreciate, and most retailers would give their right arm for.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Meanwhile, as that traffic comes in, the customer behavior continues to shift to ATMs, online, and mobile, and that\u2019s given us the opportunity to be more efficient and at the same time continue to deliver innovative products to our customers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">When you move to our mass affluent customer base, we\u2019ve seen deepening across the customer relationships. Merrill Lynch Brokers assets continued their strong growth. We\u2019ve invested heavily in a sales force for what we call our specialist sales force, and that\u2019s grown to 6,700 people in 2013. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Looking at what that sales force has been able to do, this year we opened 350,000 new Merrill Lynch accounts, 125,000 new small business deposit and card accounts as well during 2013. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">As we move to our industry leading global wealth investment management business, we continue to break records on top line profitability. We just recorded the best year in the company\u2019s history for wealth management results. We have more customers and clients doing more business with us, and now we manage client assets of over $2.4 trillion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In our global banking business, loan flows have been very strong, now growing for six consecutive quarters. Investment banking is coming off a very strong year, and a very strong fourth quarter. We once again maintained our number two position in fees overall, and grew market share year over year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">As we look at our trading business, our global markets business, we\u2019ve been really pleased with the success we\u2019ve had in equities over the past year, and that\u2019s helped offset some of the industry challenges facing the larger FICC business that we have. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Now, both remain very important customer facing businesses for us. They face some tough regulatory changes as the rules have changed about what the scope of activities is over the past couple of years, but the team, under Tom Montag, has been managing those changes well. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Importantly, we ranked for the third year as a top global research firm. All in all, we believe, if you think back, 2013 was a significant year for the progress this company has made against all the focus areas I mentioned earlier. As we look to 2014, we are well-positioned as a company to meet our customers\u2019 needs by delivering the whole company to every client, and every customer, and winning in the marketplace.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">With that brief introduction, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Bruce to cover the numbers in the quarter. Bruce? </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Thanks, Brian, and good morning everyone. I\u2019m going to start and go through the fourth quarter results, starting on slide number four.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We earned $3.4 billion, or $0.29 per diluted share, this quarter. Total revenues in the quarter on an FTE basis, were in line with the third quarter of 2013 at $21.7 billion and were $22.3 billion if we exclude the negative impact of FVO and DVA as a result of the significant credit spread tightening we saw in our credit spreads during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Our revenues benefitted from increased net interest income, strong investment banking and wealth management fees during the quarter, and were partially offset by lower equity investment gains. Total net interest income of $17.3 billion increased from the third quarter of \u201913 as a result of increased litigation costs, which were $2.3 billion during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">If we back those litigation costs out, and back out $1.4 of the foreclosure lookback expense that we saw in the fourth quarter of 2012, our expenses during the quarter declined $300 million from the third quarter of \u201913 and $1.4 billion from the fourth quarter of 2012. Asset quality continued its improvement and resulted in provision expense of only $336 million. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">I would also mention two additional items that impacted results during the quarter. As I mentioned, FVO and DVA were $618 million, and we also recorded discrete tax benefits of approximately $500 million during the quarter that were driven by tax items that were related to non-U.S. operations, as well as the resolution of certain global tax matters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On slide five, you can see that our period-end balance sheet came in at $2.1 trillion, below the prior quarter, on lower trading assets versus that third quarter of 2013. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Ending loans declined $6 billion due to the decline in residential loans in our discretionary portfolio. Outside of residential mortgages, client and customer lending reflected good commercial and seasonal credit card growth that was offset by expected declines that we have within our runoff portfolios.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Period-end deposits grew $9 billion from the record levels that we saw during the third quarter of \u201913. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Moving down the page, tangible book value improved to $13.79, as the full benefit of earnings was partially offset by a negative move in AOCI as a result of higher rates. Tangible common equity increased to 7.2% during the quarter and during the quarter we repurchased 92 million common shares for roughly $1.4 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">The last thing that I would mention on this slide is, despite the earnings of $3.4 billion, our return on tangible common equity, at 8.6%, remains lower than we would like it to be, but we continue to make very good progress on this front.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On slide six, you can see our Basel I tier one common ratio of 11.19% increased from the third quarter of 2013. If we look at Basel III, on a fully phased-in basis, we remain above our 8.5% 2019 minimum requirement under both the standardized as well as the advanced approaches.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Let\u2019s first look at the advanced approach. Under that approach, tier one common capital increased from the third quarter of \u201913 to more than $132 billion. Our Basel III risk-weighted assets remained steady at $1.3 trillion, and our common ratio improved slightly from the third quarter of 2013 to 9.96%. Under the standardized approach, our estimate of Basel III tier one common ratio improved a touch from the third quarter of \u201913, and remained slightly above 9%. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">If we turn to the supplementary leverage ratios, based on the proposed U.S. requirements that are expected to take effect in 2018, as of the end of 2013 our bank holding company leverage ratio improved from the third quarter of \u201913 and continues to exceed the proposed minimum of 5%. Looking at our primary bank subsidiaries, BANA and FIA, they also continue to both be in excess of the 6% proposed minimums. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">The last point I would make on this topic, the BCBS published final supplementary leverage rules over the weekend, and while we do note some improvements from the original proposal, we\u2019re still evaluating the exact impact to us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">If we turn to slide seven, funding and liquidity, our long term debt ended the quarter $6 billion lower, which further improved our funding costs. Global excess liquidity sources during the quarter increased $17 billion to $376 billion, and was driven by our strong deposit flows.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">The time to required funding at the parent company increased to 38 months, and as we look at 2014, we have $31 billion of parent company maturities during the year. And once again, we would expect the issuances to be below that number as we both reduce as well as smooth the maturity profile of that debt footprint.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">The other thing I would mention is that we do expect to see some additional issuance within our banks this year, given the applicability of the new liquidity rules and how they apply to the bank\u2019s subsidiaries.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">If we turn to slide eight, net interest income, our net interest income on an FTE basis was $11 billion, which was $520 million over the third quarter of 2013. The fourth quarter of 2013 did include $210 million of positive benefits in market related adjustments driven by lower premium amortization from slower prepay assumptions on mortgage-backed securities as long term rates rose 30 basis points from the end of \u201913 to the end of \u201914.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Our net interest income, excluding those adjustments, was $10.8 billion, representing a $241 million increase from the third quarter of \u201913. Roughly two-thirds of that improvement was driven by trading-related net income and the balance, once again excluding market-related adjustments, was driven by lower long term debt levels and, to a lesser degree, higher deposit levels and lower rates paid.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Net interest income in those benefits were partially offset by lower consumer loan balances and lower yields. As a result of these different factors, our net interest yield, excluding market-related adjustments, improved from 2.4% in the third quarter of 2013 to 2.51% in the fourth quarter of \u201913.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As we move into 2014, I do want to remind you that the first quarter includes two less interest accrual days, so the Q4 \u201913 base of just below $10.8 billion, excluding the market-related adjustments, all else being equal, would start at roughly $10.6 billion for the first quarter of 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Our asset sensitivity position remains positioned to benefit from higher rates, particularly from the short end of the curve. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">If we move to expenses, as I mentioned earlier, noninterest expense was $17.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2013 and included a $2.3 billion charge for litigation expense. Litigation expenses increased $1.2 billion from the third quarter of \u201913, as we continued to evaluate our legacy exposures, largely RMBS litigation, which led to additional reserves. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Excluding litigation, total expenses were $15 billion during the quarter, which compares favorably to the $15.3 billion in the prior quarter and $16.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2012. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Our legacy assets and servicing costs, once again excluding litigation, declined nearly $400 million from the third quarter of \u201913 and were below $2 billion this quarter, as we previously guided. This drove the $300 million improvement in expenses adjusted for litigation in the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As we continue to reduce the delinquent loans serviced over the course of 2014, and reduce operating costs, we expect the fourth quarter of 2014 LAS cost, excluding litigation, to be roughly $1.1 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Move for a moment to new BAC, the benefits from new BAC in the most recent quarter were offset by a small seasonal uptick in costs when comparing to the third quarter of \u201913, and when comparing to the fourth quarter of 2012, our new BAC savings are partially offset by roughly $300 million of increases from revenue related costs on higher global banking and markets and GWIM revenues. We remain on track to achieve the expected $2 billion of new BAC cost savings in mid-\u201915 as these initiatives wind down near the end of 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">If we move to the number of full time equivalent employees, we ended the quarter at 242,000 employees, a decline of more than 5,000, or 2.3%, from the third quarter of \u201913, and that was split pretty evenly between staff reductions in LAS and the production side of the mortgage business, as volumes declined, and to a lesser extent we reduced staff associated with our branch optimization.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Before I leave expenses, I do want to remind you all that the first quarter typically includes the annual cost of incentives for retirement-eligible associates, and once again we expect, in the first quarter of 2014, that number to be approximately $900 million, which is consistent with what we saw in each of the first quarters of 2012 and 2013.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">If we move to slide 10, on asset quality, you can see that credit quality once again improved nicely. Net chargeoffs declined to a reported $1.6 billion or a net loss ratio of 68 basis points. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">The quarter did include $144 million of chargeoffs related to clarification of regulatory guidance on accounting for TDRs in the home loans portfolios. If we exclude that change, net chargeoffs were approximately $1.4 billion or a 62 basis point net loss ratio and improved $250 million, or 15%, from the third quarter of 2013. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Delinquencies, which are obviously a leading indicator of net chargeoffs, declined again as well. Our fourth quarter provision expense was $336 million on the back of this steadily improving consumer data, resulting in a reserve release of $1.1 billion, excluding the regulatory guidance change. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">As we move into 2014, we continue to see credit quality improve.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Let\u2019s now move into a discussion of the businesses, and I\u2019m going to start on slide 11, with consumer and business banking. Within this segment, we delivered improved earnings for both the previous quarter as well as the prior year\u2019s quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Net income of nearly $2 billion in the fourth quarter of \u201913 is up 11% from the prior quarter and 36% from the fourth quarter of 2012. Stability in revenues, lower credit cost, as well as expense reductions driven by network optimization drove the improvement in both periods. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">If we take a step back and review customer activity during the quarter, we saw our average deposits grow steadily and rates paid down to 8 basis points. Our brokerage assets increased 7% from the third quarter of \u201913, and are up 26% year over year on both improved market valuation as well as account flows.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Our consumer card loans showed seasonal growth this quarter, as well as continued strong issuance, with 1 million cards issued during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">I would note that our fourth quarter of \u201913 balances reflect the reclassification of roughly $1 billion of an affinity portfolio that was moved to loans held for sale, and we would expect seasonality to move these balances lower in the first quarter of 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Our risk-adjusted margin on credit cards is now back above 9%, driven by seasonal spending and improved credit quality as net chargeoffs and delinquencies continue to improve.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Our expense levels during the quarter do include approximately $112 million of litigation costs and that masked the benefit of our delivery network optimization as mobile banking usage continues to increase and we continue to consolidate banking centers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Let\u2019s move to slide 12, consumer real estate services, which as you all know represents only 8% of the company\u2019s revenues. In our supplemental information, we report two separate components of this segment, one focused on loan origination and the other focused on servicing and legacy issues.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">As we signaled last quarter, our first mortgage retail originations of $11.6 billion were down 49% from the third quarter as the amount and level of refinancing opportunities slowed given the rising rate environment. Lock volumes declined 37%, leading to lower core production revenue. We continue to reduce our production staffing levels to be consistent with these lower volumes that we\u2019re experiencing. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Our rep and warrant expense was $70 million during the quarter and declined by roughly $250 million from the third quarter of \u201913, which benefited mortgage banking income.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">One item I do want to mention from the appendix of our slide deck is on page 20, regarding represent and warrant exposure. We did receive increased levels of private label claims, but it\u2019s important to note that the vast majority showed no evidence that the claimant reviewed the individual loan file ahead of the submission, and that obviously impacts the overall claim quality and therefore the process for claims resolution.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">The other primary revenue component in this segment, servicing revenue, declined $54 million from the third quarter of \u201913 as a result of our smaller servicing portfolio. From a cost of servicing perspective, our number of 60-plus day delinquent loans dropped 73,000 to 325,000 units at the end of 2013, and as a result of this, once again our LAS expense ex-litigation declined nearly $400 million during the quarter to $1.8 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Global wealth and investment management, on slide 13. This represents 21% of our company\u2019s revenue and our wealth management business achieved records for net income in both the quarter as well as for full year 2013. Within this segment, both Merrill Lynch as well as U.S. Trust maintained their strong leadership positions, managing a total of $2.4 trillion in client balances.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Revenue approached $4.5 billion in the quarter, increasing 7% year over year and 2% on a linked quarter basis. And I would also note it\u2019s the fourth consecutive quarter in which the pretax margin was above 25%. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Our asset management fees once again achieved a new record during the quarter, driving the revenue improvement from the third quarter of 2013. Our client engagement remains strong, and market levels are providing an additional tailwind.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Our long term AUM flows for the quarter were $9.4 billion and $48 billion for the year, nearly doubling the 2012 production level. Ending deposits also grew nicely again, and our ending client loan balances of almost $119 billion reached record levels as we continue to see very good activity in both consumer real estate as well as our security based lending.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Turning to slide 14, global banking, our fourth quarter earnings of $1.3 billion showed good growth over the third quarter of \u201913, with strong investment banking results, but are down from the fourth quarter of 2012 due to higher provision expense.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Provision in the year ago quarter included reserve releases while we built reserves in the fourth quarter of \u201913 associated with the commercial loan growth that we\u2019ve seen. While we\u2019re on credit quality, I would note that our net chargeoffs within the banking segment for the quarter were only $7 million versus $132 million in the fourth quarter of \u201912 and $35 million in the third quarter of \u201913.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Our expenses reflect effective cost control, but also reflect increased related to revenue related compensation for investment banking. Our investment banking fees this quarter across the company were a record $1.74 billion, up 9% from the fourth quarter of 2012 and 34% from the third quarter of 2013.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Based on [Dealogic], we did maintain our number two position and fees with an 8% market share, and in addition, during the quarter we ranked number one in Americas investment banking fees with a 10.7% market share.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">During 2013, we advised on 10 of the top 20 announced M&amp;A deals, and as we move into 2014, the pipeline remains strong. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">If we move to the balance sheet, average loans increased $8.8 billion from the third quarter, with solid C&amp;I growth, particularly in large corporate and healthcare, along with growth in commercial real estate. Our average growth did outstrip our $2.3 billion end of period growth as we funded several deals near the end of the third quarter of \u201913, which benefited the overall average balances.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We see solid customer demand for loans as we head into 2014, but would note that competition is particularly aggressive for middle market loans.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Lastly, on banking, our average deposits increased almost $20 billion from the third quarter of \u201913 as our customers continue to show strong liquidity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">If we switch to global markets, on slide 15, ex-DVA, we earned $341 million in the fourth quarter of \u201913, consistent with the fourth quarter of \u201912, but down $190 million compared to the third quarter of \u201913 after we exclude the U.K. tax charge. Higher revenue in both comparisons was offset by litigation costs, mostly associated with RMBS securities litigation. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Sales and trading revenue, once again ex-DVA, was $3 billion, 19% above the fourth quarter of \u201912 and in line with what we saw in the third quarter of \u201913.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Our fixed sales and trading revenue were up roughly $300 million or 16% compared to the fourth quarter of 2012, as the strength we saw in our credit and mortgage businesses more than offset slowness in both rates and commodities. Our fourth quarter of \u201913 did include roughly a $200 million benefit from recoveries on certain legacy positions within the FICC business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Our equity sales and trading area finished a very strong year. Revenues, although down 7% from the third quarter of \u201913, were up 27% over the fourth quarter of 2012 as we continue to benefit from the repositioning of this business over the past 18 months. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">We gained market share and improved our performance in each of the different product lines. Expenses, excluding litigation, showed very good cost controls and small increases, in line with revenue improvement.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Our average trading-related assets are down $54.3 billion, or 11%, from the year ago period and are generally flat with the third quarter of 2013.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">On slide 16, we show you the results of all other. Profitability this quarter, compared to the third quarter of 2013, declined as the tax benefits this quarter that I described earlier were more than offset by lower revenue and less reserve release.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">The revenue decline from the third quarter of \u201913 was driven by lower equity investment gains. If you recall, we sold CTB shares during the third quarter of \u201913 as well as more negative FVO valuations. The expense within all other includes $250 million of litigation in the fourth quarter of \u201913. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And lastly I would note we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 30% in 2014, absent any unusual items.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Before we open it up for questions, let me make a few comments on the quarter. Capital and liquidity have never been stronger. On the revenue side, customer activity drove stronger core business results. Our consumer banking saw modest improvement on card income and service charges after troughing in early 2013. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Our global wealth and investment management business had a record year. Our global banking had a record year as well, with higher investment banking fees and stronger lending activity. And our global markets business is performing well against the market opportunities that they\u2019re seeing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">We kept our cost initiative work on track, and credit improvement continues its track towards historic lows. We also made significant progress in 2013 in continuing to resolve legacy mortgage matters with the more significant ones being settlements with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on GSE rep and warranty issues, MBIA in the monoline space, and the Luther Maine State class action suit in the private label area of RMBS litigation. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And with that, let\u2019s go ahead and open it up for Q&amp;A. </p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p7\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">We\u2019ll take our first question from John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">I was wondering, in terms of the core net interest income, you mentioned that the seasonally adjusted starting point for the first quarter would be 10.6, but it sounds like you expect that to keep grinding higher with the debt paydowns and rates being a little bit higher on the long end. And the $300 million that we saw this quarter, is that a good representation of the pace that core NII could grow at?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">I think if you look at what we saw during the quarter, we had a series of benefits for the quarter. If you look back at our tables, the margin that we saw within some of the repo and other global markets lending activity was up nicely. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">As you mentioned, we benefited from the continued reduction in the long term debt footprint, which was clearly a positive. And we had a little bit of benefit, even if you back out FAS 91, on the debt securities lines. So I think those three things were clearly favorable. We\u2019ll have to see with respect to the markets margins, as well as just overall rates, where we go in the first quarter of \u201914 relative to \u201913. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I would be careful to assume that you\u2019re going to see $300 million type improvements in the NII as we go forward on a quarter to quarter basis. But over time, with the work that we\u2019re doing, we would expect that number to continue to grind upwards, all other things being equal.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Any material change in your interest rate sensitivity overall, Bruce, to long rates and/or short rates? </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I would say that whenever rates move up, you tend to widen out a little bit as maturities extend in the mortgage space as rates move up. So you always have a little bit of that in a rising rate environment, although given where rates are, we think we\u2019re largely through that. And the only other thing from an absolute liability management perspective I would note is that as it relates to both managing OCI risk as well as managing to LCR, you saw it a little bit in the fourth quarter, and you\u2019ll see it a little bit more going forward, that we are purchasing on the margin some additional treasuries given the treatment they have under LCR.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And then I was wondering if you or Brian could speak at a high level about how you approached this year\u2019s CCAR. Are you looking to grow your buybacks off of the $5 billion common request from last year? And do you feel that you\u2019ve improved the earnings enough and consistency here to start moving the dividend up yet?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">We\u2019re not going to comment on specific items with respect to the CCAR request. I think we\u2019ve been pretty consistent as we came into 2013 that we were focused on increasing the core profitability of the company. And as you look at the last couple of quarters, from an EPS perspective, we think we\u2019ve done a good job of that. You can see the capital build that we\u2019ve had, and you can see the reduction in the legacy exposures that we\u2019ve made. So we feel like we did a good job of preparing ourselves for CCAR this year, and we\u2019re obviously working hard as we go through the rest of the process between now and mid-March.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And then last thing is you mentioned, Bruce, the 8.5% return on tangible, and, you know, hope that that goes higher over time. Your ROA was 64 basis points. I guess what kind of goals do you have for ROA and ROE over the next few years, and any thoughts on timelines that you hope to get there on?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">As we look out over the three years, I\u2019d say it\u2019s more of the same for us, but you can see a tangible common equity ratio that\u2019s just over 7%. The three metrics, if we assume we stay at around that 7% level, we were above it in the fourth quarter, but if we stay at that level, we\u2019re looking to get to the point where we\u2019re returning 1% on assets, which translates into a 14% return on tangible common equity. And those are the types of levels that we see ourselves looking to achieve over the course of the next three years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">We\u2019ll move next to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">One on the NIM discussion that we were just having. When you look at what happened with the yield and the cost of funds, it looks like you\u2019re getting a little bit more competitive on non-resi consumer. And just wondering how to think about how you\u2019re looking to shift, either the loan growth going forward and how you\u2019re thinking about that loan yield relative to your cost of funds in an environment where NIB probably doesn\u2019t grow as much as it had been in the past, maybe your cost of funds is flattening out, or potentially increasing a little bit.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I\u2019m not sure exactly which piece you\u2019re looking at, Betsy, but if you go back to our earnings supplement, which is back on page 10, I think it\u2019s interesting that you can see from the third quarter of \u201913 to the fourth quarter of \u201913 that our yields on residential mortgages did increase about 6 basis points to 3.74%. And the other interesting thing is that we have started to see and be able to do more home equity type business with our core customers. I think it\u2019s interesting, if you look at the yields on that portfolio, they were up 20 basis points to just under 4% for the quarter. So as we look at the yields and the rates that we\u2019re able to get, I think we\u2019re competitive in the market and we\u2019ve been able to see some slight increases within the rates that we\u2019re able to earn.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Sure, it\u2019s an interesting mix shift, because you\u2019ve got a little bit of a shrinkage going on obviously, with the legacy resi still coming off, yet the yields there are increasing. And on the non-resi consumer, you\u2019ve got some yield compression happening, but your loan growth, at the margin, is inflecting more positively. Cost of funds looks like it\u2019s probably settling out here and potentially even going up a little bit. NIB average balances were still up Q on Q, but the period was down. So that\u2019s kind of the full context of the question. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Brian Moynihan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">You\u2019ve got the [unintelligible] going through, or the pay, on both sides of the rate question, and then we continue to see deposit pricing, liability pricing came down, the contribution of noninterest bearing size in the balance sheet continue to go up. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">But just focusing on the production, what\u2019s really going to happen across the last several quarters that we\u2019re seeing stabilization in some of the balances, and the runoff portfolio impact gets smaller and smaller from some of the noncore portfolios they\u2019re getting rid of. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">But in the fourth quarter, for example, our direct auto, which in 2013 our direct auto business - not our indirect, but our direct-to-consumer auto - was up 55%. The home equities in the fourth quarter were up almost 100% over the prior year\u2019s fourth quarter. Year over year, they\u2019re up 60%. The card, we had about 19% more production in the fourth quarter of \u201913 versus \u201912. And the business banking, small business area, we\u2019re seeing production up. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So we\u2019re building the basics that are producing the balance growth. And the pricing spreads are holding. It\u2019s competitive [unintelligible], middle market and things like that. So I think it all serves us well, largely having run off stuff that may have yielded high, but may have high credit cost content, you\u2019ve got to remember, and we\u2019re replacing it with stuff that\u2019s good in core and a great credit quality. And so we\u2019re seeing a shift a little bit from the commercial loan growth, which was really more positive to where the consumer loan growth was starting to stabilize and come along. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">When do you think you get that inflection point in loan growth? Clearly it\u2019s a function of legacy, basically not weighing on the loan growth overall. When does that inflection point happen?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Brian Moynihan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">If you look at the various portfolios, I think in card we\u2019ve kind of seen it. As Bruce talked about, we got a sale. I think in home equity, you\u2019ve still got a ways to go, because remember, we\u2019ve got about 40% or so of our home equity is still in the noncore portfolio. And then I think in the commercial side, you\u2019ve seen the straight growth, whether it\u2019s large corporate or commercial middle market. So I think that would be the overall summary. I think it sort of came through from the corporate activity, moved faster to the small business activity, and then the consumer activity, but we\u2019re stabilized in most of the portfolios, and growing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And then just turning to the mortgage for a moment, on LAS expenses, did I hear you right that you are looking for LAS expenses to be at about $1 billion at year-end? Is that correct, on a quarterly basis, 4Q \u201914?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yeah, we called it roughly $1.1 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay, so that\u2019s an uptick, right, from what you had been saying before, sub $1 billion by year-end?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yeah, that\u2019s correct. It\u2019s about $100 million higher than what we had said before. And I think the work that we\u2019re starting, take a step back, that we got through roughly $400 million during this quarter, which was a little bit better than we would have expected to do. So we felt very good about that. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And if you look at the number of 60-plus day delinquent loans, it came all the way down to 325,000 loans. So what we\u2019re going to be working on over the course of the next 90 days is a little bit of a reset of that expense base, so that we can continue to drive that number down. That $1.1 billion doesn\u2019t reflect that, but given the work and the activity levels, we need to go back and do some more work on that. <strong> </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So $1.1 billion by year-end \u201914. Is there still runway in \u201915 to bring that down further? </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We\u2019ve been consistent that we would expect and look to end 2015 at roughly $500 million a quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And then just lastly, on the litigation reserving, you called out the $2 billion litigation reserve for the mortgage business, highlighted that that reflects a lot of the litigation risk you think you have. The question we get from people is how many more quarters of this should we build in going forward? Because you do still have some lumpiness in the lawsuits that you face. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">That\u2019s always a tough quarter. I think what I\u2019d say is that there was obviously a lot of new learning that we saw during the fourth quarter of this year, and as a result of that, we adjusted the reserves for the legacy exposures to reflect that which we learned. And as we\u2019ve said, it was largely with respect to RMBS litigation. And beyond that, it\u2019s just a number that\u2019s difficult to predict.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Our next question comes from Matthew O\u2019Connor of Deutsche Bank.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Matthew O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We\u2019re seeing some peers that came out yesterday actually increasing liquidity and long term debt levels to meet the LCR. I think you guys are starting at a higher point maybe than they were, but just give us a sense of maybe where you are for LCR under the current proposals. And as we think about kind of the net impact of long term debt running off at the holding company, increasing at the bank, how does that all shake out on a net basis this year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Brian Moynihan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I\u2019ll let Bruce talk you through it, but we\u2019ve got to remember how we got here, which is just, you know, with the legacy set of companies put together, they had debt structures that were built for their company and their industry without the core funding that we have. So we\u2019re coming down to a level most of our peers were below, and they may be coming up a little bit. So you\u2019ve got to remember that whether it\u2019s [unintelligible] or Merrill Lynch, the funding structure was so different. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So we had like $400 billion of long term debt we\u2019ve been bringing down, and the size of the balance sheet shrank. We started off at about $2.5 trillion and we\u2019re down to $2.1 trillion. So I\u2019d be careful about comparing where they\u2019re going versus where we\u2019re going based on this, just because what we had is different from what they started with. And then Bruce can talk about what we think from where we are now going forward. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">As we look out, I think at the parent company, as we look at, and with our understanding of the LCR ratio, we are in the 100% area as it relates to LCR. So at the parent you can look at us being where we need to be based on 2017 levels.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">The one area that we will look to do more in, and I highlighted it, is to further build and take out more term financing within the bank levels to look to build that. So I think we\u2019re in great shape at the parent. We\u2019re in great shape at the banks, but you will see us doing a little bit more bank financing activity to be able to meet those requirements. And if you look at where we\u2019ve financed it at the banks, there\u2019s no incremental cost for that that\u2019s different than what we\u2019ve communicated before. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And the other thing I would just point out, on the overall debt footprint and the cost of it, is with the work that we\u2019ve done on the balance sheet, and with where our credit spreads are now in the market, we will be refinancing our debt at lower rates than the debt that\u2019s coming off of the books as it matures.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Matthew O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And with the parent being around 100% right now, any sense of how much cushion you want? I think some banks are running at maybe a 15% cushion. Some banks are still trying to get to where you\u2019re at.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I think to project a cushion three years out, I think we clearly are going to run at a cushion. We\u2019re going to run the company. So this is not an issue. But until we get out to 2016 and 2017 and understand the exact composition as well as any puts and takes that we\u2019re seeing, it\u2019s probably a little bit premature to talk about a cushion. The focus has been to get to the 100% at the parent immediately, so it\u2019s not an issue to discuss.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Matthew O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And then just separately, we saw out of JPMorgan yesterday a one-time valuation adjustment on certain derivatives. And just wondering, is that applicable to you? Or have you been absorbing it over time, or still to come?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">It\u2019s obviously applicable to anyone that has an uncollateralized derivative book. So it is applicable to us. I think that clearly the industry view and how you account for FVA is still very much evolving. JPMorgan obviously came out today with their adoption, and as a company, it\u2019s something that we continue to evaluate. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I think the important thing to remember, when you look at this, and I\u2019m sure you know this, is just that this is a question of do you take a reserve for something that you earn back over the average life of your uncollateralized balances? So it\u2019s not something that changes the core economics of the activities that we\u2019re doing. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr of ISI.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">On the balance sheet migration over the past year, cash and equivalents up 19%, repo; trading assets and derivative assets all down say 10-14%. Is that a function of some of the sluggishness on the trading side during the year in the market, and it\u2019s just a reaction to what\u2019s out there? Or is this your intent to get on [size] for SLR and LCR?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I would say that as we look at, and what we\u2019ve said is from an LCR and an SLR basis, given that we\u2019re at the levels at the parent and then with respect to the supplementary leverage ratio at the banks, given we\u2019re at the levels that we need to be that phase in between 2015 and 2019, there\u2019s not anything directly related to those given that we\u2019re in great shape with respect to those.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">What I would say is that as we move forward and as we look at the bank level and some of the rules, you will see us, on average, carrying a little bit more cash at those levels. And you saw that as you look at the year-end numbers. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And as it relates to the different repo activity and the like within the global markets business, you continue to look to manage and balance what\u2019s the size of that book, how it affects the overall size of the company, and the yield that you\u2019re able to achieve. And I think that was one of the things, as some of these different regs come out, that we feel good, that if you look at the repo book we were up 7 basis points from an average yield perspective Q3 and Q4. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So those are numbers that are going to ebb and flow, but I would say directionally we feel very good about where balance sheet is.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Brian Moynihan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Our approach has been, as these rules come out, to put ourselves in compliance, or whatever the right word would be, immediately, not wait so that we didn\u2019t have it hanging over us. You know, could you get to the LCR, could you get to the supplemental leverage? So we just said position the balance sheet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">But what I\u2019d say is, as you look at the company\u2019s sort of constitution in terms of business mix and balance sheet mix at the year-end \u201913, we\u2019re very comfortable with that. So there will be ebbs and flows, loans will grow here or maybe market [we\u2019ll use] a little more balance sheet on a given quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">But Tom and the team have done a good job at sorting being able to face against the customers and maintaining our strong market position in all our businesses, investment banking, sales trading, fixed income, and equities both, while at the same time bringing the balance sheet year over year down. But we\u2019re completely comfortable with it being in the size range it is now, and expect it to stay roughly in there. So I don\u2019t think we\u2019d see massive changes in how the company looks to comply with rules, because we\u2019re already in compliance. </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And global markets, the trading in absolute numbers and relative to some peers is pretty good. The question I have is if you look at the return on capital or the return on average assets, it\u2019s pretty low. I\u2019m curious how much litigation cost dented that? Because I know it dented it, we just can\u2019t say exactly how much. And are these metrics we should be looking at on a consistent basis? They\u2019re in the supplement. I\u2019m assuming they mean something, I just don\u2019t know if the capital allocations and the asset allocations are fair things to judge on.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I think as it relates to the capital allocations, that they clearly are, and one of the things that, if you look back in the footnotes, that we highlighted, is we will refresh those allocations in 2014 and continue to have more capital pushed out within the businesses. As you look at the returns within the markets business, I think you need to adjust for two numbers when you look at those. The litigation number within the markets business was north of $600 million for the quarter, and then you had another $200 million during the quarter for DVA. So when you look at the returns, you need to adjust for those two numbers and realize that in the fourth quarter you\u2019re looking at what\u2019s seasonally the slowest quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Final one is in mortgage. I think there was a bit of a hiatus as you\u2019re getting things battened down. I think you picked up about 100 basis points market share since then on the retail side. Just curious for an update on how the fourth quarter looked, and then your thoughts on going out in terms of intentions to continue to push that share higher.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brian Moynihan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I think if you look at it, you can calculate the statistics, but we were down. We had two things going on during \u201913, in the second half especially, as the HARP volume started to fall off, because we sized our portfolio down in terms of total servicing size. So our HARP opportunity went down, and then obviously as rates went up, sort of mid-year out, the volumes dropped.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And so the third quarter the pipeline pulled through and helped us get $20-odd billion in the fourth quarter down to $11 billion. But if you look at it sort of the non-HARP share, we are pleased with the progress we\u2019re making, and we\u2019ll continue to, direct to consumer, grind that forward from where we are now to about $9 billion this past quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And so I think we\u2019re fine. It\u2019s going to be a business that we shape to serve the customer, and the wealth management business does a couple billion in the quarter. It\u2019s a good, solid position. I would say in January, with the rates moving down a little bit and stuff, you saw another tick up of about 20-25% in application volume in our book already. </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Now, I don\u2019t know if that holds, and how much is seasonality, because of the way Christmas and New Year\u2019s fell this year and things like that as we move through the month, but it immediately picked up over the last several days as rates moved a little bit in our favor. And the purchase volume has also moved up in January. </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So we\u2019re looking for this business to start to grow again, but it obviously suffered both the rate effect and also the HARP effect in the fourth quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">We\u2019ll move next to Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer &amp; Company.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer &amp; Company </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I wanted to come back to the debt footprint discussion, and just looking on page 11, you can see total average long term debt down $27 billion year over year. And at the same time, looking at page 7 of the presentation, the time to required funding expanded from 33 months to 38 months.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So I\u2019m just curious, is there some other liability that is extending while you\u2019re bringing down the debt footprint? And how can we gauge for the year ahead? What I\u2019m getting at is how can we triangulate on how much further room there might be in the debt reduction?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I think the important thing, and if I understand your question, when you look at the time to required funding, there are a couple of components that go into that. There\u2019s the amount of liquidity that you have at the parent, obviously, and then what the debt footprint is over the course of the period of time that you\u2019re measuring it. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And if you look at what we\u2019ve done, we\u2019ve basically, if you looked at our company at the end of 2012, we had $70 billion of debt maturities that we needed to work through over the course of 2013 and 2014. And you obviously need to carry significant amounts of liquidity to be able to basically meet your time to required funding when it\u2019s that lumpy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">What we\u2019ve done is between the debt that we repaid this year as well as the activity you saw when we tendered for debt several times in 2013 for debt that was maturing in 2014, was to knock down those maturity profiles. So you\u2019re asking a very good question, which is over time, what you should expect us to be able to do is continue to move the parent company funding down. And as we flatten out those debt maturities, we\u2019ll be able to do that and not have nearly the impact on time to required funding, because the maturity profile will be much flatter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer &amp; Company </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And then as a follow up, looking at your 10-K and 10-Q, you give us a very nice breakdown of the debt by parent company versus Merrill versus BofA NA, and your parent company looks like, at least between year-end and September, like it was relatively flat. And the declines in the long term debt came primarily from Merrill Lynch, going from like $90 billion to $60 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Does Merrill Lynch, as an entity, need to continue to pay down debt? Or can that essentially be all squeezed into other subsidiaries? And does that have an impact on the cost of funds?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">A couple of things. Keep in mind we told you when we reported third quarter earnings that the Merrill Lynch holding company that had previously issued debt before the merger of the two companies, that has been merged into the BAC holding company. So when you look at that debt profile, realize today it\u2019s one and the same. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So I think the important thing I would look at is on page seven, and what we do is we give you the actual what we consider parent company. And that parent company, back in previous quarters prior to ML &amp; Co. and BAC merging, is a combined number. So if you look at those red bars on the bottom on page seven, that is the combined debt footprint of the two companies that is now one. And you can see that over the course of five quarters migrating down. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Our next question is from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Just a couple of quick follow ups. On your Basel III tier one common, the standardized versus advanced, you have I guess almost a 90 basis point difference. Some of your large bank peers are closer to a 10 basis point difference. Can you help us think about why you have such a large gap between the standardized and advanced?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">The first thing I would say is that generally we would expect that gap to narrow over time. But as you look at the actual content of it, I think the biggest reason that you have is just given the percentage in some of our commercial loan balances that we have relative to our peers, that under Basel III advanced, get impacted significantly based on the actual credit quality, where when you go to standardized, it\u2019s just 100%. </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So I think the first thing is you do have some of that activity or difference between the two metrics. And then I would say that the second thing is that we still do have some assets that, under Basel III standardized, do get some fairly risk weightings that we will continue to work off over the next couple of years. </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So there\u2019s no question relative to what we\u2019ve seen out there we\u2019re a little bit wider. I think those are a couple of the differences. And as I said, I\u2019d expect over the course of the next 12 to 18 months you\u2019ll see that gap tighten.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So on the commercial side, as credit gets better, we should see that gap close, for that reason?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">No. The commercial credit getting better, that\u2019s not going to lead to it getting tighter, because under standardized, a commercial loan is a commercial loan. There\u2019s no benefit of credit quality. It\u2019s going to be more the runoff of some of the different positions that we have within the company as opposed to anything specific on commercial.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And then just a follow up on your eventual ROE target, or a tangible ROE of 14%, when you\u2019re kind of discussing that target, is that assuming some help from interest rates being higher? Or is that without that help?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">As we look at 2015, 2016, we don\u2019t do anything besides just look out at the forward curve. So you do get a little bit of benefit at the very end of \u201915 and a little bit more so in 2016. So there is embedded some of that. At the same time, to the extent that we\u2019re not in an environment, in an economy, that\u2019s growing, and we\u2019re seeing some of that movement up in short term rates, if we\u2019re not seeing that then there are other actions that we\u2019re going to need to take within the company.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Our next question comes from Steven Chubak of Nomura Securities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Steven Chubak - Nomura Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">One thing that we did see over the past year is a pretty robust pace of DTA consumption, which certainly helped boost your capital ratios. I know when contemplating DTA utilization, the mechanics can be quite complicated, but how should we think about the potential level of progress as we enter 2014 as your earnings profile continues to improve?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">As we work through 2014, a fairly healthy percentage of what would show up in the tax provision line will not reduce our regulatory capital. And as we go out in \u201915 and beyond, how quickly the balance of that goes is going to be a function of profitability. But what I would say is that as it relates to working through the DTA, and it is a complicated calculation, that we should get a very large amount of what we pay in taxes back in regulatory capital during 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Steven Chubak - Nomura Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And then just thinking about some of the profitability targets you highlighted, such as the 14% tangible ROE, what are you guys assuming in terms of capital return over that potential horizon? </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Unfortunately, I can\u2019t answer a way around we\u2019re not going to give any more guidance on CCAR than we\u2019ve already given.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Our next question comes from Paul Miller from FBR Capital Markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">On the origination side, you did talk a little bit about that you\u2019re improving your retail side, but the refis have gone down. You\u2019re down to like 4.5%. Where do you see your market share? And where do you think you can take your retail market share? And also, what do you think about non-QMs? I know some banks have come out and said they will start doing some non-QMs. I didn\u2019t know where you stand on that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Brian Moynihan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">We think that ultimately, if you look at our market share and other product capabilities, given the ebbs and flows of the rate environment and, you know, faster refis, lower refis, whatever\u2019s going on. We have a 10% or 13% deposit share, we think, in consumer deposits. We have a higher percent in cards, etc. Home equity is bigger. We should be pushing towards upper single digit level in mortgage. </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">It just will take time, because we\u2019re rebuilding that process, which was not geared toward serving the core customers and just doing it, and the team\u2019s been doing a good job of building that fairly steadily. And the purchase volume percent I think is in the 30s this quarter. And so we\u2019re getting there. </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So that\u2019s our goal. It will just take us time, and we\u2019ll drive that. But in terms of the direct to consumer production, I think we\u2019re second largest now, and we plan to keep driving that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">On the non-QM and things like that, we\u2019ll meet the needs of our customers by using our balance sheet, because remember, we do a lot of mortgages today through our wealth management business and stuff. And so we\u2019ll work through the rules. </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">But for the standard products, obviously, for the general consumer and the Fannie eligible, Freddie eligible, FHA type products, we\u2019ll be following all the rules and making sure they go through the standard process to get them off the balance sheet and into the securitization process. But in terms of putting stuff on the balance sheet, I think we meet the needs of customers, and we\u2019ve been doing it for years. </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And on the jumbo loans, I know a lot of the institutions are going after the jumbo product. You don\u2019t break out your jumbo product, but is that an area of focus for you guys? And if it is, what types of yields are you getting on that product?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Brian Moynihan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Inherently, when you have one of the largest wealth management businesses as a focus, so of our production about 20-odd percent comes from the wealth management business, and the yields on the product are competitive. We have to compete in the market, so it\u2019s a market-driven business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">It obviously depends on the product, you know, floating versus fixed. But you\u2019re clearly seeing credit spreads on a floating basis for some of those customers and the spreads of 100 to 150 basis points from a floating rate perspective.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And is there any update on the state of New York, where they stand with approving the Bank of New York settlement of $8.5 billion? Do we know when that\u2019s going to come to a conclusion?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Brian Moynihan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">We do not. There\u2019s no update at all besides the fact that the trial\u2019s over, and at this point you know what we know.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">A couple of things. In the mortgage business, I noticed that it looked like the revenue stream from the LAS servicing actually went up from the third quarter. Is that something that will remain at that level? Or does that come down with the servicing assets?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I think you need to look at, within legacy assets and servicing, I know it\u2019s completely counterintuitive, but recall that the reps and warrants is a [contra] revenue line item. So we had the lower rep and warrant provision for the quarter, was the big delta.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">In terms of the card business, you talked about the 1 million plus accounts and you\u2019ve kind of done that both third and fourth quarter. Just talk a little bit maybe more generally about the strategy there. Are there any things that you\u2019re doing to kind of maintain or increase that? And also kind of on the other side, are there other affinity portfolios that your partners are going to ask for back as we go into \u201914?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Brian Moynihan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I\u2019d say on the affinity side, we basically repositioned that business as a loss for three or four years, and I think we\u2019re kind of where we are at this point. The strong affinity partners we have that have done well, we continue to support them and continue to drive production there. </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Think about the Cash 123 product, the balance rewards, and the travel rewards products, core products that we continue to drive. And the production of those products continues to be up significantly year over year, and that\u2019s what\u2019s driving us from a couple of years ago maybe 700,000 cards a quarter maybe up to a million-ish now per quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And so that is good, because it is our core branded product with a great product for the consumer and they use it. And so what you\u2019re seeing as you look at some of the detail we give you in the supplement and stuff, you\u2019ll see that the average spending is going up, the average spending per card is going up. And so that, obviously, is more efficient and is an indicator that you\u2019re becoming the primary card in the wallet for customers. </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">With that, though, one of the drags is the spend rate. We\u2019re in the low 20s on payment rate. In other words, the people who are paying us and not carrying balances, because of the affluent customers. So that\u2019s a little bit of drag. But they charge enough that you can make it through the interchange. So we\u2019re very comfortable with the business. We spent three or four years on positioning. </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">But the good news is with the credit quality that we\u2019ve seen from originations [unintelligible] and things like that, we\u2019re getting the 9% risk adjusted margin. So we\u2019ve ended up with the right spot, where we\u2019re getting production growth, i.e. more cards, with our direct customers, with a good strong margin. And we like that. </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Then you might say, well, why don\u2019t you push it harder, because it\u2019s returning so well? The issue is to do that you have to go to places where I think it\u2019s not our core strength. And so you should expect us to just grind forward on that. </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Following up on the DTA question, how do you think about, and how do you believe the Fed thinks about, that DTA consumption kind of as part of a CCAR submission?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I think the interesting thing is that as you move forward and you look to test under Basel III, NOLs are not eligible as capital under Basel III. So there\u2019s good news and there\u2019s bad news. The bad news is you don\u2019t get to count it, the good news is that it eliminates the likelihood that you have a difference relative to the way somebody else looks at your deferred tax position. So given that CCAR is based on the way regulatory capital works, that\u2019s how the deferred tax assets flow through. And once again, under Basel III, you don\u2019t get to count NOLs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So you\u2019re saying they do consider the capital generation as opposed to just your earnings?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I can\u2019t comment on the way the Federal Reserve looks at that, but our belief is that\u2019s correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Brian Moynihan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">The point would be this year you\u2019re sort of in transition, but as you go forward and the expectation is you move to Basel III, it becomes sort of a nonelement and it\u2019s out of the calculation already.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">We\u2019ll take our next question from Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Question on how we should think about the fact that last year your capital return really included not just the buyback authorization of shares, but also the redemption of the preferreds. So you could add the two numbers together and say, $10.5 billion out of last year\u2019s CCAR. Is there some conversion factor that we should think of for the preferreds in terms of saying what the 2013 baseline really was?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">As you look at the preferred that we redeemed, the yields on those preferreds were between 8% and 9%. And once again, I\u2019m not going to speak for the Federal Reserve, but I think most people looked at that and said\u2026 at least the way we looked at it was that we look at the heavy content of tier common that we have, and you look at preferred that\u2019s 8% to 9% after tax. And I think most people would look at that and say it makes good corporate finance sense, and it\u2019s a good thing for Bank of America to retire those. </p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Given the work that we\u2019ve done on the balance sheet, you can see that the majority of what we have left from a preferred stock perspective is priced at competitive rates. So I would be very careful to thinking of and including that preferred stock redemption and assuming that it was evaluated as common stock. </p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Right, but is there a factor that you use in thinking about what it would convert into in terms of the capital return?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">No, because it was straight preferred stock. It had no conversion features whatsoever.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I\u2019ve had a number of clients ask me the question this morning about the significant increase in the yield on the securities portfolio, just from the third quarter to the fourth, and obviously long rates are up a lot. But is it just that, or can you link that to the couple hundred million dollar benefit that you were talking about in terms of the market related impact?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">No, you\u2019re absolutely correct. If you adjust for the FAS 91, the delta Q3 to Q4, the increase was only 2 basis points.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And I know you said that on the SLR, with the Basel add ons, you\u2019re still evaluating that. But JPMorgan was out saying yesterday that their estimate was that it probably only increased above and beyond the NPR. Sorry, decreased their leverage ratio by about 10 basis points. Are you thinking similar order of magnitude? Or are you really not in a position to comment at all at this point?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Brian Moynihan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I\u2019ll make a couple of comments on that, and you know, we\u2019ve got teams, as you can imagine, culling data and spending a lot of time with it. The couple comments I would make is that the changes that were made from prior BCBS rules to the new rules, as it relates to both the credit conversion factor as well as the netting for securities financing transactions, clearly are less punitive than what the original BCBS proposals were.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I would say on a very preliminary basis, as we look at it, I would say that we think that the impact to us is a little bit more than what JPMorgan quoted. That being said, with our ratios above 5% at the parent, and above 6% at each of the banks coming into this, we feel like we\u2019re in very good shape with respect to compliance with the supplementary leverage ratio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And then I guess the final question that I\u2019d have for you, and it\u2019s along the lines of some of the ones you\u2019ve been asked about, you know, further reductions in the long term debt footprint. Obviously there\u2019s been some speechifying by members of the Fed about not seeing banks reduce their long term debt levels much below where they are now. Is there some rule of thumb that you guys are using in the absence of any defined orderly liquidation or [bail] in capital definition yet as to what you would want your total long term debt plus tier one capital to look like as a percentage of risk-weighted assets that you\u2019re using as a guidepost to help you figure out how much long term debt to bring down?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Brian Moynihan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I\u2019ll let Bruce give you his thoughts on that from his perspective, but before we get to it, you\u2019ve got to remember what I said earlier is our company has shrunk and our equity has gone up. So when you think about that, if you shrunk the company about $300 billion to $400 billion in size across the last three or four years, and your equity balance has gone up, and your deposit balance has gone up, what you\u2019re going to do to balance the balance sheet is take the long term debt footprint down. That is because we fundamentally got rid of a lot of businesses and assets and things that weren\u2019t necessary to do what we do today. </p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">So there\u2019s just a difference between us and our peers who have been more organic in how they came together in the last few years. So I\u2019d just be careful. Obviously we work with the Fed and all this redemption [unintelligible], like we can make the capital plans, and as you said liquidation authority and structure, but a lot of our reduction has come by shrinking the scope of the company and the $2.1 trillion and change from $2.4 trillion to $2.5 trillion. And that\u2019s going to allow us to sort of reshape and get rid of assets that were noncore and not yielding. </p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">So I\u2019ll let Bruce answer sort of the rules, but remember, we started from a different place, because as someone said earlier, Merrill had a lot of debt, because they didn\u2019t have the deposit funding we did. </p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">We hear the same thing that you do. We hear the numbers quoted of very high teens that you need to be at from a common plus your debt footprint that\u2019s greater than a year. If we look at where we are today, from that metric, we\u2019re in the low 20s today, which as we compare ourselves to our peers is higher than where our peers are. </p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I think what you\u2019re going to see as we go forward, and I referenced this earlier, this is the last year of big debt maturities, where we\u2019ve got north of $30 billion at the parent that comes due. So I think what you\u2019ll see for us going forward is you\u2019ll see us issue less today at the parent than what matures at the parent.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">As you get out to \u201915 and beyond, it tends to be much more a $20 billion a year type maturity profile. And the impact in \u201915 and beyond, assuming we continue to do what we should with the balance sheet, the impact in \u201915 and beyond is going to be more about the cost at which we\u2019re raising debt relative to the debt that we\u2019re retiring, whereas we do have one more year, which is this year, of shrinking the actual total amount.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">We\u2019ll move next to Matthew Burnell with Wells Fargo.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">First I guess the bigger picture question and then just a couple of administrative questions. You\u2019ve mentioned a couple of times your view about cards and the progress you\u2019re making not only in getting cards in the hands of your customers but also the use that your customers are taking with the cards in terms of charging more. I guess I\u2019m just curious as to what your outlook is for actual balance growth over the course of 2014, presuming that we are in a somewhat better economic environment this year versus the last couple of years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Brian Moynihan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">A couple of things would drive that. If you look at the last three or four quarters, you can see that we kind of flattened out. Around the holidays you get a seasonal bump and it comes out, so Bruce said earlier that you should expect the card balances to come down in the first quarter just because of that. But if you look at it, it\u2019s been $90-odd billion in the U.S. business consistently. </p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">What we did see in the latter part of last year is more usage on the credit side, which from a general economy perspective is actually good news, in that people were using the credit versus debit, and we look at the usage of our cards and what they\u2019re used for in a given quarter. So credit spending was up better among all the customer bases, in October and November and in December. </p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">So I\u2019d say we\u2019re set up, because we\u2019ve gotten rid of the balances of the cards that we were running off, and that\u2019s really a very low percentage now, to have the thing stabilize. I don\u2019t think it will have large balance growth, because it will kind of work with our customers and what they\u2019re doing. And we have a substantial part of the people who pay us off. But the good news is, underlying, you have seen a little more credit usage fundamentally in the last couple of quarters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">And then Bruce, I think you mentioned a couple of quarters ago that you were targeting a branch count for the company in round numbers around 5,000. You\u2019re basically there as of the end of this year. Is there potentially a push to get that number materially below 5,000, or at this point do you think you are where you want to be?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">When I referenced the 5,000, that was in the context of starting at just under 6,000 branches and the work that we were doing with respect to new BAC. I\u2019d say that we continue to track towards that 5,000 number. What\u2019s probably a little bit different from what we saw in new BAC is that we\u2019ve been able to actually sell some of those branches that are, for us, out of market to local banks as they look to build up their local presences, which I think is a good thing for everyone.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">And as we look forward, I think there will be a condition evaluation that we have at this point as to the opportunity and the cost versus the benefit of the branches. But I would directionally think of us being 5,000, maybe a few less than that, before the end of 2014. And there\u2019ll be a continued evaluation that we\u2019ll have beyond have the ability to.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Brian Moynihan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">We\u2019d always focused people on the branch count because it was a fairly effective way to show how we were trying to do it. The reality now is as you look at the different formats, we\u2019re always putting new branches in the market, as leases run off, repositioning the branch, consolidating branches and adding these express formats that we\u2019re testing and stuff. </p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">So the definition of a branch is changing in terms of what you would traditionally think. And so after period, which Bruce talked about, you\u2019re really going to be where the customer is leading you. But the branches are critically important, and you always use the example, in one market we were able to take four branches and put them in one larger one, have the Merrill team [unintelligible] commercial banking teammates, and the core personal bankers and teammates in the branch. </p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">So we don\u2019t know exactly where this goes, because it will be dependent upon customer behavior, but what we do know is we have to dominate the physical side and the ecommerce, online mobile side at the same time, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re investing heavily in both platforms. So we have probably a half a billion dollars we put in the online mobile platform across the last three or four years, and we\u2019ll continue to invest at that rate. </p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">And you can see the feature functionality return and the usage of that platform has grown tremendously. For example, in the fourth quarter of \u201913, % of all the checks deposited by consumers went through the iPads and mobile phones. That was up from 7% the quarter before. And didn\u2019t exist until basically the third quarter of \u201912. </p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">And so that\u2019s what we\u2019re driving, because of customer convenience and usage. At the same time, we have 8 million customers coming into our branch, and the engagement rate for those customers is going up. And so the team is less about what number of branches, and more about how the distribution process works between phones and ATMs and mobile and branches and express branches, ATAs, which are tellers through the branch. And then we\u2019re deploying more people to sell in all those regards. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">So presumably over the next two to three years, you could see the square footage of the total branch base come down potentially fairly dramatically given all the electronic delivery mechanisms that you just mentioned?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Brian Moynihan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Yes, dedicated to transactions, but the square footage dedicated to sales could increase.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">And then just finally, what was your percentage of mortgage volume this quarter that was dedicated to purchase? And how does that compare to the third quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">32% was purchase this quarter. And I think it was 21% in the previous period.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">We\u2019ll move next to Nancy Bush with NAB Research.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Nancy Bush - NAB Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">I think we all appreciate the tremendous progress you\u2019ve made on increasing profitability at the company and getting things turned around, but there is a perception out there that you\u2019re going to have a gap up in profitability when short rates start to go up. Can you just give me your thoughts about that? Is that indeed a correct view?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">You know, in each quarter we look at our asset sensitivity on the balance sheet, and our constant metric that we look at is what does 100 basis points do to our net interest income, and obviously that flows directly to the bottom line. And at the end of the year, a 100 basis point move up was worth between $3 billion and $3.1 billion to us from a net interest income perspective. </p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">So we clearly will benefit from short term rates. We obviously don\u2019t control that, and so I think the important thing is that, as we look at near term benefits that we have, we continue to have a lot of work to do on expenses in both 2014 and 2015, because we\u2019ve got another $500 million a quarter of new BAC savings that will get implemented between end of \u201913 and end of \u201914. </p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">And then with the guidance that we gave today, another $700 million a quarter to get out going into 2014 to where we end 2014. So we do look forward to those days of higher rates, but in the meantime, we\u2019ve got a nice chunk of expenses to get out that we do not believe will impact the revenue generating ability of the company. </p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Nancy Bush - NAB Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">And just kind of to add on to that, do you have a sense, at this point - and this sort of goes back to the previous question - when rates do start up, given everything you\u2019ve done in the deposit gathering network, how profitable will that be in the next cycle as opposed to, let\u2019s say, three or four years ago?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">If you look at page 11, where we give the profitability of the consumer business banking, and that\u2019s obviously the one that benefits the most by the short term rate rise, because the constitution of deposits is non-interest bearing, and it picks it up. And you can look at the returns there in the supplement. And you can see we\u2019re up to about $2 billion in after tax income and the returns clearly exceed the cost of capital. </p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">And it will benefit, but in the meantime what we\u2019ll be doing is driving the cost structure down. In the deposit franchise, almost 300 basis points of cost to run the deposit franchise as a percentage of deposits, down to 200, in opening that up. So it will absolutely help that business. But meanwhile, it earned $200 million this quarter after tax, which is not bad either.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">We\u2019ll go next to Eric Wasserstrom of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Just one small question, also on the mortgage business. Doing the simple gain on sale mathematics, it looks like you had a rebound in your gain on sale sequentially, which is pretty consistent with what we\u2019ve seen from others. But the magnitude looked much greater. It looked as if your gain on sale in the period was back to more or less year-ago levels, which doesn\u2019t seem intuitively right. So I just wanted to get your view on that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Yeah, there was one piece internally between the home loan space within LAS and what we have in all other. So if you adjusted that out, you\u2019re not seeing material changes in the gain on sale.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Brian Moynihan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">The core production margins have come down and stayed pretty flat. Don\u2019t read into that that we\u2019re doing something different.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">So just sequentially, you would characterize the margins as largely flat? Is that right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">We\u2019ll move next to Mike Mayo with CLSA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">You said the banking backlog was up. Was that versus the third quarter or year over year? And can you quantify that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">I think I characterized the backlog as strong at this point. And I would say it\u2019s strong both relative to the third quarter as well as to the year ago period.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">And which areas in particular?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">The interesting thing that we\u2019ve seen coming into this is that the M&amp;A business, and if you look at activity levels and just what\u2019s been announced over the course of the last week, that it does feel like some of the M&amp;A deals that are being talked about are going to happen. </p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Obviously there are a number of them that are still being negotiated and may or may not happen, but M&amp;A activity clearly feels like it\u2019s beginning to pick up and ramp up from what we\u2019ve seen. You saw within the overall debt businesses very good growth both year over year as well as linked quarter, and I would say that that business as well as the market conditions continue to be quite strong. </p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">And you then move to the equity side, the fourth quarter was obviously a very good quarter from an IPO perspective. And typically coming into the year you have a little bit less visibility on that, because a lot of that tends to happen after people wrap up their year-end numbers. But given overall valuations and what we\u2019re seeing, we\u2019re optimistic on the equity side as well. </p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">So I think there\u2019s not one piece that we look at within those pipelines that don\u2019t feel pretty good. And the only thing I\u2019d say as a cautionary note is that you are comping against a period that\u2019s the highest investment banking revenue period we\u2019ve ever seen in the history of the company. </p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">And then switching gears, the wealth management margin, 26.6%, can you give that to us excluding U.S. Trust? It just helps with apples to apples comparisons with peers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Brian Moynihan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">U.S. Trust adds maybe 150 to 200 basis points. So that gives you a sense of it. But what drives our margins is what I said before. It\u2019s the holistic nature of the Merrill Lynch wealth management business. Because they have the wonderful classic investment business, but also they have a good deposit base and a good loan base, and all the work the team does there under John Thiel. But it adds about 150 to 200 basis points.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">And loan utilization in commercial and wholesale, where does that stand?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Within commercial, it continues to be in the very low 30s. <strong> </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">So no change?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">No change. The only thing that we are seeing that\u2019s a little bit of a change, and we\u2019ve talked about it before, is if you look at the amount of funded commercial and corporate loans relative to our total commitments, that\u2019s been very much a focus of what Tom\u2019s looked at. And we\u2019ve seen that migrate up to where it\u2019s just under 50%. So while we\u2019re not seeing line utilization as much, we are seeing, across our commercial and corporate books, that the funded commitments relative to total commitments has increased.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">And I wasn\u2019t sure, what is your net interest margin outlook for the next quarter or two? And you mentioned FAS 91 for the debt security yield. To what degree, if the yield curve has flattened a little bit here recently, do you get some of that back with that net interest margin?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">We talked about that, which drove the margin in the fourth quarter. I would say that across the board the margin was very strong in the fourth quarter. So you\u2019ve seen numbers in the low 240s. You\u2019ve seen it at 251. I would think about that being generally range-bound at this point in time with what we see.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">And with regard to new BAC, could you just repeat, how much do you have left, and how much do you think hits the bottom line this quarter. You spent a little bit more money for revenues, which I guess makes sense if you have the opportunity. But I just want to size that again.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">We\u2019ve said that we\u2019ve got $500 million to get through over the course of the next four quarters. And I would say that\u2019s going to generally be earned over time. So I wouldn\u2019t think of it being any more than 100 to 125 is generally the way that you\u2019ll see it phase in.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">I\u2019m sorry, like $100 million to $125 million per quarter then, and that should hit the bottom line? Or you might look at reinvesting those gains?</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Well, we\u2019ve committed to saying that our new BAC savings have to be net savings to the company with the caveat that to the extent that businesses are doing more revenues from where we started, that we\u2019ll pay out. And that\u2019s what we did see during the fourth quarter from both the global banking side, as well as wealth management. </p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Keep in mind, and I think this is important as you look at the first quarter, we\u2019ve got two things that generally happen in the first quarter, one that we know does, and one historically the trend would suggest it does. I mentioned the FAS 123 that you have in the first quarter. We know that\u2019s going to be an incremental $900 million. </p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">The other thing that historically has been true is that the sales and trading business, the first quarter historically is the most significant quarter within that business. So the incentive compensation, given that we accrue based on revenues, tends to be seasonally highest in the first quarter. And you add that, plus the $900 million I mentioned, and it\u2019s not an insignificant number. </p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">So we, once again, feel very good we\u2019ll get the new BAC savings on a net basis over the course of \u201914. Just realize the first quarter has those two components. </p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">And then lastly, you mentioned the goal for an ROA of 1% over three years. And I just wanted to understand what you mean by that. Do you mean at the end of 2016 going into 2017 you look to have an ROA of 1%? Or do you mean the average over these three years?</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">What we\u2019re referencing is as we look out over three years, at the end of the third year, that\u2019s where we would look to get to, which, given our current leverage profile, is around 14% on tangible common.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Okay, so at the end of 2016, you look to have an ROA of 1%, with the forward curve the way it stands. And with those assumptions, what sort of change do you expect with the certificates of deposit or CDs, which are historically low for you and others? Do you have money moving out of CDs at that point, or not yet? You\u2019re around 15% of deposits. Historically it\u2019s around 35%. </p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">I would say the general expectation should be that that number is going to be at or probably move down a touch from where we are today given the performance of the core deposit franchise.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">And then on page 49 of the proxy, it mentions PRSUs, and they kick in with an ROA of only 0.5%, whereas you seem to be shooting for an ROA of 1%. How will your new expectations for the next three years translate into more formalized metrics or compensation? Is it more than simply a general target? How does it sink into the organization?</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Brian Moynihan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">I think the targets that we have for performance we\u2019ll put out in the proxy this year when the board goes through the process over the next several weeks. But I think in the past it\u2019s been based on getting us back to a level of profitability in the company, and that\u2019s what is reflected.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">And in very simple terms, if you look for a 1% ROA on $2 trillion of assets, you hope to be at kind of a $2 annual run rate in the later 2016?</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">The one piece, and once again, we\u2019re not going to give it, is that if you\u2019re just doing that simple math, you\u2019ve not made any assumption with respect to the change in shares. So once again, given that we\u2019re in the middle of CCAR, we\u2019re not going to comment on that. But you do have some benefit over time through share count.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">We\u2019ll move next to the site of Derek De Vries of UBS.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Derek De Vries - UBS </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">I just had two questions. First, I think in the December conference you mentioned that there\u2019s been a 70% increase in referrals to wealth management from other parts of BAC. I\u2019m just wondering if you could elaborate on that a little bit. Is that environment driven? Or have you implemented some specific programs? And then maybe just give us a sense of how meaningful those referrals have been at the net income level?</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Brian Moynihan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">We have a very stringent program that\u2019s driven in each market by our market presence teammates, where count the referrals that go in, we count the close rate and who participates and all that. And then markets are stack ranked, and we monitor monthly to see how they\u2019re doing and reward the people doing well. Then we set aggressive goals. </p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">And this year, for 2013, they hit all the goals. Every market was in good shape. And so it is a fundamental way our teams operate in the markets together. When you get to specifically the things that work well for wealth management, you have the connectivity, when there are liquidity events, so called business sales, IPOs and things like that, where we bring in business, we\u2019ll look at, through November, and I haven\u2019t seen a final count yet, we had about 675 401k retirement plan closed sales in 2013. We had about 200 and some in 2012. </p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">And that is driven through the Merrill retirement plan business that Amy [unintelligible] and John Field drive, and delivered between national teams and the financial advisors in the market. So that gives you kind of a sense of how this works. The dollars from that I think are in the $5 billion to $6 billion range, if I remember exactly. </p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">So it\u2019s all those types of flows. And then several tens of thousands of customers come from the consumer bank into the wealth management platform, referred from the preferred teams. But that goes on, and those customers come into the branch that have asset bases that are consistent with Merrill Lynch and U.S. Trust service models. We move them in. </p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">So it\u2019s a whole bunch of things, but it\u2019s tracked literally person by person to make sure it happens. But frankly, the teams like to work together and win in the market, and that\u2019s what you see when you go into our markets and talk to the teams that do it. </p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Derek De Vries - UBS </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">And then switching gears entirely, just talk about the leveraged finance business. I think when you look at the industry, you\u2019re seeing record [covenant light] issuance, and you\u2019re seeing some pretty favorable pricing for issuers. How do you think about this business over the next few years, both from a revenue perspective but also from a risk management perspective? </p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">The leveraged finance business is a very good business for us. If you look at historically we are number one or two in that business. And if you look at, on an overall basis, our debt origination both investment grade as well as non-investment grade, it tends to be an $800 million to $1 billion a quarter type revenue stream. </p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">And we believe, particularly given some of the new capital guidelines and the competitive landscape, that we are doing better in that business than we have. From the risk management perspective of it, you\u2019ve got two different components of it. You have the underwrite to distribute component to it, which one of the most notable changes I think has been, over the last couple of years is the risk gets distributed from the underwriter to the investor generally much quicker, even in the context of deals that have a lag time from the time that they\u2019re committed to where they\u2019re distributed. So that\u2019s a positive from a risk management perspective. </p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">And then with respect to the hold pieces, we continue to be very disciplined with respect to the hold levels that we have on those deals. And the other thing I\u2019d say is if you just look at mix of business now, relative to what you saw 12 months ago, a lot more of the leveraged finance business tends to be coming from corporate customers that are either privately held or public and as valuations have gone up, less of it tends to come from the private equity firms. </p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">So it\u2019s a business that we think we\u2019re very good at. Our team has done a very good job of being mindful of the risk that\u2019s associated with it over the last couple of years, and it\u2019s a business that we\u2019re optimistic of. </p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"><strong>Derek De Vries - UBS </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">Just to paraphrase what you said, you\u2019re very comfortable on the risk management side, and you\u2019ve taken market share, it sounds like. But I don\u2019t think you gave an answer in terms of where you think the revenue outlook is for this business over the next couple of years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">The revenue outlook I think in many respects, as we look out at the profitability, we feel very good about the outlook. And this is probably the business that most benefits from increased M&amp;A activity, particularly on the corporate side. So to the extent that corporate M&amp;A picks up, you would look to see this business continue to have favorable trends. The word of caution would just be that it is a market dependent business, and as you all know, periodically there are gaps in time where the new issue market, particularly on the high-yield side, does slow down, sometimes materially. But on balance, we feel very good about the business going forward. </p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">And our final question comes from Andrew Marquardt with Evercore Partners.</p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">Just wanted to go back to the retail branch banking strategy shift, and Brian you\u2019ve been clear about this evolution of everyone having a branch in their pocket, and so not totally surprised about targeting shrinkage in branch count in \u201914 and \u201915. But to frame it out a little bit more, does that provide additional expense leverage beyond what you\u2019ve kind of long been talking about on new BAC and LAS? Or is there an investment spend component that we need to be mindful of as well?</p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"><strong>Brian Moynihan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">Obviously, you\u2019re getting more and more to the core franchise, so the relative amount of movement we can make, and remember, couple that with we\u2019re investing in people and we\u2019re investing in technology to make it all work. We\u2019re always going to be working. That\u2019s our job. </p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">But I\u2019d be careful about assuming, beyond the new BAC cost that Bruce talked about, that there would be a lot of net after that, only because we are investing so heavily in the electronic space, which is still building in front of us. </p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">But the theme is right. It\u2019s really how do you keep driving down the overall operating costs of all the platforms relative to the revenue stream and the deposit base, obviously, because that drives a lot of the revenue stream of the business. And so I wouldn\u2019t pull to the bottom line. But you can assume that we\u2019re going to be diligent in terms of managing that change and transition to help provide more investments, frankly, if we can. </p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">And where do you think you are in terms of that investment cycle for mobile banking, in terms of deliverables? </p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"><strong>Brian Moynihan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">We\u2019ve got a great product, and I think sort of a steady state. We spend, just overall, about $3 billion in change in annual technology development. And we expect that number to stay constant over time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">On an annual basis?</p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"><strong>Brian Moynihan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">On an annual basis, yes. Because we\u2019re rebuilding a system. But that\u2019s all built into the dialog that we had about new BAC.</p>", "<p class=\"p p25\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p25\">And then separate but sort of related, on expenses, with new BAC, that\u2019s left to realize in LAS. How much of that? Should we have kind of a step function down on kind of the absolute level of expenses off kind of the core 4Q run rate of call it 15.5 type levels? Should we see by the end of \u201914, heading into \u201915, should we take out $1.5 billion, or are there other costs related to maybe investment spend elsewhere that we need to be mindful of?</p>", "<p class=\"p p25\"><strong>Brian Moynihan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p25\">I think if you look at the chart we gave you, we try to isolate on the costs. You know, the bar chart on page nine. You can see that the red bars are sort of the core, take out the litigation, LAS. So you have to put some back, because there will always be some litigation. You have to put some back for just running the servicing portfolio. But we\u2019re shooting to drive in the numbers that take those numbers and then you have to grow them and be careful of the FAS 123 type of thing and which quarter you\u2019re looking at. </p>", "<p class=\"p p25\">But our job is to keep driving toward that core expense base. And then it should grow, if we\u2019re growing revenues, the economy growth rate, 100 basis points above that, we\u2019ll grow expenses probably half of that. And that takes a lot of work to keep that expense down, because the people content reaches 50-60% of our expense base, and our people do a great job, and we\u2019ll pay them. </p>", "<p class=\"p p25\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p25\">And I would just add to that. On the LAS piece, we guided to roughly $1.1 billion at the end of the year. So with respect to the gray bar on page nine that Brian referenced, I would think of that 1.8 to 1.1 happening generally pro rata over the course of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p25\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p25\"><strong> </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p25\">And we\u2019ve still got a lot of cleanup there. If you look at one of our peers who announced yesterday, you can see that they\u2019re probably doing their mortgage servicing expenses, maybe 30% to 40% of ours. And that\u2019s just because we\u2019re still getting through the higher [unintelligible] content portfolio. And it lags a little bit getting this stuff done.</p>", "<p class=\"p p25\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p25\">And then Bruce, you had said in your prepared remarks that credit quality continues to improve into this year. Should we read into that that there\u2019s still meaningful credit leverage left to be realized in terms of reserve releases? Or are we closer to the end here in magnitude?</p>", "<p class=\"p p25\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p25\">I think you\u2019re closer to the end on magnitude, from a reserve release perspective. It\u2019s always a little bit hard to predict, obviously, because the reserve releases are a function of what\u2019s happening in the underlying credit. But generally, I would say that you would expect to see chargeoffs continue to decline, and you\u2019re obviously going to see the reserve releases, given the magnitude they\u2019ve been, you\u2019re going to see those slow down as well with the one delta just being what\u2019s the overall loan growth that you\u2019re seeing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p25\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p25\">And then just lastly, just to wrap up some of the Q&amp;A on the CCAR capital deployment, just to be clear, it seems like one should not use the $10 billion combined preferred and common last year as a base. It really needs to be a $5 million at the baseline on common that you\u2019ve got to prove for last year, and hopefully, we\u2019ll make our own assumption, but it seems fair to assume you could move upward in terms of deployment this year off that kind of base. Is that fair?</p>", "<p class=\"p p25\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p25\">We agree with your characterization of the $10 billion number. [laughter] That was our last question.

(Operator instructions) It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. Lee McEntire. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Lee McEntire</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning, thanks for joining us on the web as well as the phone this morning. Before I turn the call over to CEO, Brian Moynihan and CFO Bruce Thompson, let me just say that we may make some forward-looking statements. For details on those I will refer you to our Page 24 and 25 in our earnings deck material, either the website or our SEC filings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">With that I\u2019ll turn it over to Brian.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Brian Moynihan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you, Lee. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us to review the first quarter results. As you can see from our numbers, we report a loss this quarter. That loss reflects the cost of resolving more of our legacy mortgage issues, as well as adding reserves primarily for previously disclosed legacy mortgage related matters. As disappointed as we are in the bottom-line results; we\u2019re pleased to report that the businesses reported earnings at a level that will allow us to substantially offset these losses. And also at the same time we were able to sell grow and improve our Basel III standardized regulatory capital ratio during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Bruce will take you through the particulars of our results. But first I want to spend a couple of minutes looking at the progress we continue to make across the customer groups that we serve. In particular, we added some slides to the appendix on pages 17 and 18, which highlight multi-year trends across our customer groups. Let me just touch on a few of those and connect them to our results.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">When you think about broad consumer franchise for mass-market consumers, affluent and wealthy consumers, as we think about the mass-market group, the strategy in our retail segment has been to lower the cost of service, so we could improve our customer experience. We do that by continuing to optimize our delivery networks of all types in response to customer behavior changes. Banking centers and basic teller transactions continue to decline as customers move their business to mobile and online transactions. Yet we still have many millions of visits each week to our branches. But in the aggregate, our self-service channels of ATM, online and mobile transactions continue to grow. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">This quarter, more than 10%, of all of the deposit transactions that consumers make in our Company are now done through mobile devices, as people effectively carry a branch in their pocket. This, coupled with other measures allowed us to reduce our cost in our consumer banking business, 4% from last year\u2019s first quarter. It allows us to continue to invest in other areas to further improve customer satisfaction and grow sales.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">On the preferred side of our consumer business, where we serve mass-affluent clients we continue investing in this group by adding sales specialists. We now have more than 6500 sales specialists concentrated in the top banking centers. We have also increased service associates to drive satisfaction of these clients as well. The end result, when you put all consumer business together is a segment -- is organic deposit growth of $23 billion from last year to a total of $535 billion in deposits. On investment side of this general consumer client base, our Merrill Edge assets grew 21% from last year. When we put the segment together, the earnings in our consumer and business banking business improved 50% year-over-year to nearly $1.7 billion this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">As we move to the wealthy part of our consumer client base, in our wealth management business with U.S. Trust of Merrill Lynch, client balances again grew this quarter and now total over $2.4 trillion. This has driven record asset management fees in the segment and we are seeing growing demand from these customers for other banking products as loans and deposits continue to increase. This business made over $700 million after tax this quarter and had a pre-tax margin of more than 25% for the fifth consecutive quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We will move to our Company side of our house, our commercial and corporate client base. We continue to retain our leadership position investment banking fees with $1.5 billion in fees received this quarter. We also saw solid loan and deposit flows this quarter from our commercial customers. These activities drove a 6% increase in revenue in our global banking business from last year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In a global markets business, which serves investing clients, we are at $1.3 billion after tax, as our top tier sales and trading platforms generated over $4 billion in revenue this quarter. So we put it all together, we have leadership positions that we continue to work on in each area and continue to see good momentum across the year quarter. We\u2019re pleased also to be in a position of returning capital to shareholders as we increased dividends in addition to our newly authorized share purchase program. As usual, as we say each quarter, we remain focused on executing the strategy to connect the capabilities of this company with its customers and shareholders for your benefit. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">With that, I want to turn it over to Bruce to cover the earnings results.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><strong>Bruce Thompson </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Thanks, Brian, and good morning everyone. I\u2019m going to start on Slide 2, and work through the first quarter results. We did record a loss of $276 million, or $0.05 per diluted share this quarter. Driving the loss during the quarter was litigation expense of $6 billion, which cost us roughly $0.40 a share during the quarter. We recorded $3.6 billion in litigation expense for the previously announced FHFA settlement and we recorded another $2.4 billion primarily associated with the increase in reserves for previously disclosed legacy mortgage related matters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Revenue during the quarter on an FTE basis was $22.8 billion, which was $1.1 billion higher than the fourth quarter of \u201913, but below the $23.4 billion we saw in the first quarter of 2013. On a linked quarter basis, our revenues benefitted from improved sales and trading results in asset management fees and were offset by lower net interest income as well as lower mortgage banking revenue.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Compared to the prior year period, revenue was down slightly on lower net interest income, mortgage revenue in sales and trading, but did benefit from higher asset management fees. Total non-interest expense during the quarter was $22.2 billion but did include $6 billion of litigation expense, as well as $1 billion of retirement eligible incentive cost that we recognized during the first quarter of each year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">If we exclude these items from both the first quarter periods, for comparability of the underlying trends that we saw within the Company, expenses did improve by $1.2 billion, or 7% and were driven by lower LAS non-litigation cost as well as some of the new BAC improvements that we saw. Versus the fourth quarter of \u201913, the slight increase in non-interest expense reflects increased revenue related compensation in our markets business and was partially offset by the decline that we saw in our LAS non-litigation expense reductions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Provision for credit losses was $1 billion during the quarter and increased $673 million versus the fourth quarter of 2013. In the first quarter of this year, we released $379 million from our loan loss reserves and that compares to a release of $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2013.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Before we move off of this slide, let me mention that we had a few other items in the quarter that in the aggregate benefited EPS by above $0.04 a share, as higher equity and debt security gains, net DVA and the resolution of tax matters were positives and they were offset in part, by the cost of retirement eligible incentives, as well as the negative market related impacts on our net interest income. One last point on FBO and DVA. This quarter and moving forward, we report the net impact of these two items as one net DVA valuation number for derivatives and structured liabilities within our global markets business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On Slide 3, you can see our period end balance sheet increased from the end of 2013 as we grew both cash and securities in light of increasing liquidity requirements in our primary banking subsidiaries. Ending loans declined $12 billion led by lower residential mortgages, principally within our discretionary loan portfolio, as well as seasonal declines in credit cards. Loans were up in our global banking segment which I\u2019ll cover in a bit. Period end deposits were up $40 billion from the fourth quarter and are up year-over-year by more than $38 billion. Our tangible common equity ratio declined to 7% due to the increase in liquidity that I mentioned earlier.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Tangible book value did increase slightly during the quarter and we repurchased 87 million shares for $1.4 billion, which completed our share repurchase program that we established at this time last year. In following our CCAR results, we announced a new $4 billion share repurchase plan as well as the intention to increase the quarterly common dividend to a nickel a share in the second quarter of 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We move to Slide 4, we look at our capital ratios under Basel III. Recall this is the first period reporting under Basel III transition which became effective January 1 of this year. Under the transition rules, our common equity Tier I capital was a $151.6 billion, well risk weighted assets were $1.28 trillion, which resulted in a [audio gap] we move to the advanced method, our CET1 ratio was 9.9% and was impacted by the increased level of risk weighted assets related to operational risk, which were largely offset by reduction in other risk weighted assets, as well as the increase in capital.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We move to supplementary leverage ratios, we estimate at the end of the first quarter of \u201914 we exceed the recently updated U.S. rule that apply in 2018. Once again that would mean our bank holding company is above the 5% minimum and our primary banking subsidiary BANA and FIA are both in excess of their 6% minimums. I also want to remind you that our tier one capital and supplemental leverage ratios will benefit by approximately $2.9 billion in the second quarter of \u201914 if we receive shareholder approval to amend our series T preferred stock.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">One last item I want to note regarding capital in the first quarter of \u201914, it includes the adjustment, the capital allocations across our business line. We included a slide in the appendix that notes the new allocation. As you look at that, you\u2019ll see that the primary adjustments were allocating more capital to our global banking business given the loan growth we\u2019ve seen in that segment and to a lesser extent increases in both our global market as well as our global wealth management business. As a result of these changes, the amount of unallocated capital that tell that\u2019s held at the parent declined from $16 billion to $5 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We move to the Slide 5, funding and liquidity. Our global excess liquidity sources increased more than $50 billion to a record level of $427 billion as a result of seasonally strong deposit flows as well as some of the bank debt issuance that we did earlier in the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Our total long term debt of $255 billion was $5 billion higher than the fourth quarter of 2013. These figures do not include the $7.6 billion of debt issuance that settled on April 1st, and was executed at more favorable spread than our existing debt footprint. That issuance has enabled us to maintain our strong excess liquidity position of the parent despite the cash flows required by both scheduled debt maturities as well as recent litigation settlement.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Our time to acquire funding remained very strong at 35 months, with parent company liquidity unchanged at $95 billion. Moving forward and as we consider the FHFA settlement, we would expect parent issuance to be below maturity as the focus evolves towards continued yield improvement following the past several years of sizeable balance reductions within our debt footprint.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We move to Slide 6 on net interest income. Net interest income on a reported FTE basis was $10.3 billion, which was a decline of $700 million from the fourth quarter of 2013. That decline was driven by a swing of roughly $500 million associated with our market related adjustment or FAS 91. FAS 91 was approximately $300 million negative in the first quarter of \u201914, compared to the $200 million benefit that we saw in the fourth quarter of \u201913. The balance of the decline was largely due to two less interest accrual days in the first quarter of \u201914 relative to the fourth quarter of \u201913.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Our net interest income, if we exclude those market related adjustments was $10.6 billion, once again down a little over $200 million from the fourth quarter of \u201913. Other drivers in the quarter were lower average consumer balances in yields which were largely offset by a reduction in long term debt cost as well as continued decline in our deposit pricing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As a result of these net interest income impacts, as well as the higher earning assets, the net interest yield, once again adjusting for FAS 91, declined 3 basis points to 0.36% in the first quarter of \u201914. As it relates to asset sensitivity in the balance sheet, we continue to remain poised to benefit from higher rates particularly when the short end of the curve moves up. As we continue to manage our OCI sensitivity, we\u2019re also mindful of both liquidity and leverage roles. Our first quarter 2014 increase in securities included shorter duration treasury security, instead of mortgage backed securities and these treasury securities are much more LCR and OCI friendly but do have lower yields.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Given the continued growth that we\u2019ve seen in our cash balances at central banks as we increase liquidity, we have adjusted our net interest yield to reflect the impact of adding these low yielding cash deposits once again at central banks into earning assets. This had no impact on net interest income, but prior period net interest yields have been adjusted to reflect the change. Given the added liquidity during the quarter coupled with the average balance impact of seasonally lower consumer balances, we expect net interest income in the second quarter of \u201914 may be slightly lower compared to this quarter\u2019s $10.6 billion level, excluding market related adjustments before moving up modestly throughout the second half of 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We move to our expense highlights on Slide 7. Non-interest expense was $22.2 billion in the first quarter of \u201814 and once again included $6 billion charge for litigation expense and $1 billion cost for retirement eligible incentives. As previously mentioned, $6 billion litigation expense did include the cost of the FHFA settlement as well as $2.4 billion in increased reserves associated with our previously disclosed legacy mortgage related matters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">If we exclude the litigation in retirement eligible incentive cost, our total expenses were $15.2 billion and declined $1.2 billion from the first quarter of \u201813 driven by lower LAS cost, but were up roughly 200 million from the fourth quarter of \u201813 on incentives related to improved sales and trading revenue.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Legacy assets and servicing cost ex-litigation of $1.6 billion declined more than $250 million from the fourth quarter of 2013. As you look at that $1.6 billion number, the savings we generated during the quarter were 40% of our targeted quarterly reductions that we\u2019ve communicated to you previously. We continue to make progress on cost savings and as a result, our expense program targets for New BAC as well as LAS remain unchanged.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Turning to Slide 8; you can see our credit quality continue to improve again. Net charge offs declined $194 million to $1.4 billion or a 62 basis point net loss ratio. Delinquencies, a leading indicator of charge offs showed improvement again as well. In our first quarter of \u201914, provision expense was $1.0 billion and we released approximately $400 million of reserves during the quarter. Looking forward, we would expect provision expense for the balance of the year to reflect both modest reductions in net charge-offs as well as reserve releases.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Let\u2019s move to Slide 9 and go through the different business segments, starting with consumer and business banking. Net income of nearly $1.7 billion in the first quarter of \u201814 was up 15% from the first quarter of 2013. Lower expenses, higher service charges a portfolio divestiture gain in lower credit costs all drove that improvement in the first quarter of \u201813. Return on allocated capital within the segment remains very strong at 23% this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">As we reflect on customer activity during the quarter, mobile banking customers grew 19% from the first quarter of 2013 to 15 million customers and customer deposit transactions using these devices now represent 10% of all transactions. Average deposits of $535 billion are up organically $23 billion or 5% compared to the first quarter of \u201813 and our rates paid were reduced nearly in half to 7 basis points. Our brokerage assets surpassed the $100 billion in the quarter and are up 21% year-over-year with the growth split fairly evenly between both increases in flows as well as valuations within the market.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Our card issuance remains strong at a million new accounts in the first quarter of 2014 but our ended period balances are down seasonally from the fourth quarter of 2013. Importantly, our risk adjusted margin remained above 9%. Overall our credit quality within this segment remained strong as our net charge offs declined versus both the linked quarter period as well as the year ago period.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Provision expense was $812 million during the quarter. Net charge offs improved $360 million from the year ago quarter and we released $69 million in reserves this quarter which is $220 million less than the first quarter of last year and down $426 million from the fourth quarter of \u201813.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">One litigation item to note before we move off the consumer results is the resolution we reached last week with the CFPB and the OCC on issues related to the marketing, sale and billing of credit cards, debt cancellation, ID theft protection products. This settlement included cash payments to both regulators and provides for redress the customers and was covered by reserves that had been established in prior periods.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We move to Slide 10; consumer real estate services. The higher loss in the quarter was driven by $5.8 billion of litigation within the segment. Let\u2019s first focus on the reported sub-segment of home loans where we recorded the origination of consumer real estate. Our first mortgage retail originations of $8.9 billion were down 24% from the fourth quarter of \u201913, in-line with overall market demand and drove a 32% reduction in core production revenue as margins held relatively steady compared to the fourth quarter of \u201913.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We continue to reduce production staffing levels in the quarter, consistent with the volumes that we\u2019re seeing but those expenses will flow through the P&amp;L immediately. Home equity originations of $2 billion were up from the fourth quarter of \u201813 level. We moved the legacy assets in servicing sub-segment. Once again the driver here is the previously mentioned litigation cost. On litigation cost, you saw the press release on March 26th regarding our settlement with FHFA, which identified the $6.3 billion payment and led to the $3.6 million litigation charge this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We\u2019re obviously pleased to have this matter put behind us. Within our earnings release, we also included information regarding a settlement with FGIC and related parties on involved securitization trust which resolves all outstanding litigation in rep and warrant claims on second lean loans for approximately $900 million to $950 million depending on the final outcome of two of the remaining trust, two of the nine remaining trusts excuse me.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">This settlement was covered by reserves that we had established in previous periods. The primary revenue component within the LAS sub-segment servicing revenue declined $205 million versus the fourth quarter as the size of our servicing portfolio continues to decline as it aligns with our market share of production and we also have less favorable MSR net hedge performance during the quarter. Also impacting revenue during the quarter was rep and warrant expense of $178 million, which increased by roughly $100 million from the fourth quarter of \u201913, given the settlement during the quarter with FHFA. From a cost of servicing perspective, our 60 plus day delinquent loans will reduce by 15%, 277,000 units at the end of the first quarter of 2014 and once again our LAS expense ex-litigation declined $262 million to $1.6 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We move to Slide 11, global wealth and investment management. During the quarter we achieved record revenue of $4.5 billion, which was up 3% from the first quarter of \u201813 and 2% from the fourth quarter of \u201813. The improvement was driven by record asset management fees during the quarter. Net income of $729 million was slightly higher than the first quarter of \u201813 but was down modestly from the fourth quarter of \u201813 as expense was 3% higher than both periods. Expense increase compared to both periods and higher revenue related incentives increased volume related cost as well as certain investments in technology.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Notwithstanding those increases, our pretax margin remains strong, north of 25% for the fifth consecutive quarter. Our return on allocated capital was 25% but declined from prior period as the relative earnings stability was coupled with the increased capital allocations that I mentioned previously.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Client engagement remains strong in the markets providing additional tailwind as our client balances increased $30 billion from the year-end 2013 to $2.4 trillion. Long-term AUM flows of $17.4 billion for the quarter were the second highest in our Company\u2019s history. Ending client loan balances of $120 billion reached record levels and are up 9% year-over-year. One other highlight I\u2019d like to mention is the coordinated referral efforts that we\u2019re seeing across wealth management and the banking groups as we funded more than 300 institutional retirement plans worth more than 2.4 billion in client assets during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On Slide 12 global banking, earnings during the quarter were $1.24 billion. Earnings compared to the first quarter of \u201813 show a 6% improvement in revenue that were offset by higher expense. Investment banking fees for the quarter were $1.54 billion, consistent with what we saw during the first quarter of \u201813 but 11% lower than the record level that we saw during the fourth quarter of \u201913. We do believe for the second consecutive quarter, this would rank us as a global leader in investment banking fees.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">The remaining revenue drivers in this business, treasury services and business lending show very positive trends year-over-year across both our commercial as well as our corporate client base. You can see some of these metrics on Page 26 of the supplemental information that we provide to you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Provision was up $160 million from the first quarter of \u201913, driven by additions to our loan loss reserves. The first quarter of \u201914 included a build of $282 million, versus the build of $81 million in the first quarter of \u201913 and $434 million in the fourth quarter of \u201913.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">The expense increase in the quarter of $186 million on a year-over-year basis relates to investments in technology for our global treasury services and lending platforms, additional client basing personnel and to a lesser degree some litigation that we saw during the quarter within this segment. When you look at the balance sheet, average loans are up $27.4 billion or 11% compared to the first quarter of \u201913 and are up $2.6 billion compared to the fourth quarter of \u201913.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">The overall pace of growth that we\u2019re seeing has slowed from the past few quarters as pricing for loans is quite competitive and we\u2019ve chosen returns over growth in certain cases. Return on allocated capital was 16% and is down from prior periods reflecting stable earnings that were more than offset by a 35% increase in allocated capital.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">We switch to global markets on Slide 13. Excluding net DBA, we earned $1.24 billion in the first quarter which is in line with the first quarter of \u201913 and up $893 million from the fourth quarter of \u201913. Ex-DBA sales and trading revenue was $4.1 billion, 1% lower than the first quarter of \u201913 but 37% higher in the fourth quarter of \u201913. Our fixed sales and trading revenue was down 2% compared to the first quarter of \u201913 but we would note it would be down 15% after adjusting for a monoline<strong> </strong>write down that we incurred in the first quarter of \u201913.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Our rates and currencies experienced declines from market volumes and lower volatility during the quarter. I would note that our fixed business did increase 42% over the fourth quarter of 2013. Equity sales and trading, flat with the first quarter of 2013 and up 28% from the fourth quarter of \u201913. Expenses were stable compared to the first quarter of \u201913 and when we compare expenses to the fourth quarter of \u201913, they increased $453 million on higher revenue related expenses after excluding litigation of $655 million that we recorded in the fourth quarter of \u201913 within this segment. Our trading related assets on average remain flat at $440 billion on a linked quarter basis. Our return on allocated capital during the quarter was 16%, even after we consider a 13% increase in allocated capital.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">On Slide 14, we show all other. Revenue was down $193 million in the fourth quarter of \u201913 on lower net interest income which was driven by the swing in market related adjustments that I discussed earlier and was partially offset by higher equity investment gains which were driven by the final monetization of an investment. First quarter \u201914 expense includes the retirement eligible incentive cost, which are in line with last year but still drive the expense variance compared to the fourth quarter of \u201913 and was partially offset by lower litigation cost. Provision benefit in the quarter was relatively flat to the fourth quarter of \u201913 but did improve $385 million from the first quarter of \u201913. Net charge-offs of $206 million improved $88 million from the fourth quarter of \u201913 and $279 million in the first quarter of \u201913.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Our first quarter of \u201914 results in this segment included $341 million reserve release, compared to a release of $482 million in the fourth quarter and $235 million in the first quarter of \u201913. During the quarter our effective tax rate was impacted by our loss position. For the rest of 2014, we would expect an effective tax rate of approximately 31%, absent any unusual items. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">We\u2019ll make a few comments before we open it up for questions. We obviously don\u2019t like to report a loss to shareholders but this quarter we achieved resolution of rulings around significant legacy matters. FHFA, FGIC, CFPB and OCC, as well as the positive court ruling on Bank of New York Mellon private label securities matters which is under appeal just to name a few. We established additional reserves to help address previously disclosed mortgage related issues and we did that and still built our already strong Basel III standardized capital ratio. Our supplemental leverage ratios at both parent and banks are compliant well and advanced of the 2018 implementation date, under the more stringent new rule.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Our liquidity is at record levels and we\u2019re well positioned to meet the new LTR requirements. Asset quality is strong in improving. Our expense program show good progress and most importantly, four of our five operating segments reported revenue and earnings that were essentially flat or higher than the prior year. In our fifth segment, legacy assets and servicing, we made progress on legacy issues, we drove down 60 days plus delinquent loan and our cost excluding litigation declined $1 billion from last year\u2019s first quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So as we move into the second quarter of this year, we feel that we\u2019re better positioned than we were coming into 2014. And with that we will go ahead and open it up for questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p8\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">(Operator Instructions) And we\u2019ll go first to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Couple of questions. One on the litigation reserve bill that you did in the quarter. You mentioned that FGIC and the trust settlement were fully reserved for. So that means that none of the 2.4 billion increase reserves in 1Q that you called out was for that settlement?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">That\u2019s correct. As we said, substantially all of the $2.4 billion related to a bill in our litigation reserves for matters that we\u2019ve disclosed previously.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And I guess, I\u2019m just wondering, if you could give us a sense or color as to what you\u2019re referring to there. It doesn\u2019t look like it went to the monolines or the PLS. So it is something that\u2019s broadly mortgage related or is it something else? And given that it\u2019s such a large reserve bill, does it suggest that there\u2019s another settlement in the near term?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">You bring up a good point. It does not relate to the previously announced Article 77. It is not relate to the remaining monoline exposure given that we settled the FGIC exposure within the context of our reserve level. So it relates to other mortgage related matters, outside of those that we have disclosed previously.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And I wouldn\u2019t interpret or not fairly assume that the bills and reserve suggest that the settlement is limited.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. Just moving to capital on Basel III, you give us some great information on transitional to the fully phased in walk there and the appendix. I guess I\u2019m just wondering, you did narrow the gap between the standardized and advanced by 30 bps. Could you run through how you did that in the quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Sure. I think if you -- obviously the numerator in both is the same and we saw -- during the quarter we saw improvement in OCI as a numerator and we saw some significant improvement in our threshold deductions. That numerator applies to both standardized as well as the advance approaches. If you look at the standardized risk weighted asset, the big driver down there related to the reduction in our consumer real-estate, both first mortgage, as well as home equity and those portfolios reduced from longer dated assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">In addition, you had the seasonal decline within the card portfolio that helped and that was moderated a little bit by the growth that we saw in commercial loan. So I think as you look at that Basel III standardized ratio, what was driving risk weighted assets were actual reduction in exposure. There wasn\u2019t anything related to models or assumptions that factored into that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">If you move over to the advanced approach, where we reported at 9.9%, which was down a touch, the biggest change and we continue to work with and look to refine and take guidance that we\u2019re getting with respect to operational risk, the operational risk -- the operational risk weighted assets during the quarter as we continue to refine that, we\u2019re up about $50 billion and now represent almost 25% of our overall Basel III advanced risk weighted assets. And I think as you look at relative to our peers, it brings us, and puts us in line with where our peers are with that and we\u2019ll continue to refine it and work through that in the future.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. Just lastly on expenses, you did show a nice reduction in core expenses. Could speak to some of the things that have been hitting the headlines recently, cuts in global markets 5%. Is this accurate? Is it part of new BAC or is it more normal course expense management and then the branches are down 10% over the last two years. How much more optimization is there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I am sorry Betsy; I missed the first part of your question. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">On the global market, the trimming that we did, it was announced as sort of annual term that goes on. Remember we\u2019re -- always we\u2019re adding and we had frankly record hiring from schools this year coming. So we always are, sort of adjusting the headcount, keep the expenses in mind based on -- we have a lot new people join us here, as we go into the summer that we\u2019ve already made offers to and it\u2019s kind of a general betting. So I wouldn\u2019t put that as anything other than just sort of day-to-day expense management and also just a natural turn up in the business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">The second part, Bruce?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yes, on branch optimization as we look at that and I think you really get a sense for the progress within branch optimization when you flip through the consumer and business banking segment. A chunk of that relates to new BAC and you can see over the course of 12 months as we\u2019ve taken the branches down by about 300 units, that\u2019s contributed to on a year-over-year basis a $180 million of expenses that we saw during the quarter. Betsy, so, this is a long term strategy. So whether it\u2019s in the BAC or not, we\u2019ll continue to optimize the platform and what we show you back in the appendix slide is the mobile banking growth is pretty strong.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So at the end of day if you look at it across the last five or six years, we have more customers, a lot more deposits and a lot less cost structure as we reposition to meet the customers\u2019 changing issues of first computers, then phones and the enhanced effectiveness of the ATM. So you should expect that -- those techniques to continue but be that as it may, we also had -- still have 7 million, 7.5 million people coming in our branches every week that are great opportunities to engage with customers that we also continue to see strong foot traffic. So we are managing this to meet those needs from both the people coming to the branch and the people who use the automated techniques and that is the challenge as we go forward. I think we\u2019ve done a pretty good job of bringing them down and keeping the expenses kind of moving with the customer flow.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Great, but from here, this branch level you think holds or you still have more work to do on pulling it down?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">We will adjust it every month and keep looking at it and making adjustments as they look over multiple years in the future. But if you, remember originally we said we get around 5,000 out of new BAC. That was kind of the number we gave you and move there. But also remember that what you define as a branch will change. We have these express branch formats where there is sales people plus what we call ATAs which are ATM machines that you could actually call up -- work with tellers directly. It allows you to cash checks to penny, authenticate without your -- your card is stuck in the machine, with anything to do with a regular teller. And so it\u2019s all important to us. So I think focusing on the numbers of course, the overall cost of this structure -- all the parts is -- and that\u2019s what I focus on. If you look at that we continue to drive that down taking all the cost of the whole infrastructure relative to the deposit base that\u2019s down from down there 200 basis points.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And we\u2019ll go next to Glenn Schorr with ISI. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Looking for a quick comment on the overall loan picture. There is always a lot of puts and takes. So the commercial side grew by 8% year over year. The consumer shrunk by 0.7%. A lot of that\u2019s run off. So can you just give a general comment on how you\u2019re feeling about loan growth and then we\u2019ve been there -- your commentary on the mortgage originations pipeline being up 23% in the first quarter. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Sure. The first is why don\u2019t we start -- if you start with the, within the global banking segment, we saw loans relative to year end up about $2.5 billion and up more significantly on a year-over-year basis and say that we continue to see good loan demand within the commercial space. It\u2019s across both BNI as well as real estate. So we feel good about that. But as I did note, that during the quarter there were certain opportunities and things that we looked at, that we did not do in that we very much have a focus, not just on growing the loans but the return that\u2019s generated from those loans. And I think going forward you should expect to see us grow loans but we\u2019re going to be prudent and it needs to be at returns that make sense and for those customers that we have good relationships with.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">If you move to the consumer side, as I did note and you can see it when you look within the CSBB segment, that the majority of the loan reduction we saw in consumer was really three things. It was the pay-off of first mortgage loans that were held for investment purpose within the investment portfolio. It was the continued reduction within the home equity business where we have about $3.5 billion of home equity loans that repay each quarter but those tend to be older vintages and get back to the home equities we\u2019re doing when it finish and then the third was the overall card balances were down about $4 billion, which on a seasonal basis is what we would expect and we would look to see those card balances stabilize as we go throughout 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">As it relates to new activity, we did note that the pipeline is up about 23%. What we saw was not materially different than others in that the first month, two months of the quarter applications and volume were down with some of the weather but we did see a pickup in that activity which led to -- obviously off of a low base, a 23% increase in the pipeline as we go into the second quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">The other thing I would reference is if you look back, you can see that we have been able to increase and move up what we were doing on the home equity front where we had $2 billion of originations during the quarter. And I would just note from a credit quality perspective, and what we\u2019re seeing there, those loan-to-values tend to be in the 60s with FICO scores deep into the 700. So that area is providing an opportunity for us as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">In some -- I think, I just - I don\u2019t want to put words in your mouth, but if you look at the net of just 50 basis points for total loans, year-on-year, it sounds like it\u2019s better than that just because of the run-off, I just want to make sure that I get that specifics comment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes, especially in the consumer business, the runoff affects the overall numbers. Because remember, we still got the portfolios that we inherited from acquisitions. They are still running through it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Follow up on the legal -- you mentioned the first two were fully reserved for. The 2.4 adds to the reserve. Where are we now in terms of the estimated losses above and beyond what you reserved for? In other words, I would think it could go down as you continue to add further reserve?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Are you referring to the range of possible losses that we disclosed when we put the Q out?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes I think -- we're working through in refining that. We don\u2019t put that out with earnings. We put it out when we file the 10-Q. But to your point, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s - we obviously made progress with getting FHFA put behind us, as well as FGIC and some other related matters and we\u2019re working through where exactly that range of possible loss comes out, but hear your point.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay, I appreciate it. And then last one on slide, I think it\u2019s 14. Just curious, the equity investment income, what\u2019s driving that? It seems to have a nice steady and upward trending slope.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes. As we noted in the script, that we did complete the final monetization of an investment that was a decent chunk of that. So I would not expect to see those revenues at those levels going forward. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And we\u2019ll go next to Jonathan McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Jonathan McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Bruce, I was wondering if -- just want to understand the dynamic of the net interest income outlook. I guess in the second quarter, it\u2019s the increase in lower yielding liquidity on an average basis and that\u2019s going to push the NRI down a little bit. That overwhelms the day count. Is that what\u2019s happening in the second quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes. Keep in mind, you only pick up one day Q1 to Q2. I think you have a couple of things as I mentioned. You\u2019ve got -- relative to first quarter, you do have more card balances given the seasonal bump that you see at year-end that you carry; a fair bit of during the first quarter. We did build up throughout the first quarter, a significant amount of liquidity in anticipation of those rules. That will contribute a little bit to the decline in the second quarter and then as we saw for that you\u2019d expect to see that move up. Nothing structural. We do have some seasonal stuff in the markets business that we do, that depresses things and touch in the second quarter. So as we said it\u2019s obviously early in the quarter but we\u2019re expecting a slight decline, but then we\u2019d expect the trajectory to get back to the levels that we\u2019ve previously talked about. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Jonathan McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay, and what\u2019s helping it grind higher beyond the second quarter, Bruce, just as a reminder? What helps it grow in the third and fourth quarter and beyond?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Sure. I think, as you would look at it, one of the things that we continue to work through is that the debt footprint will come down, although more modestly, but what we are seeing is as we look at the levels at which we raise debt going forward, the cost of that has come down significantly. So you have some pickup there. You obviously have some pickup with some of the loan growth that we\u2019re seeing within the commercial space and we continue to take deposit pricing down as well, although we\u2019re down to levels that are harder to get much lower. And I do just want to remind you Jon, and I know you know this that as we give this guidance, it\u2019s backed up and it excludes market related impacts that come out of FAS 91.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Jonathan McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay, and then on litigation expense, Bruce, with the big reserve build and the settlements this quarter, what\u2019s the outlook there? I know it\u2019s tough to forecast. But should we assume that a few hundred million of litigation expense will process through the next several quarters?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I think you have to look between -- we've continued and I just reminded -- as you look at the litigation pipeline and you look at where we are; we\u2019ve obviously gotten through the base rep and warrant with respect to the GSEs. We were able to get through and reach an agreement with FGIC, which is the fourth monoline settlement that we have. And then we are working through in the Article 77 case that is going through the judicial process. So as we continue to reduce the number of outstanding litigation items that we have, that should obviously bode well for what I would characterize as the kind of base litigation expense. That being said, I think we need to be realistic and you saw it this quarter that as it relates to the remaining couple of matters that we disclosed, it can be lumpy in that it\u2019s just very hard to predict. But as we talked about it in the presentation, during the quarter we did have a pretty significant build as we continue to evaluate those positions, as well as the discussions that we have, that our parties do the litigation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Jon I think the simple way. If you think about things that -- litigation matters that sort of arise after \u201808, \u201909, the cost of those are very modest, anything new exist. These all cost really relates to the stuff before the price [indiscernible] cleanup. So your point about what would be ongoing litigation, trust me, much, much lower but the question is the lumpiness refers to the transition we got left on a few of these matters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Jonathan McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay, and then Bruce just to clarify the provision commentary that you made. Your outlook is for net charge offs to kind of grind lower modestly but -- and reserve release to continue but probably at a smaller level than the 380 we saw this quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes, I think that\u2019s fair Jon. It can bounce around in any one quarter but the provision number, broadly speaking is in line with what we\u2019d expect over the next couple of quarters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So Jon, another way is if you look at the supplemental material and the pages on the charge offs by product. You got to remember that there is - if you look at the credit card charge offs in U.S. and domestic, they\u2019re down. This quarter was 700 million and 3.25% charge off rate. You are kind of hitting a place where the business is geared to have some amount of charge offs and it\u2019s the way the business works, part of the cost of doing business as a credit cost. If you look outside that number, that is -- card charge offs are like 80% of the charge offs, 60% 70% of charge offs, and they are going to be hard to get down a lot more. So there is work to do on mortgage charge offs, home equity charge offs. If you look across the rest of the board, they\u2019re in pretty good shape.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Jonathan McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And last thing from me; just wondering if trading and fixed income in particular, do they have any notable sequential trends in the quarter? Did trading get better in March and early April as rate volatility started to pick up a little bit or anything like that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I wouldn\u2019t highlight any real seasonality of note as it relates to drastic ups or downs throughout the quarter. The one piece that I would say that I think generally rates in foreign exchange, given where the market was in the back that there was not a lot of volatility in the quarter was clearly negatively affected. And on the positive side I would say that the overall credit trading businesses, whether it be loans, high grade bond trading or high yield bond trading, given market activity levels as well as our position from an underwriting perspective, were very strong during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And we\u2019ll go next to Paul Miller with FBR. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Thomas LeTrent - FBR</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">This is Thomas LeTrent on behalf of Paul. Another sort of expense theme question; there has obviously been an increased amount of regulatory scrutiny on MSR transfers. Can you touch for me a little bit, whether, if those transactions got delayed or pushed out, if it would impact your ability to meet expense targets or just a little color there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">A very good question. What I would point out is, and if you go back to the fourth quarter of 2012, that was when we announced our significant MSR transfers. And so if you look at where we are, as it relates to just pure MSR transfers or through the significant majority of what we would expect, we\u2019ve got some clean up and far smaller ones during the second quarter, third quarter and fourth quarters. We don\u2019t have any reason to believe, given they\u2019re small and who they\u2019re going to, that there\u2019ll be a problem with the transfer. So we feel, and as it relates to getting to the expense targets with what\u2019s left to go, that will not be an issue for us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">We\u2019ll go next to Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Ken Usdin - Jefferies</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I wanted to ask you about just operating leverage and again expense progress. So year-over-year revenues plus or minus were down $1 billion and if I\u2019m looking at Slide 7, I\u2019m looking at -- the core expenses were down a few hundred million and that\u2019s net of all the New BAC benefits. So can you talk to us about just the push and pull between the net BFA -- the New BFA, New BAC reductions and then what cost inflation you\u2019re seeing any underneath the core. And then as you look forward, just how we should expect that core line to traject, the \u201813 excluding the retirement eligible?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Sure let me answer the last of your question first, which is we would expect the core trajectory to trend down as we go throughout 2014. When you look at the, and if you\u2019re looking on Slide 7 and we compare the $13.8 billion to the $13.6 billion, let me just consider and give you a couple of numbers that affected that core.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">During the first quarter of \u201914, as we continue to reduce headcount, we incurred over a $100 million of severance expense on both an absolute basis as well as a year-over-year basis within those numbers. So you had a $100 million to the negative there. The second thing is and as we disclosed, we have been investing within corporate banking, cash management sales people, to a lesser extent capital markets people and some of the technology that goes along with that and we think as we look going forward, we\u2019re through a lot of that investment but as I referenced in my comments, I would ask you to flip back up to page 26 because we are seeing the benefit from revenue growth from those investments and we\u2019d obviously expect those to moderate going forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">The other couple of things that I would note there is if you look at within the wealth management business, you need to consider within that area that we did have $200 million plus increase in revenue from asset management fees. So there\u2019s obviously compensation that goes out with that as well as some of the technology dollars that were spent for our Merrill 1 project that we rolled out within the wealth management area. So I would just say, as you look at that 200, the benefit from New BAC was clearly on a year-over-year, much more significant from that. But we are investing in the areas where we think and where we\u2019re seeing revenue growth and we would obviously expect those investments, given that they\u2019ve been made and are generating the revenues that you\u2019d expect those to moderate going forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Ken Usdin - Jefferies</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And just a follow-up to that then, we are going to continue to see improvements to get to that 2 billion New BAC level by mid-next year. But given what you anticipate on the revenue side, do you feel that that\u2019s enough to get you where you want to go in terms of profitability improvement or is there anything you can contemplate or need to contemplate as far as finding other incremental ways to fund those investments or drive more to the bottom line?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Obviously we continue to look at that and we continue, we started after this, as you know in \u201811 and so if you go back, I think we had $80 odd billion expenses when we started this thing and so we\u2019ve been driving it down year after year after year. But that doesn\u2019t mean it stops at New BAC. It\u2019s just the challenge inherent in the slow growth environment is how to manage the relative investment rate, expense growth rate versus revenue growth rate. And so that\u2019s something we as management continue to focus on.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">But if you think about the $13.6 billion and think about continue make some improvement against it, sort of annualize that add back, whatever $1 billion to the one time retirement cost and then some litigation, you start to get into levels that we think are consistent with the earnings, sort of restoring the normalized earnings pool. The question is, and you are right is that we got to make sure that the investments we make are yielding the revenue benefits and we got to keep the total expenses overall and that\u2019s we are up to. And I think the way to think about that is, look at 3,500 more employees\u2019 headcount reduction this quarter and you\u2019ll continue to see that work its way down. That is a leading indicator of what\u2019s going to happen next quarter because those employees, that the spot-to-spot number went out during the quarter but they\u2019re still on the payroll for the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Ken Usdin - Jefferies</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Got it. And one last one, just card income and service charges -- a lot of other banks have been seeing weakness there, partially weather, partially regulatory, partial pricing changes. Anything that you guys are seeing or anticipate seeing on any of those fronts looking ahead?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">If you think about the longer term trend there, we had a big change in terms of fee structures in the consumer business, broadly going back a few years ago and you kind of came through all that and that affected. What\u2019s happened now as if you just look at our card activity, our purchases on our cards are up by 5% or so quarter to last year this quarter -- first quarter last year to first quarter this year. So, we continue to see better than market growth in the activity levels -- general spending levels and things like that -- which helps them interchange that once we got off, sort of the reduction that were due to the change in interchange rules, and so I think they\u2019ll keep driving forward based on just general activity but most of the real down draft came out in \u201811, \u201812, early \u201813 timeframe.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yes, I think the other point is, if you look at within the consumer business, we actually saw the service charges during the quarter were up about 3% on a year-over-year basis. So some of the card income tends to be seasonally higher in the fourth quarter. It dropped in the first quarter then builds back up but within the consumer space we were pleased with what we saw on the service charge line during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So, if you go back and look at 17, we got, we have been producing from a sort of 700,000 to 800,000 run rate new cards to a 1 million plus and those cards are being used as a core card by the customers, in such driving up -- the pay rate is still high. So the balances aren\u2019t moving much but the activity underneath is moving and we\u2019re still replacing some affinity portfolios that we sold and things like that. So our view is that the transactional behavior of our customers continues to grow and will benefit some of the fee lines too. </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">We\u2019ll go next to Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">First, just a couple of follow ups. So how much of the new BAC savings were achieved by the end of the quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">You should look at relative to the $2 billion a quarter. We\u2019re in the $1.7 billion area.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">All right, so you have $300 million left per quarter to be achieved by mid-2015?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">That\u2019s correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. And then the LAS savings, you have another $500 million a quarter to be achieved by the end of the year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">That\u2019s correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">All right. So, $800 million total quarterly expense savings we should expect over the next year or so. So, should we expect all that to hit the bottom line?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">You should expect it to hit the bottom line with just the one caveat, that to the extent that there are revenue related things that have cost attached to them that could moderate that reduction but ultimately that would be a positive to the pre-tax income line.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. And do you have an efficiency target for the firm? Because I\u2019m just looking at Page 3 of the supplement and the efficiency ratio is kind of thrown off by the charges and it\u2019s been in the 70s the last few quarters and 97.68%, I don\u2019t think you consider that your core efficiency ratio. So what do you consider your core efficiency ratio and where should it be and where you hope to get -- when do you hope to get there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I think if you go back and look at what we talked about in the fourth quarter, where we talked about where we\u2019d like to get to from an ROA return on tangible common equity and we talked about once rate started to move up that and as we looked out, we look out in a couple of years, that efficiency ratio should be in the high 50s.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. So do you have a specific time frame for that or just when rates go up?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I think as we look at it, it\u2019s just at a point in time that rates are up roughly 100 basis points across the curve and obviously to the extent that we don\u2019t see rates move up, we\u2019re going to need to run harder on expenses to try to get it to the extent that the rate environment doesn\u2019t move up.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Shifting gears, the tax rate excluding the mortgage charge to the first quarter was what?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I believe it was roughly I guess about 50% -- somewhere between 58% and 60%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I\u2019m sorry the tax rate? You said the tax rate going ahead will be 31%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Right.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I\u2019m just trying to figure out, what was the core tax rate for this quarter, excluding the charge?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">It would be -- I mean the core tax rate we project out and look out over the years. Still the core would have been 31, but you always have a little bit of noise when you -- and obviously it was a pretax loss but the discrete item always kind of overwhelms things a low period. But the base rate from which you\u2019re starting from is 31% and it was just a little bit skewed given what we saw from a pretax loss perspective.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. You had record wealth management for the quarter, and one of the online brokers recently said that the big brokerage firms are doing better. How much do you attribute the record wealth management to the environment versus what you\u2019re doing versus it\u2019s better to be a big broker?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I\u2019m not sure what the context is Mike but the net flows in the wealth management business were around $11 billion -- $12 billion this quarter which was nearly 17 to 18 due to long term flows and $6 billion of short term liquidity flows out for net of around $12 billion. If you look in the Merrill Edge platform, which is more akin to the sort of the online type of thing, I think we had 80,000 plus to account this quarter. We asked continue to grow and top to 100 billion daily average trades are up I think 25% to 30% year-over-year. And so it continues to progress and we continue to see good asset flows there too. So big, small, large, traditional, all that sort of blended together, we operate as a core consolidated franchise you\u2019re seeing good momentum in both.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">You\u2019re allocating more capital at GWIM as well as global banking and global markets. Is that increased capital allocation due to regulatory capital changes or a deliberate move by you guys to invest more for growth in those segments?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Well, let me just start -- the allocation of capital is how we think the capital that we have the Company and push it out to the businesses - I think you need to go segment by segment within that Mike. I think the first is that as you look at the global banking segment and look at the allocation and what we\u2019ve done, the first is on a year-over-year basis you had average loans up about $30 billion. So there were more loan balances against which you need to allocate capital. The second thing that I would say is as you look at that segment and you consider Basel III standardized ratios, they tend to risk weight almost all commercial loans at 100% regardless of what the models would suggest they should be risk weighted at.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So I think the combination of the loan growth, along with some of the impacts from regulatory capital led us to increase what we did with respect to global banking. Within global wealth management, as you go back and refine operational loss models and assign operational risk capital, that was topped up as well as reflecting the fact within wealth management business that we\u2019ve seen loan growth within that segment. So there was additional money allocated there and then as we look at and just continue to refine and look at both comparables as well as asset mix, we thought it was prudent to increase modestly what we saw with a global market and as I said in my comments, when you consider the aggregate and we look at where we are relative to peers, we\u2019ve got virtually all of our capital at this point pushed out to the different businesses which is the way it should be.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I agree. So it sounds like it\u2019s partly business growth and partly regulatory related and partly a desire simply to have less unallocated capital.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I think the last one is what you got to keep up.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay and then lastly, the Bank of New York ruling was good. I did not expect that, but you still had a $6 billion charge this quarter and another $2.4 billion extra charge in the last 15 workdays since the FHFA amount was announced and I know you\u2019ve had several questions in the call but what\u2019s left as far as potential legal charges, because the teams are so lumpy and if in just a few weeks you can have another $2.4 billion charge seemingly out of the blue for some of us, what\u2019s left?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I think when you look at it, as I commented that I think we give fairly wholesome disclosure in the 10-K as it relates to the matters that are out there and when you look at the matters and compare where we are now to what\u2019s out there, that obviously from the case that FHFA was resolved and that was the $3.6 billion number we mentioned. You\u2019ve seen resolutions during the quarter from an Allstate RMBS perspective. You saw a resolution of force-placed lace insurance. You saw CFPB/OCC, and you saw the deal that we completed and announced with FGIC today. So as you work through and look at those matters it\u2019s largely with what\u2019s disclosed leaves you with respect to one monoline and then in addition to the monoline, the other remaining legacy mortgage related matters that we put out in our disclosure.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">We\u2019ll go next to Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Let me just start out by saying on the litigation front, I actually thought it was very good that you\u2019ve provided now for a bunch of the issues that are actually still pretty visible out there. So let\u2019s just a thank you for having done that. I have a question for you on the control environment cost. Some of your competitors, JPMorgan and Citi have spoken to you know billion dollar type numbers for increased control environment cost in the wake of CCAR issues over the last few years and obviously all of the -- the heightened scrutiny and I was wondering if you could give us a sense for what your control cost increase has been over the last year or two.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I\u2019ll give you a number, let me give you a way to think about it. In our environment, coming out of the same issues in \u201908 and \u201909, we built a lot of personnel and headcount to get after the stuff and we\u2019re still finishing up to clean up and so if you look in the expense base, a lot of that\u2019s been in the expense base for a couple of years and then and so if you think about something like our audit team, we doubled the size of our audit team probably in 2010 and it\u2019s been held fairly constant against that. Against the back drop, we probably divested tons of businesses and the rest of the headcount the Company has come down you know fairly dramatically from a high of 305,000 I think.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So the amount of control environment relative to the total cost structure has gone up but the raw numbers haven\u2019t gone up as dramatically because frankly we put a lot of men in \u201910 - \u201811 timeframe. So it is our duty to get it right. It\u2019s our duty to keep working on it and make sure that we get these things right to the ground but one of the key ways that we\u2019re doing this is by focusing the scope of the Company. So the fourth place, excuse me, the add on products build up this quarter, we quit offering those products a while ago. It just took a while with the OCC and the consumer bureau to finish up the negotiations and finish up the rebate. We\u2019ve been sending money back to customers, but we quit offering the products as an example and so the idea of narrowing the products, that\u2019s narrowing the geographic scope of the Company, making the Company a lot less complex. We\u2019ll always be big but we make ourselves less complex, but against that a growing -- a strong growth in the control cost in the \u20189-\u201810-\u201811 timeframe and in the flattening of that, but relative to smaller companies is actually an increase.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"> </p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Thanks. That\u2019s helpful color, certainly in terms of thinking about the timing. You did allude to some increase in technology investment in GWIM and obviously the margin there contracted a little bit. Maybe you can give us a little bit of a sense for what this - I think you alluded to Merrill One?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Well, Merrill One is a new product they brought out that\u2019s been successful and like anything else, you put the product after you\u2019ve spent all the money to put the product together and the assets come on it. And so we are feeling good about that, tens of billions of dollars of that\u2019s been moved to the platform. It is a good platform for customers and for the advisors.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I think more broadly I talked about technology. If you looked at the expenses we had going back, sort of at the prices, we saw the Merrill transition expenses and all in we\u2019re spending around $3 billion in technology development a year. We now spend about 3.5 billion. And then obviously the transition expenses are out there. So everything we\u2019re spending is to better the platform, better the business, invest in the growth.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And again some of your questions about cost, that number, I don\u2019t expect to change going forward because it takes that kind of technology investment to drive the product capabilities of our company; Merrill One being one product this quarter along with a new card system, a new trading platform. Tom and his team are in the middle of putting in a new backbone for the Company in terms of our general accounting systems, which has been the tailwind going in and across the board. So across a four five year format, the timeframe will replace almost every system in the Company, but we would expect that to continue.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">So the GWIN, we swung around, last we did more in other businesses cash management, we started building -- rebuilt the front end mortgage process and a lot of other things. This year we swung the GWIN and it\u2019s really a decision of which business we invest in at which time and they ask more investment this year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And then final one for me. You gave the leverage ratios being above the 5% and the 6% requirements based on the most recent NPR. Subsequent to that -- I guess Basel came out in March with some suggested changes to the netting on a standardized basis for counter party credit and I was wondering if you have any sense at this point, what the impact on the leverage ratio would be of those changes if implemented.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I think the final supplementary leverage ratio rules that reflected that came out in April and so the numbers that we\u2019ve given you where we\u2019re above the 5% were 6% at the bank, reflects the impact of those rules with respect to netting and the other changes. The numbers we have given you reflect that April release.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">That\u2019s from the Fed right, the April release from the Fed?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">That\u2019s correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">No. What I was referring to is that Basel had come out with something in March, which one would assume that eventually the Fed will adopt for the standardized approach to counter party credit, and I think JPM alluded on Slide 8 to the idea that could add depending on whether you look at the whole Company, whether the holding company or the bank units upwards of 20 basis points to the leverage ratio because it takes into account the net integrated expense. I was wondering if you had done any preliminary work on that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I think, I we\u2019ll say that our focus has been on wrapping up the work, given what the April pronouncement is. I\u2019m not -- my understanding was that the Fed, I think what came out in April is what we\u2019re assuming that we\u2019re going to need to operate in and there is something else that changes whether the benefit that\u2019s great. But our assumption is we\u2019re going to be living on what came out on April 8th.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">We\u2019ll go next to Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">If I could just follow up on the net interest income comment, I guess just bigger picture. It seems like the outlook is a little bit lower than what you had previously thought? And I just want to think about building liquidity tends to be dilutive to NIM but not net interest income dollars. Some of the things you point to are seasonal. So just like big picture, as we think about where you had thought NII [ph] might be a couple of quarters ago looking out -- what\u2019s worse? Is it more run off than you thought? Less loan growth because you\u2019re tightening up versus what some others are doing or is it just the rates haven\u2019t moved at all or some combination of all that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I\u2019d make a couple of points. If you go back -- the guidance that we\u2019ve given is that we\u2019ve lined up from roughly $10.5 billion number and as we look out to third quarter and fourth quarter, that\u2019s what we see in our numbers. I do think there have been, relative to -- if you go back two, three, four quarters ago, several things that have changed. The first is that as we\u2019ve worked hard to get in the position that we\u2019re in from an LCR perspective, we have -- LCR but with the rate environment that we\u2019re managing the OCI risk that we have directed more of the investment portfolio to shorter daily treasuries, is mortgage backed securities and as you go out over a couple of quarters, that has a negative impact.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">The second thing, as you look at where we are and you look at the forward curve, our assumptions on what yields are going to be that we can reinvest in outside of the switch and mix, obviously those yields have not moved to the extent that the forward curves would have suggested at that point. And I would say generally with respect to the loan portfolio, I wouldn\u2019t say there is much change. I do think that the one thing to note that we\u2019ve not talked about, if you look at within our global banking segment, this is the first quarter in a while where we\u2019ve actually see the loan pricing spread stabilize and actually in certain of the portfolios move up at touch. So that\u2019s a positive. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything to your question -- that material that there are just some small things here and there and we wanted to update and share our thoughts with what we thought the second quarter would be but longer term I think we\u2019re still in the same place as far as the 10.5 [ph] grinding up.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay. And then just switching topics on the core LAS cost. So ex all the litigation, you iterated the target for year-end, I think of about a $1 billion or $1.1 billion. Still feel good about the $500 million per quarter late next year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And is that something that we could see overshoots the downside like we\u2019re seeing in charge-offs. Obviously like credit is getting much better than a lot of us would have thought a couple of years ago. Do you think those core LAS cost end up just being much lower than expected once you work through all the issues?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I just said, I hope so, but I wouldn\u2019t. Let\u2019s just get it down to that level and we\u2019ll figure out what we can do from there. I mean its arduous task and there\u2019s still lot of work at it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay. And then just lastly on SLR again, just care to provide any more details in terms of how much above 5%, how much above 6% roughly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">So I would say that, we\u2019ve said we\u2019re above 5%. We\u2019ve said that. Assuming that Buffett preferred amendment gets done, that adds up to another 10 basis points, which obviously move this up. And you can assume that the only other guidance that says that -- the bank ratio relative to the limit is stronger than where we are with the parent today but once again, the Buffett amendment will help.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">We will go next to Marty Mosby with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Marty Mosby - Guggenheim</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Thank you. Three questions. One is operational risk you talked about, and that represents about 25% of your risk weighted asset. So in doing that and in the past, that is very sticky and how do you think you can manage around the amount of capital just been trapped with the fact of all these past settlements that you had to kind of live through?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Yes. Your point Marty is a good one, which is the operational risk model are based on a fairly long time series as we look at it. And one of the things that we do, continue to try to discuss this stress is that, a lot of those operational risk losses are with respect to activity that we no longer engage and have no intention to engage. So there are some of that dialog that continue but your point which is a fair one is that the time series are fairly long and it will remain out there and till the data runs out and I wish there was more that I can say but your point is a fair one.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Marty Mosby - Guggenheim</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Is the only true way, is it almost disembarked from mortgage because there were so much in that particular area. The only way to clean it up is to say maybe if that\u2019s all related to those mortgage settlement -- mortgage related settlement, it\u2019s just not worth carrying that baggage going forward, even though it wasn\u2019t really your fault. It was the country wide legacy more than it was your own operations.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">I think your point Marty is the one that we\u2019re working through, and in fact we\u2019ve done like you suggested that we\u2019ve done and this is if you look at those activities that led to those losses, we are no longer engaged in those activities. If you look out at -- we are not doing business with monolines from a new rep perspective. You look at private label securitization. That activity with rep and warrant is not continuing. So we think we\u2019ve largely done that and I think the question just going forward is, if you\u2019ve proven and you clearly are outside of the activity, is there any release to be had, not the way that it worked now, we\u2019ll just have to work through and deal with it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Marty Mosby - Guggenheim</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Got you. Secondly, you called out that mortgage servicing hedging was unfavorable this quarter. If you kind of look at the environment, it seemed like I\u2019ve seen in others that it was actually a positive, not a negative. What was in particular happening in your mortgage servicing hedging?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">There was really nothing. I think the comment that we made was that the question of the hedging performance this quarter relative to a year ago. So the hedging was still a positive number. It was just less so on a year-over-year basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Marty Mosby - Guggenheim</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Got you. And then lastly, when you think about moving from your mortgage backed securities into agencies and treasuries that have shorter durations, that\u2019s kind of throwing you to become more assets sensitive. Are you thinking about -- because liquidity rules are making the balance sheet become more asset sensitive, employing more interest rates swaps or off balance sheet hedging to rebalance and not become so much more effort sensitive vis-\u00e0-vis other pressures.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">If you go back, we have been pretty consistent at the -- the reason for the investment portfolio is to preserve the long-term value of the deposit and as you look at that portfolio, it\u2019s very clear there are only three things that we do within that portfolio. There is treasury security, there\u2019s agency security and there is AA and AAA super-sovereign type activities. And as it relates to becoming a little bit more asset sensitive, we just think, given the first and you\u2019ve seen a large portion of it happen that -- just to drive and get to the point we have with LCR, the shift in the portfolio helped this quarter. It has the same benefit as I said of shrinking and reducing your OCI risk as you go through this and we\u2019re not interested in starting to try to do things from a derivative and other perspective that somehow changed that. The investment portfolio needs the work with how we set it up and we\u2019re going to be prudent with respect to how we do it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Operator </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">And we will go next with Nancy Bush with NAB Research LLC. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Nancy Bush - NAB Research LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Question on the mortgage business. I think there was an article on The Wall Street Journal this morning or somewhere that the business is getting off to a slower start than we would have thought, given the spring bounce back that was expected from the winter weather. Has there been any rethinking Brian on sort of the eventual size and direction of the mortgage business there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Nancy we kind of did that in 2011. We got out of all but direct-to-consumer. So basically we have focused a business on really supporting the core customer base and not trying to drive standalone market shares in the scheme of things. And so what has happened to that is that as we sold off the non-core servicing, we\u2019ve gotten down to a significant less number of loans serviced and the originations, $10 billion just quarter, all direct-to-consumer which is a second highest total in the country, direct-to-consumer mortgages. So, I think we are comfortable where we are. Now the question is with the LAS aside, the core business, what does it look like and it will be a small business, smaller business, it will generate customer, mortgages for our customers because it\u2019s the core product they need but also that sales force quite frankly sells other products and does other things for us, refers people for other products.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">So, I think that the days of being a 20% market share and suffer far behind is the days of being 4% market share direct-to-consumer and growing there. And we will make some money in it and we will make some money servicing those four loans to delinquencies, just those six and those on what we have been doing and that are far superior to even what we would have predicted and that\u2019s how we run the business. So effectively we\u2019ve done what you said. It\u2019s just we\u2019re still sort of down by the overhang of effectively -- the LAS portfolio is still working through the system and 300,000 delinquent mortgages of which only about -- the delinquency of the core portfolio is about 50,000, 60,000.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Nancy Bush - NAB Research LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Also could you make sort of a similar pronouncement about the card business? Where you stand in terms of chair and growth right now and are you where you want to be?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">That\u2019s different in a sense that on the card side, we actually took it down unfortunately through charge-offs and might [ph] have been more than not but I think we have been relatively consistent on a domestic piece around $90 odd billion of outstanding and kind of grinding up and down from there and producing more cards that are coming out of the wall first from our customer from 700,000 we showed you two years ago first quarter to million plus this quarter and pretty consistently with a 1 million plus the third quarter of almost a 1 million in the fourth quarter, another 1 million plus this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">But the total we see there is actually usage of those cards. They sold 60% plus to our primary customers but also the usage of the card because of the core three or four card product is driving it and we have some affiliate programs. I think the card business is likewise. It is where we want it but it\u2019s a bit more of a payment stream business than it is a pure lending business as it was in the some of the past. So the balances ought to be stable and ought to grow but with the high quality portfolio the payments rates in the 20s now -- I mean people pay us off because they are using the transaction card.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Nancy Bush - NAB Research LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">And just finally, Bruce you have indicated that net interest income is going to decline somewhat due to liquidity issues et cetera. Is that same going to be true of the NIM or is there anything in the mix change coming in the near term that can send the NIM up from -- the adjusted NIM up from this 236 level?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">I think we said that we thought that the core NII ex-market related impact to be down slightly in the second quarter and then grow modestly through the rest of the year. What you will see in the second quarter given that you have the full quarter -- the liquidity that\u2019s on the book, you would expect to see that the NIM in the second quarter moderate a little bit, given that you\u2019ve got the full quarter of the liquidity and then obviously as it starts to grow during the latter half of the year, you\u2019d expect the NIM to follow that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">And that\u2019s the overall, now that we have better insight as to what these rules are, we don\u2019t have to go back and go get 7% common equity ratio, so we have very strong common equity ratio. We have to go back and sort of look at, Bruce and I think, with the rules now in hand, you can start to go work and say okay, how do we optimize the next round because in terms of how we create maximum liquidity per dollar balance sheet of that size, right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Operator</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">And we will take our last question from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research; please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Two quick. Just first on home equity net charge-off, I guess if you exclude the TDR impact last quarter, they were up. And so we\u2019re home equity NPLs. You just sort of walk through what\u2019s going on there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Sure. There were two things that Jim banged us up -- good question -- to the tune of about $50 million each. And there were some home-equity stuff that we just rolled up, that was going to have foreclosure cost, that were greater than what it was going to be worth to try to get repaid. So that happened during the quarter. And then the second thing is there was some regulatory guidance that was given as it related to second lien loans that will be high and first lien that have been modified or charged-off, that we saw during the quarter. We think we got most of it in this quarter. There maybe a little bit left in the second quarter. But it\u2019s a good question; that those two items, banged us up to the tune of about $100 million and that was the reason for the change.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"> <strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Okay, that\u2019s helpful and then, just on the investment banking pipeline, any commentary?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">I think what we see is, the overall markets continue to be strong. The pipeline and the amount of activity in discussions from an M&amp;A perspective is encouraging. And I would say as we go forward that -- we talked about, we felt the pipeline was strong at the end of the year, and as we look at the pipeline, it did not change materially, one way or the other at the end of the first quarter versus the end of the year. And as we said, we feel very good about the quarter with revenue side being north of a $1.5 billion and the highest than any firm that has reported at this point.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Thank you very much everyone for joining and we\u2019ll talk to you next quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Operator</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">This does conclude today\u2019s conference.

And welcome to the Bank of America Earnings Announcement Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode, but later you\u2019ll have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. Please note that this call is being recorded.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">It\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Lee McEntire. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Lee McEntire</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning. Thanks to everyone on the phone, as well as webcast for joining us this morning for the first quarter results. Hopefully, everybody had a chance to review the earnings release documents that are available on the website.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Before I turn the call over to Brian and Bruce, let me just remind you, we may make forward-looking statements. For further information on those, please refer to either our earnings release documents, our website or other SEC filings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">So, with that, let me turn it over to Brian Moynihan, our CEO for some opening comments, before Bruce goes through the details. Brian?</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you, Lee. And good morning and welcome everyone to the earnings call for our first quarter of 2015. I am going to start on slide two. So the highlights are there. We earned $3.4 billion after tax in the quarter, which is up both on a linked quarter and year-over-year basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We continue to work to drive growth in all our core businesses. We will begin to see it overcome the runoff at non-core portfolios in many areas. At the same time, we continue to focus on managing expenses carefully. As a result, we\u2019ve begin to see more predictable earnings with more improvement expected ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Both capital and liquidity remained at record levels in our company. We expect to return more capital to shareholders this year than we have in the past.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Revenue on adjusted bases was $21.9 billion for the quarter. From the top of the house revenues remains challenging in an environment with below trend economic growth and rate environment which comes from that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">In addition, we remained faithful to our customer\u2019s strategy with strong risk management and risk appetite to ensure we do not repeat the outsized credit losses of the past. With that said, we are seeing our core business stabilizing across the drivers of the revenue.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">This quarter we saw continued growth in our Wealth Management revenues and rebounds in the fourth quarter in trading revenues. In our loan and deposit areas we saw continued core growth albeit subject to continued spread contraction.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Our expense management efforts continue. Year-over-year expenses excluding litigation costs are down 6%, including litigation costs, year-over-year expenses are down 30%. We continue to see our efficiency efforts drive forward beyond new BAC through our simplified and improved program.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We also continue to see progress on LAS expense. As proof of our efforts for the quarter we ended with our headcount at 200 -- little under 220,000 full time employees, a reduction of 4,000 employees for the quarter about 2% and 19,000 employees year-over-year or 8%. For the quarter this reduction came to about 35% from LAS and about 65% from the rest of the company.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">To put it in a broad context, we are approaching employment levels, where we were in early 2008, prior to bringing over -- in over 100,000 people from Countrywide and Merrill acquisitions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We are doing that through the investments we are making in technology to reduce costs and they continue to take hold, and we will continue to drive this effort even as economy continues to improve and rates raise helping keep balance to our operating leverage.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">During the last year, even though we are reducing those costs and headcount, we continue to invest in the client facing growth capacity in this company. We have added financial advisors in U.S. Trusts and in Merrill Lynch focused on building for the future.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We have added commercial bankers in all our Global Banking areas to help fill in our franchise. We have added new financial centers in areas of opportunity and we continue to invest in products and innovation, as well as efficiency. A simple example, in our Consumer Mobile Banking space, we now have 70 million mobile banking customers up over 2 million from last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Turning to slide three, you can see what we simply need to do. Each of the four core lines of businesses on the left hand part of the slide earned above our cost-of-capital for this quarter. In addition, the aggregate earnings for all those businesses were $4.4 billion after tax. The LAS segment had a much smaller loss this quarter, showing we are making progress.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">The other area on the right hand of the slide effected this quarter by the impacts of retirement eligible incentive costs in the market related NII adjustment which affect the top of the house earnings. They booked their distributed business over the quarters, what that shows that we need to keep working LAS to get it to breakeven and the other will take care of itself in subsequent quarters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Turning to slide four, with regard to CCAR. As previously disclosed, we received a conditional non-objection to our capital plan. We received the approval for our request to capital actions that we request in our original submission, a dividend of $0.05 per share and $4 billion of stock repurchase on the relevant periods.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">As you can see, the cushion we have increased from about $2 billion last year under the tightest constraint to over $22 billion this year, in both those cases under the tightest constraint after all capital actions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">These quantitative results bode well. However, the conditional approval is an area with which we are focusing. We will focus our energy for the September resubmission and beyond.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Our efforts are well underway. We are bringing additional resources to task. We simply have to be the best at CCAR to meet our shareholder objectives and our company. To ensure that we achieve that success I\u2019d have asked Terry Laughlin to lead our efforts. As many of you know, Terry helped us clear up the mortgage issues over the last several years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">I can assure you that our Board management are extremely focused on our resubmission and our core process improvement for CCAR 2016 next year. Terry has retained the team external experts, increase internal staffing to ensure we are successful. We\u2019ve had in-depth discussion with our regulators regarding the particulars specified issues that we need to re-immediate with the resubmission and we are focused on getting that done by September.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">With that, I\u2019ll turn now over to Bruce.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I am going to start on slide five. As Brian mentioned, we recorded $3.4 billion of earnings in the first quarter or $0.27 per diluted share. That compares to $0.25 a share in the fourth quarter of 2014 and a loss of $0.05 if we go back to the first quarter of 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">I\u2019d like to note a few items as you review these results. Both first quarter periods include $1 billion in expense for the annual cost of retirement eligible incentives awarded. This was $0.06 in EPS impact in each of the first quarter periods.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">The first quarter of 2015 also includes a negative market related adjustments to net interest income of $484 million for the acceleration of bond premium amortization on our debt securities that\u2019s driven by lower long-term rates. That costs us $0.03 in EPS during the quarter. The other large item that\u2019s worth noting as you look at the comparisons is the outsized litigation amount of $6 billion in the first quarter of 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">I\u2019d like to spend just a moment on total revenue comparisons, our first quarter of 2015 revenue on an FTE basis. If we exclude the market-related adjustment to NII and a small DVA adjustment was $21.9 billion during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">If we compared that to the fourth quarter of 2014 and adjust for the same items, revenue is up $1.7 billion or 8% and that 8% increase is attributable to rebound in sales and trading results, as well as higher Mortgage Banking income and is offset somewhat by lower net interest income mostly from two fewer days during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">If we compare back to the first quarter of \u201914 and we further adjust for $800 million in equity investment gains as a result of monetizing a single strategic investment in a year ago period, revenue is down a couple $100 million or 1% and that\u2019s from lower net interest income and lower sales and trading results.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Total non-interest expense during the quarter was $15.7 billion and included the $1 billion in retirement eligible costs, as well as $370 million in litigation expense. I will go through that the comparisons from an expense perspective several slides back.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">As we look at provision for credit losses during the quarter, they were $765 million and included $429 million in reserve release versus $660 million in the fourth quarter of 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Preferred dividends during the first quarter were $382 million and as you all looked to update your models given the preferred issuances that we have had the majority of which paid semiannually as you look at preferred dividends they should be roughly $330 million in the second and fourth quarters, and $440 million in the first and third quarters going forward based on our existing preferred footprint.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Let\u2019s go ahead and move to slide six on the balance sheet, our balance sheet was up slightly to $2.14 trillion and that was driven almost exclusively by cash balances associated with the deposit growth that we saw during the quarter. We continued our focus on balance sheet optimization for the liquidity, as we continue to shift some of our discretionary portfolio first lien loans into HQLA eligible securities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Loans on a period end basis were down modestly, reflecting good core loan activity in both our Global Banking, as well as our Wealth Management segments that was more than offset by seasonally lower cad balances in our discretionary consumer real estate area, as well as runoff portfolios.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Deposits were up $34 billion or 3% from the end of the year and some of that, obviously, I have to do with seasonal tax activity. We issued $3 billion of preferred stock in the quarter that benefited regulatory capital and as you look at common shareholders\u2019 equity you can see it improved driven both by earnings growth, as well as improved OCI. As a result of those factors, tangible book value increased to $14.79, 7% higher than 12 months ago and our tangible common equity ratio improved to 7.5%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">The last point that I would note is that we did add a slide in the appendix as we updated our capital allocations across the segments coming into 2015 and the returns that we show you are reflective of those updated capital allocations.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Let\u2019s go ahead and flip to slide seven, and go through loans, from several calls, we are asked frequently about the decline in reported loans, which are down modestly again from the fourth quarter levels as you can see in the upper left hand chart.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">I want to make a few points though as we go through this, as we have discussed many times, much of the movement in loans has been driven by two pieces of non-core loans. The first relates the shift in our discretionary mortgage loans levels that are used to manage interest rate risks and predominantly recorded in the all other units. Many times based on the investment decisions that we make, these loans are replaced with debt securities on the balance sheet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">The other component, as you look at loans to consider is the runoff that we have within our LAS unit, which are mostly home equity loans. If the home equity loans go away, it enables us to reduce our operating costs as we have less work to do.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As you can see over the past five quarters, these non-core loans have declined approximately $59 billion. If you adjust for that $59 billion though and I will go that upper right hand box, you can see they are actually -- our loans have actually increased by $21 billion from the first quarter of 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Bottom chart on this slide provides the mix of this loan growth across our primary businesses and you can see within our Wealth Management area, we have experienced strong demand in both consumer real estate, as well as securities base lending and that\u2019s led to year-over-year loan growth within that segment of 10%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Within Global Banking, we saw modest growth on a year-over-year basis. But importantly, we saw a significant pickup in activity in the first quarter of \u201915 relative to the fourth quarter of 2014. Over that timeframe loans were up $6.7 billion or 8% on an annualized basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">If we move to slide eight and take a look at regulatory capital, this quarter the Standardized transition reporting includes the switch from reporting RWA under the general risks based approach to Basel 3 and the capital number includes another year of phase-in for capital deductions. With those changes, our CET1 ratio was 11.1% in 2015 under the new reporting.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">If we go ahead and look at Basel 3 regulatory capital on our fully phase-in basis, our CET1 capital improved $6 billion during the quarter and was driven by earnings, lower DTA, lower threshold deductions, as well as an improvement in AOCI.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">That translated under the Standardized approach to our CET1 ratio improving from 10% in the fourth quarter to 10.3% in the first quarter of \u201915, while under the advanced approaches, the CET1 ratio improved from 9.6% to 10.1%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As you know from our 10-K disclosure, we are working with our banking regulators to obtain approval of our models in order to exit parallel run, a regulators have requested modification to certain commercial and other credit models in order to exit parallel run, which we estimate will increase our advanced approaches RWA and negatively impact the CET1 ratio that we show here by approximately 100 basis points.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">If we look at supplementary leverage, we estimate that at the end of the first quarter of \u201915, we continue to exceed the U.S. rules applicable in 2018. Our bank holding company SLR ratio was 6.3% and our primary banking subsidiary BANA we were at 7%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We turn to slide 9, long-term debt. At the end of the first quarter was $238 billion, down $5 billion from the fourth quarter of 2014. In the lower left box, you can see that from a maturity profile perspective, we have $16 billion of parent company debt that matures during the balance of \u201815 and will be opportunistic as it relates to refinancing that indebtedness.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Our global excess liquidity sources reached a record level of $478 billion this quarter and now represents 22% of the overall balance sheet. The increase from the fourth quarter reflects the deposit inflows as well as the shift from discretionary loans in the HQLA securities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Within the liquidity, our parent company liquidity remains quite strong at $93 billion and our time to require funding is at 37 months. During the quarter, we did continue to increase our liquidity coverage ratios at both the parent as well as at the bank levels. And at the end of the first quarter, we estimate that our consolidated company was well above the 100% fully phased-in 2017 LCR requirement.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On slide 10, net interest income, on a reported FTE basis was $9.7 billion, down $200 million from the fourth quarter of \u201814 driven by two fewer interest accrual days during the quarter as well as some spread compression. If we exclude the previously mentioned market-related adjustment NII of $10.2 billion was largely in line with our expectations and lower than the fourth quarter of \u201814 given two fewer interest accrual days.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Modest improvements net interest income mostly from lower funding cost in the quarter were offset by some of the continued pressures that we saw in loans, securities, yields as well as balances in new assets coming in at lower long-term rates. This drove the adjusted net interest yield to 2.28%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">If we look at the movement down in rates during the quarter, our balance sheet did become more asset sensitive compared to year end, such that 100 basis point parallel increase in rates from the end of the quarter would be expected to contribute roughly $4.6 billion in net interest income benefits over the next 12 months, slightly more than half of that $4.6 billion is on the long end and just under half is based on the short end.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On slide 11, if we move to expenses, non-interest expense was $15.7 billion in the first quarter of \u201815 and included roughly $370 million in litigation expense. First quarter \u201815 once again did include $1 billion in annual retirement eligible incentive cost consistent with what we saw in the first quarter of 2014. Litigation expense during the quarter included FX in RMBS items and was significantly below what we saw a year ago which included the cost of the FHFA settlement.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">While we\u2019re in litigation, I do want to make sure that you notice this quarter that we did get one step closer on our Article 77 settlement as the appellate court approved the Bank of New York Mellon settlement in all respects. And I would also note that the deadline for further appeal at this point has passed.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">If we exclude litigation and retirement-eligible cost, our total expenses were $14.3 billion this quarter, down nearly $1 billion from the first quarter of \u201814, driven by three factors. Continued progress on our LAS initiatives, our New BAC cost savings as well as lower revenue-related incentives within Global Markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Relative to the fourth quarter \u201814, the expense level on an adjusted basis is up about a $0.5 billion on higher revenue related incentives, mostly through the improved sales and trading results on a linked-quarter basis. Our legacy assets and servicing cost ex litigation were $1 billion. They improved approximately $100 million from the fourth quarter of 2014 in more than $500 million if we go back to the first quarter of 2014. And we remain on track to hit our Q \u201814 target that we laid out for yield of $800 million in LAS cost ex litigation once again in the fourth quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Beyond the LAS business, our teams continue to do very good work in optimizing our delivery network as well as our infrastructure. And as you can see, headcount is down 8% over the course of the last 12 months.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">If we look at asset quality on slide 12, reported net charge-offs were $1.2 billion in the first quarter versus $900 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. I do want to note that the first quarter of \u201815 included a net impact of approximately $200 million in losses associated with the DOJ settlement that was previously reserved for and that was offset in part by recoveries from certain NPL sales. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Our Q4 \u201814 included similar items but with the net adjustment positively benefiting net charge-off to the tune of about $163 million. If we just follow these impacts, our net charge-offs during the quarter were $1 billion which is slightly lower than what we saw in the fourth quarter of 2014. Our loss rates on the same adjusted basis were at about 47 basis points in the first quarter of \u201815 consistent with what we saw in the fourth quarter of \u201814, in both our consumer delinquencies as well as our NPLs decline from fourth quarter levels.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On the commercial front, we did see a slight tick up in reservable criticized exposure in the fourth quarter of \u201814 as we bounce off comparatively low levels. The first quarter of \u201815 provision expense was $765 million. We released $429 million in reserves, most of those reserve releases were in our consumer real estate portfolio while we did see a modest increase in reserves in the commercial space that was associated with the strong loan growth that we saw during the first quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We could flip to slide 13 on Consumer Banking. Hopefully last week, we all saw and had a chance to review the filing of our recasted segment results. We mentioned to you during the last earnings call that we made changes in segment reporting where we move the home loans into our Consumer Banking segment from CRES which left our legacy assets and servicing as a standalone segment. We also moved the majority of business banking from Consumer Banking to the Global Banking segment which is how we manage the business. All these changes have been made retroactively.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Let\u2019s go ahead and walk through the business segment results, starting on slide 13 with Consumer Banking. The results showed solid bottomline performance with earnings of $1.5 billion which is up slightly from the year-ago quarter and down seasonally from the fourth quarter of \u201814 which tends to be a better consumer spending quarter. Business generated a solid 21% return on allocated capital.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Total revenue was lower compared to the first quarter of \u201814 from a decline in net interest income. Two thirds of that decline in NII was a result of pushing out in the allocation of the portion of the market related NII adjustment to deposits business. Our non-interest income was stable compared to last year, reflecting good growth in both mortgage banking as well as higher card income but was offset by the portfolio divestiture gain last year of roughly $100 million in the first quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Expenses were managed tightly. Non-interest expense declined from the fourth quarter of \u201814 as we continue to reduce our financial centers in the associated cost driven by consumer behavior patterns shifting to more digital. The number of mobile banking customers continues to increase. We ended the quarter at roughly $17 million and -- the activity from these customers accounts for roughly 13% of all deposit transactions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On page 14, we\u2019ve added some additional slides here to give you a sense to some of the trends that we\u2019re seeing in the business in key drivers and see we remain a leader in many aspects of our consumer bank doing business with nearly half of all U.S. households. We look at fees compared to the first quarter of \u201814, part income was up modestly despite some affinity portfolio divestitures over the last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Our card issuance remains very strong. Our balances did decline as our customers began to pay down holiday spend balance levels and our net charge-offs remain low at 2.8% and risk-adjusted margins remain high.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We move to mortgage banking income. It was up 60% as originations for the company ramped up during the quarter. Year-over-year first mortgage originations were up 55% to $13.7 billion while our home equity line and loan originations increased 62% to $3.2 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Revenue improvement was driven by these increased volumes as well as the mix of first-lien origination that was 76% weighted towards overall refinance activity. And looking forward, the pipeline remains strong, up 50% from the end of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Moving to service charges, service charges were down versus the fourth quarter of \u201814. This fee line continues to be muted as more of our customers take advantage of our work plans in our opening accounts with higher balances.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We also continue to reduce the number of less profitable account serviced and migrate customer activity to more self service channels. As a result, we are getting the same or slightly better account fees and debit interchange from fewer accounts which is allowing us to reduce our infrastructure.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Expense is declining. And if you look at cost of deposits, it\u2019s dropped from just less than 2% in the fourth -- excuse me -- in the first quarter of \u201814 to 1.87% in the first quarter of \u201815. And lastly, as you can see while we are bringing down our overall headcount in this business, I want to note that we\u2019ve been increasing our sales specialist in the financial centers and their sales are driving client balance is higher. For example, our deposits were up 5% from the first quarter of \u201814 and our brokerage assets were up 18%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">We move to slide 15, wealth management. It generated earnings of $651 million during the quarter. We compared this with the fourth -- with the first quarter of 2014 with a $78 million decline. It\u2019s the solid fee growth that we saw during the quarter, was offset by lower net interest income and higher expense.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Once again the allocation of the market related NII adjustment drove the decline in NII which more than offset the benefits that we saw from solid loan growth. Our asset management fees continue to grow driven by strong client flows and higher market levels. Our non-interest expense increased from the first quarter of \u201814 as a result of higher revenue related incentives as well as investments in client-facing professionals. Our pre-tax margin was down 23%, down last year, largely impacted by the decline in net interest income. Return on allocated capital remains strong at 22%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">We look at the activity in drivers within Wealth Management on slide 16. You can see our asset management fees continue to grow and are up 10% from the first quarter of 2014. But this is partially offset by some of the sluggishness that we\u2019ve seen in transactional revenue within the brokerage line.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">We do continue to be an employer of choice in this business, increasing financial advisors by more than 850 individuals over the course of the last 12 months. Our client balances climbed to over $2.5 trillion, up $12 billion from the fourth quarter of \u201814, driven by strong client balance inflows.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Long-term AUM flows of $15 billion for the quarter were positive for the 23rd consecutive quarter. And as I mentioned earlier when we discussed loans, we continue to experience strong demand in both our securities base and residential mortgage lending areas of the business reaching a new record level in loans during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">On slide 17, our Global Banking earnings during the quarter were $1.4 billion, which generated a 16% return on allocated capital. Earnings were up 6% from the first quarter of \u201814 as the decline in net interest income was more than offset by lower expense as well as improved provision expense.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">As we look at NII, the year-over-year decline was driven by three things, the allocation of the market related to NII adjustments which I have touched on in previous segments, the push-out of the firm-wide LCR requirements, a good chunk of which goes to Global Banking as well as some year-over-year compression in loan spreads.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Our provision expense was lower than the first quarter of \u201814 by $185 million as we did not build reserves to the same magnitude as we did in the first quarter of last year. Non-interest expense was down 8% from the first quarter of \u201814 driven by three factors, lower technology initiative spend, lower litigation as well as lower incentive costs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Moving to the Global Banking metrics on page 18, we chart the components of revenue, which shows stability across the quarters, with the exception of NII as I just mentioned. Our investment banking fees companywide during the quarter were $1.5 billion, down 4% from the first quarter of 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">I would highlight during the quarter, we recorded the highest level of advisory fees since the Merrill merger, up 50% from the first quarter of 2014. This helped offset the drop that we saw within our leveraged finance business, as a result of the regulatory guidance that was implemented during the first half of 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Equity underwriting was also up nicely, up 10% from the first quarter of 2014. And as you look at the balance sheet, loans on average were $290 billion, up modestly on a year-over-year basis. But if you look linked quarter as I mentioned earlier, we had a fair bit of momentum ending the first quarter with balances up $7 billion on a spot basis from the fourth quarter of \u201914.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">$7 million improvement was broad-based. We saw middle-market utilization rates at levels that we\u2019ve not seen for six years at this point, so we feel good about that and within commercial real estate, we saw a linked quarter improvement as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">On slide 19, Global Markets, we earned $945 million on revenues and $4.6 billion in the quarter, leveraging 11% return on allocated capital during the quarter. Our earnings were up nicely from the fourth quarter of \u201914 but down from the first quarter, as our revenue was down 7%, excluding net DVA and FVA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">The decline from the first quarter of \u201914 was driven by lower fixed sales -- excuse me, lower fixed sales and trading results. On the expense front, non-interest expense was modestly higher year-over-year, as we had $260 million in litigation expense in the quarter. Ex-litigation, expenses were down 7% on reduced levels of revenue related incentives. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">We look at the Global Markets metrics on slide 20. Sales of trading revenue of $3.9 billion ex-DVA and FVA, as I mentioned was up nicely from our fourth quarter of \u201914 levels but down 5% from the first quarter of \u201914. Fixed sales and trading was down 7% on a year-over-year basis while equities was effectively flat with the year ago period.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Within the macro-related product areas like FX and rates, there was a solid return in volatility in client trading activity in the quarter while the credit spreads traded products areas experienced lower activity in line with lower issuance levels during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And as you look at and we layout a mix between macro and credit in the upper box, upper right hand box and you can see that our activity tends to be more heavily weighted towards credit spread trading given the position that we occupy within the issuer market. And the last point I would make our markets, our asset levels were fairly flat while VaR was below the level that we experienced last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Slide 21, Legacy Assets &amp; Servicing, you can see we saw improvement in revenue and expense trends compared to both periods within legacy assets and servicing. The loss in this segment narrowed to less than $240 million. Revenue improved as both rep and warrant was down $156 million from the year ago period and we had a more favorable MSR hedge performance. Those two factors were partially offset by lower servicing fees as we continue to reduce the servicing portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Non-interest expense, ex-litigation was a $1 billion in the quarter, once again improving approximately $100 million from the fourth quarter and more than $500 million since the first quarter of \u201914. Importantly, our 60 plus days delinquent loans were 153,000 units that were down 36,000 units or 19% from the fourth quarter of 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">We move to slide 22, All Other. All Other reflects a loss of $841 million and that includes once again the impact of the annual retirement eligible incentive costs, as well as some of the market-related NII impact.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">If we compare this quarter to the first quarter of \u201914, revenues lowered by about $683 million and that was driven by nearly $700 million in equity investment gains in the first quarter of \u201914, compared to essentially nothing in the first quarter of \u201915. And it was partially offset, as well by the absence of payment protection loss this quarter, compared to about a $141 million in the prior year quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">From a modeling perspective, the effective tax rate during the quarter was about 29% and as we look out during the balance of 2015, we would expect the tax rate to be roughly 30%, absent any unusual items.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So, I would just wrap up the prepared part of my comments that as we end the quarter, we end the quarter with record capital. We end the quarter with record liquidity. We\u2019ll begin our $4 billion share repurchase program this quarter. The team\u2019s very focused on addressing our CCAR submission.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Expense management remains a key focus across the company. Our businesses are showing good activity, including a pick up in lending across several businesses and the company credit quality remains strong and we remain well positioned to benefit in a rising interest rate environment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And with that, we\u2019ll go ahead and open it up for questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p9\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">[Operator Instructions] And we can take our first question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Hey. Thanks very much. So, Brian, very impressive commentary in the beginning of the call on headcount getting back to \u201908 levels before CFC and the Merrill Lynch acquisitions. The one question we get continually from investors is what\u2019s left to do on the expenses and you\u2019ve already got the core expense number coming into the $13 billion range. So can you give us some sense as to where you go from here on expense management and is it steady as she goes or is there room to become even more efficient?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Couple of things. One is that if you parse expenses, Betsy, into three basic buckets, the litigation expense bucket, which you are seeing come down to more reasonable levels and then there is a cost of that litigation and the external legal fees and stuff, which will continue to see lift in which is in the expense numbers. Then you have the second bucket LAS worth a billion level and as Bruce said, we would expect to get down to $800 million and keep moving at to lower numbers over into \u201916.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And then given the baseline and I think the thought on the baseline is even as we reduce the headcount, we continued to reinvest in sales capacity. So just in our consumer business, headcount is down year-over-year but we have a thousand more sales people roughly out there selling. And so the idea is to continue to drive sales people into the businesses. At the same time, we\u2019ve taken our wealth management, et cetera. So when you think about the broad expense base, there is adjustments always in the first quarter, second quarter just because of revenue and stuff in terms of the aggregate amount.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">But we will continue to pare way. You can look linked quarter -- year-over-year quarters over the last four years, we continued to chip away. This year it was 300 on the core base. We will continue to work at that. But I would say that a lot of it, we are trying to make sure that we create the investment rate and continue to grow the franchises and their size. This is a matter of holding these expenses relatively flat as revenues start to pick up with the expected increase in rates in economy continue to grow. As that change, we have to go aggressively and push down the core also. And so we manage it everyday and you can see the headcounts leading indicator because that headcount reduction in the quarter really benefits us in the second quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Got it. And then just separate topic on GWIM, and maybe you could give us some commentary around how you are thinking about the impact of the fiduciary language that\u2019s been coming out of the Department of Labor? And also how you deal with the competitive threats coming from Silicon Valley, including some of the robo-advisor efforts?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">On the first question, John Thiel who runs Merrill Lynch for us, where largely we are affected by the discussion on fiduciary standards. Remember, U.S. Trust is actually a private bank and operates into the fiduciary standard and most of its activity. So, John Thiel does the lead in our business does great job for us and has been clear. We believe that doing what\u2019s in the best interest of the customer is absolutely the right thing to do. And while this rule has just come out yesterday afternoon and frankly, Betsy, to get prepared for your questions this morning, I have spent a lot of time examining into detail. But from a basic standpoint, we\u2019ve been clear that that\u2019s we see the industry moving and we expect lot of movement there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">On the robo-advisor, I think that the clear segment match for us in that area in terms of what Schwab and other people have talked about is really in the Merrill Lynch business, which is below the Merrill Lynch cut-off a lot of their return. So, John and his team drive people to $150,000 in investable assets free to invest, which is net worth of a $0.5 million in the upper range of the client and Dean Athanasia and his preferred team drive the business below that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And if you look in our information, you will see that that business has got about $118 billion of both, which assets are growing faster than the industry. Year-over-year, I think the assets were up 18%. The number of accounts of the sales levels were up and so that\u2019s really the automated rebalancing portfolios and stuff like that and we are driving that through as a core execution. And by the way, they also refer tens of thousands of customers a year up to Merrill Lynch at the same time. So we are trying to have the best of both worlds.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. Thanks. You\u2019ve been a leader there, so appreciate that color. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And we can take our next question from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Good morning, Matt.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Any sense of when we get a clear picture on the final impact of exiting parallel run? Should we just assume the 100 basis point hit that you mentioned a done deal or is there a potential to be less than that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes. I think what we wanted to disclose, Matt is that I think they were coming out of the disclosure that we had in the K. There were a lot of questions and you are absolutely right that what we disclosed today was the requested amount from our banking regulators to exit parallel run that was the outcome. We have discussions continue but we did want to put out there what the ask was.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. In terms of timing of -- a conclusion on that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I think those things are always hard to predict, but we are obviously working hard to get through it over the next quarter or so.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. And just related, I mean, obviously capital build was very good this quarter of 50 basis points. So you essentially got half of that already, but assuming that 100 basis point hit goes through, are there additional kind of RWA levers to pull model adjustments in the future that we can think about?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yeah. You asked a very good question, which is that -- to the extend that there is an adjustment in the RWA, you obviously as you look to refine and improve your models, always have the ability to work hard to get that back if there is obviously a lot of scrutiny with respect to models. But your point is spot on is that there would be the opportunity as we work through and look to refine improve and become better with our models to get some of that back over time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And Matt, in the broader context, we have flipped the binding constraint in our company to some degree with the move to advance and so therefore, you continue to look at the balance sheet, what makes the businesses and how you approach the businesses changes again to standardize with the constraint we are focused on. And with our binding constraint now it\u2019s going to flip to advance as you can see in the numbers and that bend is -- you expect us to be as aggressive and in depth at thinking through how we mix the businesses right to make sure that we are focused on that constraint now has become a binding rule.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And we can take our next question from Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Paul Miller</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes. Thank you very much. On your legacy asset servicing -- in your discussions, you said that the loans went down from 36,000 loans in the quarter. Did you sell any loans in the quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">There was some servicing of loans that was moved, as well as the outright sale of some non-performing loans. So there was some inorganic activity but as you look at those reductions, it was very strong from both organic as well as inorganic. And I would say the other thing that we are seeing Paul is just less new delinquencies coming in than we what we would have expected. So you\u2019ve got the benefit of less coming in. You\u2019ve got the benefit of working through some of what you have and then we are supplementing that with moving additional out.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Paul Miller</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yeah. And one of the things out there is what we are seeing or hearing is that there is a strong market right now for people wanting to buy either re-performing or non-performing loans. Are you going to use that as an advantage to start moving the stuff off your books quicker?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">We have been using as an advantage. If you go back and look at the results, I think we were one of the first out there that started to move those loans in the first half of 2014. We\u2019ve been aggressively doing that both to take the risk of the loans off as well as to move the servicing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And I think as if you look at the impact of that and how it flows through different things, you really get a good sense, Paul, when you look at some of the CCAR results where the loss content that we have particularly within both first mortgages as well as home equity has come down. So we have been at that for some time at this point.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Paul, I think overall remember as you get further and further remove from the crisis, what\u2019s leftover or even though at the time when we said fairly answer that some of these non-core portfolios would have been a product to service, you did want to continue seven years later, you are seeing the customers are left over to paid. And so there is a good bid, but also we want to make sure we measure the economics of the portfolios. Now they are much smaller. The risk is way down.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And so we judge that really on the basis of, who the customer is and whether we want to sort of roam into core loans in our company and then also what the economics the outside are. So I wouldn\u2019t expect us to change our course there, whether its look opportunistically, we had to keep move in the right direction on both servicing and that\u2019s that we own too because remember Paul there is also servicing side to this, even though we don\u2019t own the asset. There is a strong bid. Even the agencies are moving to move some portfolios.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Paul Miller</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. Thank you, guys.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And we can take our next question from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Hey, good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Just want to follow up on the capital discussion. You guys had pretty good progress on the advanced approach of 50 basis points quarter-over-quarter, but the gap between standardized and advanced is still very large. And I guess if you have to go through with the 400 basis points that I guess about 120 basis point gap versus your peers that are less than half that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I guess is the big difference operational risk because of the larger litigation you faced over the last couple of years? And how do we think about that coming down and getting more in line with the peers? Is that just a time sort of as you get further away that, like those op risk come down or how else do we think about the trajectory of the closing of the gap?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">No. Your point is exactly right which is that as we talked about last quarter that the op risk relative to the total advanced startup was upwards of 30%. That\u2019s obviously higher than our peers. It\u2019s something that we are working hard on to be able to drive down. And to your point, the question is when you\u2019re able to get benefit from declining litigation trend as we wrap up the legacy matters and that does take some time. Obviously, the last two quarters from litigation perspective have been much lighter than what we experienced going back several years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So it\u2019s up to us to continue to work that and to look to convince people that the level of op risk capital should come down given the resolution of the matters. And I would just highlight that once again whether you look at Article 77, there was an Ocala litigation matter that was wrapped up as well as on the RMBS front with settlements that we got through this quarter were roughly 99% of all threatened or filed litigation with respect to RMBS. So we continue to work through that and drive through that. And ultimately the benefit from that should be lower op risk capital from an RWA perspective.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Right. And sorry, is that sort of a negotiation process on the models with regulators or is it could it be sort of a step function or is it really just time value as you move further away? I am just trying to understand the process.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I think in all these cases, clearly that we work closely with our supervisors on all model related activity. And as you look to make changes that are to the good, you obviously need to work through your regulators to get those put through.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So I think as we think forward remember, you saw a good capital built this quarter and we will continue to build. But remember that we keep on the course of earnings that we expect and the issue was in CCAR last year when we asked, you had to remember we came off a really low just nominal earnings environment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And so we came with a lot of capital between now and next time. We\u2019ve been asked to change the capital position of the company and we have a big cushion. So we will close this gap relatively quickly. And then we have a longer-term question of what you are saying which is as op risk runs off how do you get that reflected all coming your capital requirements and same with the models and the other side.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Right at to your point, the stress test is based on standardized not advanced?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">But just one quick follow-up elsewhere on the FICC revenues, just can you talk about the trajectory over the quarter, did it improve in March? It sounded like some of your peers talked about a slow start to get any better in March or how do we think about the trajectory to the quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I am always hesitant to comment on results given that we are nine days into a new quarter. But I think if you look at what we saw from both, I would say both a sales and trading as well as an overall investment banking fee perspective, the January and the margin was a little bit slower than what was expected.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And we saw activity and momentum build up throughout the quarter to where if you had to grade which is three months to the quarter. If you feel best about, it was clearly March. And like I said, we are only nine trading days into the new quarter. But we\u2019ve not seen anything change directionally some of the activity that we saw in March, we\u2019ve continued to see in April.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. Great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And we can take our next question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Thanks very much. A quick question on proposal eight in the proxy, I mean I don\u2019t think the regulators wanted to happen, I don\u2019t think it should happen, I assume you have been doing a lot of the work on this along the way for last couple of years. But curious why the Board is so against shareholders voting it for and what you actually have to do if it does get the yes vote?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Well, I think as I think you read the response in the proxy, Glenn, you will see this is a core Board duty and they do look at it periodically and think about the optimal company structure, capital structure. So the idea to have a special element around it is really the whole Board looks at it and that\u2019s you should look at it so.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And then the technical terms of the what the request is or little hard to understand when you think about how company really operates, but we do look at the question of, do we have the optimal business mix, is it optimal from shareholders and the Board will look at it continuously and we will continue to look at.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. I appreciate the comments you made on the increased asset sensitivity. And if I remember the numbers correctly, it sounds like more of the increased sensitivity came out on the long end. So I guess my question is, it\u2019s great you make a lot more money at the current shifts of 100 basis points, but I think a lot of people are more fearful of what happens if we get into a flattener environment. So is it as simply as you capture at least half the benefit short rates going up and if you are in the flattener that\u2019s where then?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I think couple of things Glenn. First is that we are coming -- in many respects we were 35, 36 at the end of the year, we went to 45, 46 this quarter. Keep in mind a chunk of what you see as far as becoming more asset sensitive is just the FAS 91 that we lost during the quarter. So keep that in mind.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And to your point, you are exactly right if you looked out where we were at year end, I think we were just over in the 21 to 22 benefit from short rates moving and that has not changed materially. So to your point the asset sensitivity is based almost solely on long-term rates and given the deltas that we saw change from the end of the year to the end of the first quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">We will take our next question from Jon McDonald with Sanford C. Bernstein. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jon McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Hi, Bruce. Just to follow up on that in terms of if rates kind of stay pretty flat, what kind of outlook would you have for the core NII if we take the 10.2 this quarter as a jumping off point? Do you have any room to lower the debt cost from here or how would you expect the core NII to trend if we don\u2019t see too much move in rates?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">We spent a lot of time on, Jon. We got at the end of the first quarter, we looked at and said during the balance of 2015, what\u2019s the impact that we would see if in effect we rolled the spot throughout 2015, which just means that you don\u2019t get the benefit of the curve as we go through. And if you look at that, it\u2019s roughly a couple hundred million dollars a quarter relative to $10 billion of NII.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So we think that we\u2019ve done between the debt footprint deposits. And if you actually look at the clean yields during the quarter Q4 to Q1 that we have done a pretty good job of managing this exposure in what\u2019s been a tough environment. But to your question there is probably a couple hundred million dollars a quarter and risk if you roll the spot.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jon McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Got it. Okay. And that couple hundred million over a couple of quarters, right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">It is up 200 per quarter over the next three quarters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jon McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Got it. And that\u2019s just kind of core leakage from new stuff coming on lower yields and you are not investing much in a low rate environment?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">That\u2019s correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And continue to shorten the balance sheet every time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jon McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. And then just switching gears for this on the credit side, do you see the net charges-off kind of bouncing around a $1 billion per quarter level or is there room for those to come down or is that kind of stabilizing and how should we think about reserve releases from here relative to the 400 or so you did this quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yes. Couple of things. And we continue to see Jon if you look at the -- within the consumer space and overall consumer credit, the first quarter typically all other things being equal is the toughest consumer quarter in the first quarter. So I think there is probably a little bit of room there if we continue to see what we see in the economy on the consumer side.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">The tougher piece of it\u2019s probably to judge commercial because outside of what we see in the small business lending, there really haven\u2019t been many charge-offs and we will just have to see how long that benign environment covers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">On the reserve release for the quarter, what they want to make sure that we point out that while we release 400 plus of reserves, 200 of that was from the DOJ where with the mailings you had both charge-offs and reserve release. So as it relates to just from a -- as you look at the provision perspective realize that which impacted the provisions more like 200.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jon McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. So that should be some at least the jumping off points more like a 200 reserve release number?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yes. And I think we said that we clearly expect reserve releases to moderate. So, a lot to see as we roll into the quarters. But I think you are directionally right on your charge-off number and we will see if there is anything left in the reserve releases as we go through the second and third quarters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jon McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. Last quick thing for me. In terms of rep and warrants, the slide 26 not sure if you mentioned this already because there is a pickup in the claims, the new claims this quarter showed a big increase. Just what\u2019s the driver of that while they will show up now and any color you can provide on whether that\u2019s a concern or not?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yes. I think you need to go down to and we laid out in the footnote, but if you start up in the new claim trends, if you recall there is the case going through where the statute of limitations on rep and warrant claims in the Ace case was found, the statute was six years. And if you look at the claims that you see up in the new claim trends, you can see virtually all of those claims were in the pre 2005 through 2006 area.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So absent any tolling a good chunk of those are going to be time barred. The other part that I would -- the other point that I would mention is if you go down to the footnote, you can see that the vast majority of these claims were put in with no file worked on whatsoever or no individual loan work that was done. So I think there continues to be obviously activity on that front, but there is not a lot of work being done as those claims are being filed.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jon McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">We will take our next question from Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Hi, good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So Bruce I just wanted to touch on the preferreds for a moment. So we saw that you completed another $3 billion of issuance in the quarter, but seem as you are already at the 150 basis point target contemplated under Basel III, whether it\u2019s fair to assume that you are now full on perhaps at the moment and we shouldn\u2019t expect any additional issuance?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I think you are absolutely right that we\u2019ve got the bucket filled up this quarter. I think the only thing that\u2019s out there is depending on exactly where we come out from an overall RWA perspective as we exit parallel run that beyond 2015 could there be a $2 billion more preferred sometime during \u201816, that\u2019s a possibility. But you\u2019re absolutely right that based on where we are from an RWA perspective, the buckets filled up. So we don\u2019t see much of any at all in \u201815 maybe a little bit in \u201816 but not much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Excellent. Thanks for clarifying that, Bruce. And I suppose that you mentioned RWA, one thing I just wanted to clarify, I believe it was relating to your response to Jim where you noted that for CCAR it only contemplate the standardized approach. But I just wanted to know if that determination have been finalized since some are speculating that the advanced approach could be incorporated within the CCAR exam going forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yeah. No, there is an open question out there that you\u2019re absolutely right that for the different CCAR submissions that went in 2015 that those submissions are against the standard ratios. As an industry, we just don\u2019t know the answer. If we\u2019ll test under just standardized in CCAR 2016 or if advanced will be brought in, that\u2019s an open question that\u2019s out there for the industry.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And do you have a sense at least for the moment as to what the impact will be on RWAs if they were to incorporate the advanced approach versus the standardized?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I think if you look at the numbers you can see the difference that we have within our numbers as to advanced. I think the open question that\u2019s out there as you look at moving to advanced in a CCAR scenario is that under advanced you hold the capital for up risk. And then there is the open question if you go to stress test under advanced, what do you do with respect to CCAR in those up risk litigation type item. And like I said, that\u2019s an open question for the industry.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Right. But would it be fair to expect that because it is the advanced calculation is more procyclical in nature that the RWA is calculated under a period of stress would be higher versus the standardized?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">There is no question. There is a procyclical class that does it. That intuitively, I think you\u2019re right but it just until you understand exactly the completeness and the entire picture of what you\u2019re looking at I just don\u2019t want to speculate.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">No. Fair enough. All right. That\u2019s it for me. And thank you for taking my questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">We\u2019ll take our next question from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ken Usdin</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the investments in brokerage services business. The metrics continue to look very strong as far as assets gain but the growth rate on year-over-year basis looks like it slowed considerably. Any context you can provide around revenue generation and is there a potential catch-up that we should see or expect going forward based on either markets or just activity levels?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Let me -- from a high level, that team has continued to invest in growth. So there\u2019s a couple of things driving that. One is they\u2019re adding more core advisor, so in the last 12 months I think we added 120 experienced advisors and we added almost 900 total. So in that there is a carry cost to bring those up but we\u2019ve -- that's good for the future.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">The second thing is there\u2019s a little bit of the business mix issue which is that the investment management side of business continues to grow but we\u2019ve seen weakness in the brokers transactional side as the business get reposition and that sort of year-over-year is enough to hit you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And then third frankly is that the NII that Bruce point out earlier, just the way we allocate and we won\u2019t let businesses take an excuse for intercompany allocations. But the way we allocate year-over-year, a big chunk of the NII losses just to the way we allocate out the impact from the market and less NII.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ken Usdin</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. And then secondly, just extending that to the other -- some of the other consumer fee lines, your card income flattish in service charges down a bit, is this customer behavior driven or an additional repositioning in there? And can you talk about growth expectations on the consumer side as well?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yes. I think as Bruce talked about earlier, if you think about the couple of broad things. One is as we continue to drive to be the core checking account for households, we\u2019re seeing higher sales, we\u2019re seeing higher primary sales but with that comes less fees in a sense but the average balances are higher.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And so what you\u2019re seeing is a lower -- the flattening of the fees, charge on accounts overdraft and other fees, while you see an increase in the consumer balances which in this environment were something that we worth a lot more as rates rise because these are core checking account. So yeah, there is some elements that how the business has been shipped and based on our priority of getting -- making sure that we just don\u2019t have a lot of checking accounts, we have a lot of core checking account and that has caused it. So you\u2019re seeing a far faster growth in balances and actually slight decline in total check accounts out there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">When you put debit fees and other fees plus the interest rates together which is a core checking revenue, it\u2019s actually a better picture. But that\u2019s kind of the story there. On the credit card fees, it\u2019s -- basically we have absorbed most of the compression on the interchange at this point in the rebase we give. So really year-over-year you had a bit of loss there because we added a divestiture of a big Affinity program, two big Affinity program that hurt us. And you should expect to see that a little bit more inline with our spending growth going forward which has done about 3%, 4%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ken Usdin</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay. And then last one, just Bruce, you mentioned on the discretionary portfolio and the switch out to HQLA. Can you give us a sense of just how much more of that mix shift we should expect or at some point, you get to appoint where the loan portfolio finally starts to bottom out?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I think a couple of things, so that the shift to the discretionary portfolio, you probably have about $5 billion of that in each of the second quarter and the third quarter of this year and at that point that work is done. I would say as you look at just discretionary mortgage balances and what you\u2019re seeing from a payments for the old stuff that was put within the investment portfolio, you\u2019re probably looking at before the new is that we put on within the business that you are in $10 billion to $14 billion type run-off in each of the next couple quarters, realized all that net interest income doesn\u2019t go away because there is reinvestment of that and there is new loans coming in. But you do have probably two more quarters where we\u2019ll move stuff into securities and obviously that does continue to be a runoff of that portfolio as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ken Usdin</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">We\u2019ll take our next question from Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Thanks very much. Just one quick question on the legal expense that was incurred in this period, are those issues now the FX and the RMBS, are those issues now settled or are they ongoing?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">The RMBS piece I quoted, there were both amounts and litigation for things that were settled, as well as accruals during the quarter. And once again Eric, I will go back to that the -- from an RMBS perspective at this point, we are 98% or 99% of threatened or filed claims on original UPB that we are through. So that\u2019s where we are with the RMBS. With respect to the FX piece, I think if you go back and look at to where we said that we were in October, that we resolved the matter with the OCC.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">The top-up that we saw in the quarter related to FX with respect to other banking regulators and the results. So the resolution and we\u2019re working through the final documentation of the civil piece of the overall FX work and that\u2019s all included within the litigation reserve during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay. And so just to understand that last point, the civil component, is that with the DoJ or some other kind of authority?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">No. It\u2019s the civil piece with respect to a class action type matter, not the DoJ.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I see. Okay. But that was contained within the accrual in this period.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">That\u2019s correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay. Great. Thank you for the clarity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">We\u2019ll go next to Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Hi. What are your financial targets for 2015 and 2016?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">So, Mike, as we said, our goal is to continue to drive toward the 1% return on assets and depending on where we end up with capital between 7.5% and 8% tangible common equity ratio that we translate into 13 to down to 12 return on tangible common equity. In this quarter, we move to up to where we have our return on tangible common equity was 8%. And so return on assets was 64 basis points, so we serve two-thirds of the way to that goal.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And what timeframe do you expect to get there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Well, I think if you adjust our earnings this quarter for a couple of things, the FAS 123, the FAS 91 and then we continue to think of LAS normalizing. You see us get close to that goal and that should happen between now and the end of \u201816 because we just keep chunking away at LAS as we described here.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">So is that your specific financial targets to -- and what\u2019s your target for 2015 when it comes to your financial metrics?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yeah. Mike, I think the way you ask that, we especially have to give you our earnings estimates for \u201915 and we just don\u2019t do that. But our targets long-term, we\u2019ve told you each time you asked us is a 1% return on assets and a 12%, 13% return on tangible common equity based on what we think our tangible common equity ratio will settle out.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay. I guess when I looked back at 2014 I ask myself the question, did Bank America meet its financial targets? And I\u2019ve trouble because I\u2019m not sure that you have specific targets just for the year 2014 as opposed to your longer term targets?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">We made $4 billion in change last year against the expectation by unit you and your colleagues of -- I don\u2019t know $15 billion that clearly did meet the financial targets to litigation we took last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay. Let me just ask a separate question then. Glenn Schorr brought a proposal in the proxy. And I guess my reaction is why not give more information on the tradeoffs of the business model. One of your competitors gave three slides on this topic at their investor day. They weren\u2019t asked to do this and they have some higher ROE and ROA. So more information I think would be good. And in the proxy, it says that your Board believes that the proposal would not enhance stockholder value. If that\u2019s the conclusion of the Board, just why not share some of the insights of the Board to investors?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">So the insights we have and you look at the returns on page two and three of the material show that the core businesses return above our cost of capital. And that the mix between them and the revenue synergies and the diversity we get have been there but let\u2019s backup. A lot of people are looking at here, Mike, is can you simplify your company to make it tighter. We started that in 2010 was about $2.5 billion and we are trading that as we are down to 2.1.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">We started with about $7 billion in capital or $8 billion in capital, up to $140 billion and we started by getting rid of the 60 operating businesses and so we\u2019ve done a lot of implications. What\u2019s really left and this is one of the reason why our market business is more constrained its growth prospects potentially than some other peoples because we keep it to about a third of the franchise in terms of size.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And that market business is really focused on driving the value of our issuer side customers going to the market and then with our investor side customers providing sources of capital for that, so it\u2019s a very synergistic basis. So, we\u2019ll continue to provide insight but if you look at it, the businesses return of other cost of capital and then if we put them out there, the question would be, what we be look like after and we have capital we can\u2019t deploy and we have less earnings powers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">All right. But you can share additional insights into that conclusion in addition to what you just gave, that would be great at least in the future. Thanks a lot.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And we can take our next question from Nancy Bush with NAB Research. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Nancy Bush</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Good morning, guys.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Nancy Bush</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I have sort of one straightforward question and one that\u2019s more existential. I\u2019ll ask the straight forward one first. Brian, could you just restate your position on paying or raising the dividend? I know the CCAR this year has distorted that a bit and if you could just state how you feel about dividends versus buyback?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Well, I think number one, in terms of -- we received approval for what we asked, which is a nickel a share dividend and $4 billion of stock buyback in the CCAR. And we had to be conservative in that ask, leaving aside the modeling and other questions, but just had to be conservative based ask, because if you think about it, our run rate of earnings was such that we\u2019re coming off of $4 billion plus earnings score. We had to keep our head on in terms of how we\u2019re accumulating capital and make sure we earned the capital before we paid them.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">The second thing is that the [$0.2 billion] [ph] of cushion shows that based on all the works at CCAR, we have a strong cushion going forward. So the key for us to be able to increase the dividend and continue to push forward is to get that normalized earnings stream in a couple of quarters, $3 million plus of earnings we\u2019re getting.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Long-term, we\u2019ve said many times our ultimate goal is to take about 3% of our recurring earnings and pay it out in dividends and then to use the rest for capital management. At this price we would be buying stock back and if there is a different scenario where our multiple to book and earnings multiples are higher, we might pay additional dividends, but the goal would be about 30% payout ratio of recurring earnings as we get there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Nancy Bush</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay. Thank you. The second one is this. And this is maybe a little bit more difficult to answer. You had a good trading quarter, but we\u2019ve seen one of your competitors have a much better trading quarter. And I know that there is a mix issue there. But also as I kind of look at the composition of your businesses there, have you sort of de-risked the trading desk to the point where you can\u2019t really take full advantage of the volatility in markets? And I\u2019m wondering if you see that as the case. And secondly, if there will come a time when you\u2019re able to do some re-risking there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I think, the Nancy what you asked is really the core question, which is, if you look a few years ago when we put core capital Global Markets out as a separate reported segment to ensure that people saw that that was a less volatile earnings stream than people perceived and it was not the earnings stream of the Global Banking segment, high investment banking which you could see the fees up or down and were relatively stable in clearly the loan book and treasury services. So we tried to sort the businesses so people can see what we\u2019re doing in the global markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Based on our capital and based on our view of how the franchise fit together, we keep that business about a third of our total size. This total balance sheet deployed is under $600 billion and had them for years. That then requires Tom and the team to make a series of choices how they deploy that based on our appetite for risk expressed by VaR, our appetite for size expressed by the $600 billion which other people have far bigger balance sheet to deploy the business. And that does limit their ability to take risk and do certain things.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">So there is a mix issue based on this quarter. In other quarters we performed better relatively and that\u2019s this issue, but from a core standpoint, it\u2019s not an existential question at all. It is an actual determination we made to have our 50 buffer lower, to have our overall risk lower and demand to company which is really customer focused on the core banking middle markets franchise and the core investors. It\u2019s still be big enough to be very impactful number one research house in the world and have $3.5 billion to $4 billion of revenue in the giving quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">We had to basically optimize around size capital, capital deployment business and then the risk we\u2019re willing to put in the P&amp;L and that\u2019s where we ended up. And that\u2019s resulted I think 100 basis points less SIFI buffer requirement than other people. And we think that\u2019s balanced because with our book of business if we increased that we\u2019ve got to carry that 100 basis points across the whole franchise, not just the market business, and that extra capital in our balance would really increase the capital requirements that really not needed for our core banking business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Nancy Bush</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">So basically you are happy with the trading desk as it is?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Yes, I mean -- no, we\u2019re always never happy because we always wanted to do better. I mean, that\u2019s not -- but on the other hand, it\u2019s fair to say that we are not unsatisfied when we make almost $1 billion after tax in the quarter where they were -- where they had a couple of big elements, this mix in the macro businesses which we are positioned in on purpose.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">And then secondly remember the core part of our business we are still adjusting to which was the leverage finance transaction business, which you can look at is down dramatically year-over-year as we adopted the guidance and they were -- what was acquired. That\u2019s through the numbers now, and then we will build back based on that business doing it the way that meets the regulatory standard. So happy, we are never happy with any business. We are always pushing them to do better, but given the constraints there is an understanding I would say more than happiness of where we ended up.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Nancy Bush</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Okay. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">We\u2019ll take our next question from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Hi. Good morning, guys. A quick follow-up on the op risk questions. So if we still have pending settlements out there on a few of the remaining sort of large issues, could that lead to op risk at least sustaining at elevated levels or/and could it even potentially cause a little bit of an uplift there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Yes. I think at this point we walk through. And we said in the last call that we are at the level that we need to be from a overall op risk perspective. And to your point, if you look at the last two quarters relative to when that op risk capital was set, we\u2019ve seen fairly sizeable declines in overall litigation expense. So you obviously work through that, but our belief overtime is that number should be less, not more but we need to deliver that to the shareholder.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Yes. I mean, from your lips to God\u2019s ears, but if we still have some potential settlements my only point is that it might take a little while before we end up seeing that come down. Isn\u2019t that a similar reason?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Just as we said there is a bid ask on the RWA related to commercial credit factors and models. There was a bid ask and operating risk. We closed that out. And we\u2019ve actually moved our RWA to a number of those asks. And then from then, we just look at it very simply, think about the last four quarters versus last year and just taking up third and fourth quarter, you have a complete change in the amount of litigation expense that\u2019s gone through the enterprise and you see that keep going through. It will take a while for that to average out, but basically assume that we\u2019ve agreed to with amount which was requested to bring our op risk and we put that through last quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Okay. Thanks. And then it seems some high level turnover in your equities business. Can you comment maybe on what\u2019s driving some of those departures, any potential implications and what you are doing about it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Yes. I mean, we\u2019ve had some retirements of people worked in the business for 25 years, Henry and team, and it\u2019s just the ebb and flow of business, I don\u2019t think there is any major issues going on there. I think that [Thong Nguyen] [ph] and team have done a good job and stabilized that business and brought it back. We continue to work on the prime brokerage side to make sure that we can be positioned to sort of restart that engine of growth.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Now that -- now we had both the business back, we got the operating platform in place where we wanted to be [indiscernible] not this past fall but fall before. So I think you shouldn\u2019t be thinking into that other than usual ebb and flow of people deciding to do other things.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Okay. Thanks for that color. And then the last one for me, following up on Ken's question, it sounds like the FA headcount add are sort of biased a little more to the junior side? So should we count on a bit of a headwind from that on your productivity metrics in GWIM and maybe could you also comment on the recruiting environment currently and if you still think that comp may moderate as some of those deals with FAs from crisis level sunset\u2026</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">The average deal last year I think was 100, for highest end producing FAs which there were 100 up -- 120 up. The average deal was like 127 -- 1.27 times going to others that might that are fly to us and that\u2019s, don\u2019t know the exact number to think conceptually. So the rumors about these payoffs are probably far in excess. The reality is only 120 people or so. So take whatever number.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">So let\u2019s broaden out the productivity question, the productivity per advisor in our business is extremely strong and has sort of structurally been strong for many years and continues to increase.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">You wouldn\u2019t mine eluding that to get faster long-term growth prospects of the business and broaden out the business and that\u2019s what John and team are doing, whether it goes down and not really going to be a factor. How fast the revenue stream grows. It\u2019s been our growing net impact of investing in the loan business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">But we aren\u2019t, yes, so I wouldn\u2019t -- I would say it\u2019s going to go down or up based on the added younger advisors, but let\u2019s flip that and say, there is the way we think this business has to drive for our competitive advantage as franchise, there is a linkage from preferred to Merrill Lynch Wealth Management and the interactions between the financial services centers and the people come in there and tens of thousands people that get referred to Merrill is a competitive advantage for Merrill.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">And we will continue to drive that, part of that connectivity is we are now putting Merrill team-based brokers in the branches to work with clients and ultimately move physically onto the team in the offices. So we\u2019ve got a lot of program going. They seem to be working very well. It could dilute the productivity a little bit, but it would immaterial because of the strength of the core franchise is so strong.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Thanks for the color.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">And we can take our final question from Jeff Harte with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Good morning, Jeff.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jeff Harte</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Good morning, guys. A couple from me, first of all, you mentioned the commercial utilization rate being up a lot. Can you give me some or give us some idea of how much of that is energy complex driven versus maybe coming from other less stressed industries?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Yeah. Most of all that, given that the number I quoted was within the Commercial Bank, that\u2019s almost exclusively outside of the energy space. So it has nothing to do with anything to stress. It just core commercial plans driving more those numbers bottom down in the low 30s and they are now up in the high 30s. Yeah, think of that, when we say Commercial that\u2019s middle market, general middle market for us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Not the Corporate Bank where the energy exposures would be so. It\u2019s back to basically where it was, not the highest point, because it\u2019s ran up right before the crisis. But if you look back it\u2019s higher than it wasn\u2019t say 4 and 5 at this point right on. So you just start to see the normalization of that borrowing, which is good news, because that means the people borrowing the money to do something.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jeff Harte</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Okay. And looking at the balance sheet, I mean, can you talk a little bit about the plans, the kind of the level of excess cash, I mean, 22% of assets in cash, a 7% plus SLR ratio? It would seem awfully tough to generate ROE or ROA with that much of the balance sheet sitting in cash, is there something you can do there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Yeah. Look, I think, the first thing, if you look that, you have to consider as that. As we went through with the different regulatory metrics we needed to get to that that the last metric that we needed to solve for and we wanted to get behind us was the satisfaction of where we needed to be from the LCR perspective in 2017 at both the bank level, as well as the parent and work to the point where we\u2019ve gotten to that point. So from an overall liquidity HQLA perspective we feel very good about that progress.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">As you look at on a go-forward bases, obviously, the big focus and the reason as a company that we are looking to drive the loan growth that we have is to basically take the access deposits today that are within the investment portfolio and release them from the investment portfolio into two core loan activity to do more with our clients.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">So as you look at the changes and mix in the balance sheet as far as the built that you\u2019ve seen with cash. I think we are at the point where from an overall balance and where we need to be with the different metrics that we\u2019ve satisfied that at this point and it will be more of a normal course on a go-forward basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Yeah. I think generally thematically if you think about as we see rules come up, we try to get in full compliances as fast as possible even though there is delay dates. And then you can then work back on how to continuously improve the way you get there but first thing you guys do is get over the humps because it affects every other aspect of the franchise. And so I think the LCR and case set we got over the hump 17 is two years away still and we are in compliance and then the idea is that you keep to figure out how that work to dies to make it more and more shareholder friendly overtime, but the first we want to make sure we can do.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jeff Harte</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Okay. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Lee McEntire</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">I think that\u2019s a -- I think that was the last question. Thanks for joining today and we\u2019ll talk to you in the next quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">This concludes the program for today.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later you will have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this call may be recorded. I'll be standing by should you need any assistance. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. Lee McEntire. You may begin sir.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Lee McEntire</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning. Thanks to everybody on the phone, as well as the webcast for joining us this morning for the second quarter results. Hopefully, everybody has had a chance to review the earnings release documents that are available on the website.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">So before I turn the call over to Brian and Bruce, let me just remind you we may make some forward-looking statements and for further information on those please refer to either our earnings release documents, our website or our SEC filings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">So with that I'm pleased to turn it over to Brian Moynihan, our CEO for some opening comments, before Bruce Thompson, the CFO goes through the details. Brian?</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you, Lee, and good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us for our second quarter results. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">As you can see from our release we reported $5.3 billion in after tax earnings this quarter, which is up from last quarter as well as more than double what we made last year. Not only were we pleased with the bottom line, but revenue was up and expenses were down comparably against both periods. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Lots of things came together to achieve these results and we continue to work on all these also. On the expense side we told you that we achieved this new BAC cost savings back in the third quarter of last year. However, we didn't give up on our focus on expenses and you can see those in the results. It's the lowest non-litigation expense base since 2008. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">At the same time we continue to invest in the future of this company. Just to mention a few of these investments, we added sales specialists in our financial centers, up 3% versus last year. We added 3% to our financial advisers since last year, 4% to our commercial and business bankers. We've opened new financial centers in new markets that we previously didn't have coverage and we continue to upgrade those in other markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">In addition, we continue to invest in young new talent in our company. We hired a record number of teammates from college, over 1,200 and we have our intern program to over 1,800 this summer. And we continue to invest as we have said in technology, so that was $3 billion we spent this year to continue to improve and drive our products and our capabilities in the company.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">As we are doing that we continue to focus on our process improvement, our simplified and improved effort continues to take hold and you saw that to have some affect that this quarter. The goal of that program is to hold the costs, manage them well as the economy continues to recover and our revenues continue to recover.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Away from expenses, a few other highlights for the quarter. We saw overall loan growth and balances from the first quarter. We saw continued improvement in our net charge-offs and credit quality; our deposits in our consumer continue to grow even faster this quarter than prior quarters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We also built capital and tangible book value despite the OCI impact of higher rates. We\u2019ve returned over $1.3 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and common dividends and looking at the results this quarter you can also see that we're making progress on our path to our long-term targets of return on assets and return on tangible common equity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Bruce will take you through the business activity in the various pages in the slides with some highlights. This quarter again we averaged about 5,000 new customers a day to our mobile banking platform, but importantly the team continues to make progress in bringing that platform into the company in multiple ways. Example of that is this quarter our digital channel sales were up 30% from last year in the second quarter. In addition to that we continue to focus on our mortgage area, our direct to consumer mortgage and home equity originations improved 40% from a year ago. In the mass affluent space our Merrill Lynch product, it continues to have record assets and they were up 15% to over $122 billion and that\u2019s on top of our investment brokerage services revenue teammates in U.S. Trusts and Merrill Lynch that continues to grow.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We also continue to drive our 401(k) business and this year we\u2019ve added some of the industry\u2019s largest companies to our platform. So this is the trends in the business and Bruce will cover more later. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">From a broad economic standpoint what do we see out there, notwithstanding uncertain economies outside United States we see the U.S. economy continues to steadily improve. In our middle market business, our commercial businesses, our company\u2019s balance sheets are strong and they continue to drive loans at a higher rate than they did last quarter. Our consumers continue to spend on our debit and credit cards, this quarter spending about $127 billion this quarter, up 3% from last year even with the down draft in gas prices in the year-over-year comparison. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Our industry leading research team under Candace's leadership and Bank of America research expects U.S. GDP growth for the second half of the year to be 3% for each of those quarters and we see that in our statistics. Our company is well-positioned to benefit from that continued health in the economy and we continue to manage this company to deliver for our customers and clients and for you our shareholders. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">With that, I'll turn it over to Bruce.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><strong>Bruce R. Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Thanks Brian and good morning everyone. I am going to start on slide three, and let\u2019s go through the results.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We recorded $5.3 billion of earnings in the second quarter or $0.45 per diluted share. This compares to $0.27 a share in the first quarter of 2015 and $0.19 in the second quarter of last year. A few items to note as you review the results. In the second quarter, we had $669 million of positive market related adjustments in net interest income, primarily driven by premium amortization on our debt securities from higher long-term rates. This provided a $0.04 benefit to EPS. The quarter also included $373 million in benefits from consumer real estate loans which added $0.02 a share.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">One other item worth noting is the rep and warrant provision which is a net $205 million benefit this period. This was mostly associated with positive developments in legacy mortgage related matters, which I'll discuss later in the presentation. This added a $0.01 to EPS. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Revenue on an FTE basis was $22.3 billion in the second quarter and included the items that I just mentioned. Total non-interest expense in the quarter was $13.8 billion and reflects lower litigation costs, lower LAS costs and good core expense controls compared to both the first quarter of \u201815 and the second quarter of 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Provision for credit losses this quarter was $780 million and included improved net charge-offs on an adjusted basis as well as less reserve release compared to the first quarter of 2015. Return on tangible common equity this quarter was 12.8%, return on assets was 99 basis points and the efficiency ratio was 62%. If we adjust for those metrics for the few items I mentioned earlier, return on tangible common equity was 10.9%, return on assets was 85 basis points and the efficiency ratio was 65%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On slide four, the balance sheet was up less than 1% versus the first quarter of '15 as loan growth and higher securities balances were offset by a decline in the ending balances within our global markets business. Loans on a period end basis were up reflecting good core loan activity. All of our loan categories showed growth from the first quarter of '15 with the exception of consumer real estate, which declined from both discretionary activity as well as other one-offs. Common shareholders\u2019 equity improved, the solid earnings growth was partially offset by a $2.2 billion decline in OCI and $1.3 billion in capital return to common shareholders. We repurchased 49 million shares for $775 million and paid approximately $500 million in common dividends this quarter. Tangible book value increased to $15.02 and tangible common equity improved to 7.6%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">If we look at lending activity on slide five, our reported loans on an end of period basis increased for the first time since the third quarter of 2013 growing $8.5 billion from the first quarter or 4% on an annualized basis. Activity in our discretionary portfolio which is reflected in the LAS and all other box, where we used consumer real estate loans to manage interest rate risk in the LAS unit where we have home equity run-off portfolio together showed a decline from the first quarter of '15 of $15 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">The loan sales I mentioned earlier accounted for roughly half that amount and included certain loans with long-term standby arrangements that were converted into securities. After we exclude this activity, our core loans increased $23.5 billion or 4% from the first quarter of '15. Commercial lending was strong. Among other initiatives, the management team challenged our corporate and commercial lenders for the past several quarters to more fully utilize the credit limits, to drive responsible growth. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In that light, global banking showed a continuation of loan growth from the end of the first quarter of '15, growing $11.4 billion or 4% during the quarter from a mix of C&amp;I across large corporate and middle market as well as growth in commercial real estate.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Our wealth management business continues to experience strong demand in both securities based lending as well as consumer real estate. And our consumer banking area grew both card and auto loans.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We move to regulatory capital on slide six. Under the transition rules our CET1 ratio improved to 11.2% in the second quarter. If we look at our Basel III regulatory capital on a fully phased-in basis, CET1 capital improved $1.1 billion driven by earnings partially offset by the OCI decline, share repurchases and dividends. Under the standardized approach, our CET1 ratio was steady at 10.3% as RWA was stable with the first quarter of '15.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Under the advanced approaches, CET1 ratio increased from 10.1% to 10.4% as RWA improved by approximately $34 billion. Lower counterparty RWA drove this decline and was equally split between three factors. The first, lower derivative exposures, mainly driven by movements in both rates as well as FX. Second, optimization through better collateral management and reductions in certain positions. And third, an increase in the population of trades eligible for model treatment. The balance of the improvement was driven by lower levels of market risk. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In regards to the Fed's requested modifications to models in order to exit the parallel run that we have previously communicated to you, at the end of the quarter we estimate if we made the requested modifications that our advanced approaches CET1 ratio would be approximately 9.3% at June 30th.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Moving to our supplementary leverage ratios we estimate that at the end of the second quarter we continue to exceed the U.S. rules that are applicable in 2018. Our bank holding company SLR ratio was approximately 6.3%, while the primary bank subsidiary BANA was approximately 7%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">If we turn to slide seven, on funding and liquidity, long-term debt of $243 billion was up $6 billion from the first quarter as issuances outpaced maturities. As you can see from the maturity profile we have $10 billion of parent company debt scheduled to mature in the rest of 2015 and we'll continue to be opportunistic in regards to issuance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Our global excess liquidity sources reached a record level during the quarter at $484 billion and now represents 23% of the overall balance sheet. The increase from the first quarter of GELS reflects a continued shift from discretionary loans into HQLA securities as well as the increased debt balances.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Our parent company liquidity increased to $96 billion and our time to required funding improved to 40 months. And at the end of the second quarter we estimate that the consolidated company was well above the 100% fully phased-in 2017 requirement for the liquidity ratio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">If we turn to slide eight, our net interest income on a reported FTE basis was $10.7 billion, an increase of $1 billion from the first quarter of \u201915. Volatility of long end rates over the past few quarters has clearly caused some variability in our reported NII. The market related adjustment from our bond premium amortization this quarter was a benefit of $669 million, as rates rose 40 basis points in the quarter, while in the first quarter of \u201915 we reported a negative $484 million adjustment from a decline in rates in the period. If we adjust for those items our NII declined approximately a $100 million from the first quarter of \u201915 to just over $10 billion, as the impact of lower discretionary balances in consumer loan yields more than offset the impact of one more day of interest.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">At the end of the second quarter an instantaneous 100 basis point parallel shift and increase in rates would be expected to contribute roughly $3.9 billion in NII benefits over the following 12 months and that split roughly 60% to short-end rates and 40% to long-end rates. Given the movement higher in long-end rates, our balance sheet did become less sensitive to long-end rates compared to March 31st as we realized some of that sensitivity through FAS 91 in the second quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As you can see on slide nine, non-interest expense was $13.8 billion in the second quarter and included a $175 million in litigation expense. Litigation expense did decline significantly from the second quarter of \u201914 levels. If we exclude litigation expenses were $13.6 billion in the quarter, a decline of $900 million or 6% from the second quarter of 2014. On balance we\u2019re quite pleased with our year-over-year expense improvement even while we continue to invest in the franchise.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In the third quarter of \u201914 we wrapped up the new BAC cost savings initiatives and several quarters later we continue to see good progress on operating cost reductions in LAS, as well as in other areas. Our headcount is down 7% compared to the second quarter of \u201914 and as a reminder we do expect to incur some cost associated with our CCAR resubmission through the balance of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">If we go ahead and switch to asset quality on slide 10, reported net charge-offs were $1.1 billion versus $1.2 billion in the first quarter of \u201915. Both periods include charge-offs associated with the August 2014 DOJ settlement which we had previously reserved for. If we exclude these impacts and a small impact from recoveries on NPL sales our core net charge-offs declined $75 million from the first quarter of \u201915 to $929 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Loss rates on the same adjusted basis improved to 43 basis points in the second quarter of \u201915. U.S. consumer credit card delinquencies improved as well and on the commercial front we saw an uptick in NPLs and reservable criticized exposure from the first quarter driven by downgrades in oil and gas exposures. Despite these downgrades we feel good about our exposure in this area as they are well collateralized and most of these credits only had a one level migration on a risk rating scale.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">The second quarter provision expense was $780 million and we released a net $288 million in reserves which includes the utilization of previously accrued DOJ reserves. Releases in consumer card and consumer real estate were partially offset by reserve bills within the commercial loan growth area. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Let\u2019s go ahead and move to the businesses on slide 11, Consumer banking had earnings of $1.7 billion which was 4% greater than the second quarter of 2014 and 16% above the first quarter of \u201915 level. This in turn generated a strong 24% return on allocated capital. Within revenue fees were up 2% from last year driven by higher card and higher mortgage banking revenue, but this growth was more than offset by a decline in net interest income. The decline in net interest income is a result of the allocated impact of our ALM activities as well as some compression in card loan yields. Provision decreased $44 million from the second quarter of '14 driven by the continued improvement that we saw in both the credit card as well as the auto portfolios.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Our non-interest expense was down 4% from the second quarter of '14 as we reduced the number of financial centers and associated costs and personnel. The cost of average deposits ratio is now less than a 175 basis points and we have a 57% efficiency ratio within this segment. This business is a good representation of how the company is doing more business while we continue to reduce expenses. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We also continue to experience a shift in consumer behavior patterns away from branches and towards more self-service. For example, the number of mobile banking customers continues to grow and increased to more than $17.6 million customers this quarter and these customers look to mobile devices for approximately 13% of all transactions -- all deposit transactions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">If we look at some of the key drivers and trends within the consumer area on slide 12, we remain a leader in many aspects of consumer banking, doing business with roughly half of all U.S. households. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Let's look at card activity. Card income increased 5% from the second quarter of '14 on strong sales and solid spend levels. Card issuance reached almost $1.3 million units in the quarter on increased sales efforts while the average book FICO score was also strong. Average loan balances were down slightly from the second quarter of '14 as we do see customers paying down more of the balances. Net charge-offs declined from very low levels and were 2.7% in the second quarter and risk adjusted margins remained high at roughly 9%. Mortgage banking income in this segment was up 8% from last year as originations had nice follow through from the elevated pipeline at the end of the first quarter as well as the higher productions margins.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">First mortgage originations for the total company were $16 billion, up 44% year-over-year and up 16% from the first quarter of '15. Home equity line and loan originations increased 23% to $3.2 billion from the year ago quarter and were stable with the first quarter. Revenue improvement versus the second quarter of '14 was driven by improved margins. Although the mortgage pipeline remained solid it is down 15% from the end of the first quarter driven in part by higher rates. Service charges were down modestly versus the second quarter of '14. This fee line item does continue to be somewhat muted as we continue to open higher quality accounts and those accounts are carrying higher balances. Compared to the second quarter of '14 our average deposits of $545 billion are up $31 billion or 6% even as we lowered the rates paid which now stands at five basis points.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Lastly, while we are bringing down our overall headcount in this business, we continue to invest in the growth opportunity of our preferred client base and we've been increasing sales specialists in the financial centers and that's resulted in increased activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">If we turn to slide 13, Global wealth and investment management produced earnings of $690 million, which was up 6% from the first quarter of '15 level but down 5% from the second quarter of '14. Compared to the second quarter of '14 solid fee growth was offset by lower net interest income, higher credit cost and modestly higher expenses, which resulted in a decline in year-over-year results. The allocation of the impact of our company's ALM activities more than offset the NII benefits that we had from solid loan growth within the space. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Year-over-year non-interest income was up 4% on strong asset management results. Non-interest expense was modestly higher in the second quarter on the strength of our asset management fees as well as the continuing investment in client facing professionals. The year-over-year increase in provision reflects larger reserve release in the prior periods. Pretax margin was 24% and the return on allocated capital remained strong at 23%. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">If we look at activity and drivers on slide 14, asset management fees continue to grow and are up 9% from the second quarter of '14. This was partially offset by sluggishness of transactional revenue in the brokerage business. We did increase our financial advisers by 6% over the last 12 months and we feel good about the number of advisers that are joining us from competitors.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Client balances are above $2.5 trillion, up almost $12 billion from the first quarter of '15 driven by solid client balance inflows as well as improved market valuations. Long-term AUM flows were $9 billion for the quarter and that's the 24th consecutive quarter where we've seem positive flows. As I mentioned earlier we continue to experience strong demand in both our securities based and residential mortgage lending areas and we reached a new record for loans within the space during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We turn to slide 15; global banking earnings were $1.3 billion, which is 14% on allocated capital. Earnings did decline 13% from the second quarter of '14 as lower non-interest expense was more than offset by lower net interest income, lower investment banking revenues and higher provision expense that was associated with the strong loan growth that we saw during the quarter. The year-over-year decline in net interest income reflects the allocation of our ALM activity and liquidity costs as well as some compression in loan spreads. Non-interest expense did decline 3% from the second quarter of '14 as lower litigation and other technology initiative costs were partially offset by investment in client-facing personnel. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">If we look at the trends on slide 16, we chart the components of revenue. Investment banking fees for the company were $1.5 billion, down 6% from the near record levels that we experienced during the second quarter of '14. Advisory fees were up 5% during the quarter, debt underwriting was relatively stable as increased activity in the investment grade and other products offset the declines that we saw within our leverage finance area.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Equity underwriting was down 19% from what was a record level for our company in the second quarter of 2014. Outside of investment banking fees other banking revenue declined from leasing gains partially offset by modestly higher treasury fees and card income. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">If we look at the balance sheet, loans on average were $301 billion, up 4% from both the year-over-year and linked-quarter periods. The growth was broad-based across both corporate and commercial borrowers. Although average deposits were relatively stable versus the second quarter of '14 we did see a favorable shift in mix with our non-interest bearing deposits up over $20 billion and our interest bearing deposits down $17 billion versus the second quarter of '14. This growth in non-interest bearing balances was driven by a continuing focus on the growth within operating balances. The decline in interest bearing balances was driven by targeted reductions in these low liquidity value deposits.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Switching to global markets on slide 17, in the second quarter earnings were $1 billion on revenues of $4.3 billion. We generated 11% return on capital in this business during the quarter. Earnings were up modestly from the first quarter of '15 levels, which included higher litigation, but down from the second quarter of '14 as revenue declined. Total revenue, excluding net DVA declined from the second quarter driven by lower equity investment gains, lower sales and trading results and lower investment banking fees. If we exclude a $188 million difference between periods on the sale of an equity investment, revenue was down 4% in the second quarter. Non-interest expense was reduced 5% from that same period, in line with the revenue reductions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">We focused on the sales and trading performance components on slide 18. Sales and trading revenue of $3.3 billion ex-net DVA is down 2% from the second quarter of '14 levels. Compared with the same period a year ago, fixed sales and trading was down 9% and not unlike what we saw in the first quarter of '15 strength within the macro-related products like FX, rates and commodities was offset by lower levels of activity within the credit product space. And to remind you our mix does remain more heavily weighted to credit products based on the size of our new issue business. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Equity's trading was up 13% year-over-year driven largely by increased client activity within the Asia Pacific region as well as a strong performance within the derivative area.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Slide 19 shows our legacy assets and servicing business, where we were profitable during the quarter given the net benefit in our rep and warrant provision. Revenue excluding this benefit did decline from the first quarter of '15 on less favorable MSR hedge performance as well as lower servicing revenue. Litigation expense declined significantly from the second quarter of '14. Non-interest expense ex-litigation was roughly $900 million this quarter improving $122 million from the first quarter of \u201815 and $526 million going back to the second quarter of '14. We remain on track to hit our fourth quarter goal of approximately $800 million in LAS cost ex-litigation. We were also pleased that during the quarter our number of 60 plus day delinquent loans decreased to 132,000 units. That's down 14% from the first quarter and almost 50% from the prior period of last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Before I move away from the mortgage space let me mention an important development in our legacy mortgage exposures. This quarter there was a closely watched case in New York's highest court which confirmed that the New York's six year statute of limitation on filing rep and warrant claims begins to run at the time the reps and warranties are made and not at some later point in time. Based on our review of the relevant documents we believe the vast majority of the bank's remaining PRs representation on warranty obligations are governed by New York law. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">As a result of the case ruling you can see on slide 20, a significant $7.6 billion reduction in our gross outstanding private label claims as a result of certain claims now being time barred. This ruling also had positive implications on our rep and warrant provision, as I mentioned, as well as the range of possible loss above those reserves. You\u2019ll recall the RPL had been a range of up to $4 billion for several years and so that the top end of that range has now been reduced to up to $2 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">On slide 21 we show all other. The $637 million of earnings this quarter resulted in a swing in profitability is a result of the improvement in the NII market related adjustment from quarter-to-quarter as well as the prior period inclusion of the annual retirement eligible incentive cost. The loan sales, I mentioned earlier are also included in revenue. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 29% and I would expect the tax rate to be roughly 30% for the rest of 2015, absent unusual items like the recent UK tax reform proposals. Among the UK proposals where a reduction in the corporate tax rate, a surcharge tax on bank earnings and a reduction in the bank levy rate. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Our preliminary read is that we could have a one-time charge of several hundred million dollars later in this year to re-price our UK deferred tax assets upon enactment. At this time on an ongoing basis we expect the recurring tax impact to be modest. Before wrapping up on this slide, let me remind you that our preferred dividends in the third quarter should be $440 million and $330 million in the fourth quarter of this year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So to wrap up, as Brian started the presentation with, many things that our teams have been focused on for some time came together nicely this quarter and that enabled us to report more than $5 billion in earnings and move closer to our long-term targets. Revenue reflected relative stability. We lowered cost, we grew loans nicely, credit quality remains very good and we're focused on operating leverage within the business. The foundation of the company's balance sheet has never been stronger with record capital and record liquidity levels and we remain well-positioned to benefit from a rising rate environment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">With that, let's go ahead and open it up for Q&amp;A.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p8\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">[Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hi. Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian T. Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">The question I am getting from people this morning is around the expenses. You showed some very nice improvement in core expenses coming down meaningfully Q - on-Q and year-over-year, and the question is have we reached the end stage here or is there any further opportunity to bring down expenses from here?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce R. Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I think that\u2019s in the broadest context we continue to work expenses and if we talk to, about each quarter 18 straight quarter reduction in core operating expenses outside litigation, 15 straight quarters, 3,000 people or more reduction each quarter. So we just continue to apply technology to continue to long-term reduce expenses. So the goal we have in some is to keep the expenses flat as revenue increases and if the world economic situation changes, different what we were expecting we would have to look at it differently but as you can see this quarter that will result in a constant downward pressure given where we are in the economy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay and then on the reps and warranty side you had what looks like a little bit of a true up based on this litigation decision. Is that the right way of reading it or is there potentially even more to come in the future as you go through each case?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce R. Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">No, clearly what the case is significant, is this Betsy we look to add and as do every quarter, look at the rep and warrant provision, and you are right it was a net benefit of $200 million this quarter. I think the important thing; I think more than the $200 million is that if you look back on our slide 20 in the earnings materials the effect of the decision led to two things that do reduce tail risk on a go forward basis. The first is you can see the number of new claims that came was just over $200 million, which is a dramatic improvement from what we\u2019ve seen historically. And second as a result of the time barring of certain claims that the outstanding claims that we have, and keep in mind these outstanding claims are based on original UPB, came down fairly significantly to just below $19 billion. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So while it was nice to have the modest benefit that we did in the quarter, I think importantly on a go forward basis it does reduce the tail risk, that\u2019s out there and we saw some of the benefits from that in the activity level this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay thanks. And then just one last question, you indicated the upside that you have in the event of rate rise, $3.9 billion if the parallel shift is 100 basis points, the question is how you are thinking about dropping that to the bottom line? Is there reinvestments that would take up some of that or are you at sufficient run rate in investment spends that you would be able to drop more to the bottom line?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce R. Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I think there is no question Betsy as we look at and I just remind people that we were at $3.9 billion for 100 basis point move. If you look at that roughly 60% of it\u2019s on the short end now 40% of it\u2019s on the long end and there is no question that we would expect to drop a significant portion of that to the bottom line if and when we see that 100 basis point move.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. And then just back to the expense side the expense run rate that you\u2019ve got right now is something you think you can hold, at least if not improve from here, is that fair?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian T. Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yeah. That\u2019s really in your last question we\u2019ve been investing in headcount to open up our customer facing capacity, so I replicated some of statistics earlier. So we are comfortable from a technology spend rate from an investment client facing capacity, marketing and everything we had a good run rate so there will be downward pressure as headcount continues to come down through the application of technology across the platform of customers and internally. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So we\u2019re comfortable that we can continue to drive it, and make no bones about it this is what we work on every day and we are yet to put out a dollar target because frankly that tells the team we\u2019ve made a goal and stop as opposed to just get better at it every day. So we just want that we are constantly working to improve the dynamics of revenue versus expense in this company.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thanks a lot.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And we\u2019ll take our next question from Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew D. O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Good morning. If you look at the core net interest income ex the market related marks, it was down little bit versus last quarter but you are starting to see loans inflect as you mentioned earlier. Do we start seeing stability in the core net interest income looking at the next quarter or two or do we really need higher short-term rates for that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian T. Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">No, thanks for the question. It\u2019s a good question. I think if you look at, we typically have a little bit of seasonal pressure in the second quarter and as we sit here today, based on the curve we would expect to see the core net interest income, which obviously excludes FAS 91 move up from Q2 to Q3 and we\u2019d expect further growth from Q3 to Q4. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew D. O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay and that\u2019s without any benefit from rates?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian T. Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">It\u2019s just based on the realization of what the existing curve is, which quite frankly we don\u2019t look at and our models don\u2019t show fed funds going up until January of 2016. So there\u2019s not a lot of great benefit in that at all. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew D. O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay, and then on the discretionary book you mentioned it came down a little bit, when you look on a combined securities, mortgages basis and I guess as we saw long term rates go up and some banks have been increasing the discretionary book, with higher reinvestment rates or higher investment rates herein, what\u2019s your thought on bringing that book down as rates have gone up?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian T. Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay, two comments, I think. The first is that when we talk about the discretionary balances coming down that\u2019s basically the whole loan portfolio as well as certain pieces of the home equity portfolio. So we referenced that those came down about $15 billion quarter-over-quarter; half due to the sales and half due to pay downs. We probably have one more quarter where you will see some of the conversion of those loans to securities. But if you actually look at the amount of securities from a balance perspective they went up a little bit Q1 to Q2 based on the conversion of those loans to securities and as we continue to see the deposit footprint grow we will continue to invest and we\u2019re obviously mindful of the balance between increasing net income interest, like I spoke about as well as being sensitive to OCI risk. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew D. O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay, thank you very much. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian T. Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Thank you. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Our next question is from Jim Mitchell from Buckingham Research. Your line is open. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Hey, good morning. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian T. Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Good morning. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Just a quick follow up on the NIM outlook, I think first, Bruce last quarter you mentioned that the yield curve stayed where it was, you talked about $600 million of drag in NII over the next few quarters. Are you saying that that\u2019s pretty much changed with this deepening of the curve since April, when you spoke last, and not only NII is growing but NIM should stabilize or is it just sort of offsetting each other, or you are getting a boost from that, how do we think about the yield curve versus your prior comment?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce R. Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yeah, I think again, as we look and step forward that there are a lot of things that influence that number, one is obviously the ability and how much we\u2019ve put up the increase in deposits to work through growing loans, and clearly we\u2019ve seen, during the second quarter we saw that loan growth move up, which is obviously a good thing, which lessens some of that sensitivity. And as we look at the amount and what we\u2019re doing from an investment portfolio that there is less to do during the second half of the year. So all-in-all as we look at those different factors it\u2019s why we\u2019re comfortable saying that we\u2019d expect the quarter increase both Q2 to Q3 as well as from Q3 to Q4. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">That\u2019s fair enough. And just on the capital side, when do you think the modifications become official and you exit the parallel run, how long do we think we have to wait for that and is there anything that could change in terms of your expectation around I guess the 90 basis point hit to your CT1?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce R. Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I think, I\u2019d say that we can\u2019t say too much about regulatory matters. I think given the updated disclosure we have given you can assume that we\u2019re getting closer to having that result. You never know until you\u2019re ultimately done. But we feel very comfortable with the guidance of 9.3% factoring in the adjustments based on where we were at the end of the second quarter and we\u2019ll look to get that wrapped up sooner than later. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay, that\u2019s helpful and just one last quick one on the $3.9 billion of sensitivity to higher rates, how much is FAS 91 related versus for the core?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce R. Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Sure, as I mentioned roughly 40% of its long end which is a $1.5 billion of the amount and roughly half of that\u2019s FAS 91 and half of it\u2019s non-FAS 91 related. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay, thanks a lot. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Our next question is from John E. McDonald from Bernstein. Your line is open. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John E. McDonald </span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Hi, thanks. Bruce, just one more question on the rate sensitivity, the $3.9 billion move for a 100 basis point parallel move, I assume that illustration is to a 100 basis points move, that\u2019s a shock or an instantaneous move in rates. Can you give us any feel for how that number would change if the move in rates is more gradual, as the Fed is kind of saying if I go gradually, how does that change if it's not instantaneous?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce R. Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Well, I mean ultimately overtime if you get to the 100 basis point number you have that. I think your point is, is that, if they move 25 basis points, is it 25% or is it more than 25%. And I think that the thing you have you to keep in mind, and we've talked about it a lot with what we would expect from a deposit re-pricing perspective, is that, that clearly you'd expect the first 25 to 50 basis points move up that we would not have to do much from a deposit perspective. So net-net on a relative basis that should be a positive as you look at the numbers. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John E. McDonald </span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay, and then a clarification, where is the gain on consumer real-estate loans, is that in the mortgage banking line?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce R. Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">No, it's in other income. And it's reflected in the all other segment. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John E. McDonald </span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. The mortgage banking income was very strong and the fee income line obviously had the rep and warrant in there. Was there anything else in there that helped on the mortgage banking line? </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce R. Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I would say that generally that the hedge results on the MSR were fairly decent in the quarter and then you can see, like we said there just wasn\u2019t much litigation during the quarter as well. So all of those things led to the results being where they are. But you're right that we've typically had 100 to 200 of rep and warrant provision and we had 200 benefits that you get a sense of the magnitude of the swing on a comparable period basis. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John E. McDonald </span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Got it, got it, okay. And then last question from me on the credit, do you see the net charge offs kind of dancing around the current level, the $929 million. And how you see it playing out in terms of provision, reserve release relative to what you just did this quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce R. Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yeah, I think this quarter I think you're seeing kind of a continuation of what we've been talking about. And I want to be careful that we're -- particularly we need to exclude DOJ book both on the top, as you did in your 929 number as well as in the reserve release. So if you back out what we had for DOJ the reserve release was about 150. The charge-offs of $929 million were down roughly $75 million. And while this can bounce around a little bit I think what you're likely to see over the next couple of quarters is probably a convergence where the charge-offs and the provision number become more closely aligned. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And I would just say that particularly on the consumer side we continue to like what we see on credit. And on the commercial side you can see that the charge-offs are virtually nil within the large corporate space. And there is nothing that we see out there that's going to change that materially. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John E. McDonald </span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay, and on top of that will the DOJ still be a factor for next couple of quarters? </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce R. Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">As it relates to that I want to think John that it will be in the $100 million type area, as it relates to both charge-off and reserve release. And then by the time we get to the fourth quarter it should virtually go away. It can bounce around a little bit, but it should largely be gone by the end of the third quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian T. Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">But it's pares off John. So the way you expect this quarter to continue. So you know it\u2019s a number that\u2019s offset by our previously established reserve. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John E. McDonald </span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Got it, okay. Thank you. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce R. Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And our next question is from Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Hi, thanks. Two quick ones on the average balance sheet. When you look at the debt securities line, the yields went up some [indiscernible] lot from 2% to 3.2%. I'm assuming some of that is LAS loans converting. But could you give a little color on what drives that because the overall size of those book didn\u2019t change that much. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce R. Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yeah, it's interesting if you look year-over-year and you adjust for FAS 91, which shows up in the NII, when you're looking back at the table, that the yields were almost identical from the second quarter of '14 to the second quarter of '15 once you make that 91 adjustment. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr </span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay, similar but different question. Inside the C&amp;I book, the used commercial book, it was just a four basis point drop quarter-on-quarter but there is growth there. So I'm just curious the trade-off between price and yield give up on the new loans you're putting on versus the responsible growth you've talked about, doesn't seem that bad. I'm just curious on what kind of yield you're putting new loans on. </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce R. Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Sure, and I think when you look at commercial loan spreads, there are two things that those numbers reflect, I think that there is -- the first thing which is just from a macro perspective that has been a little bit of compression, although, we're seeing it slow is it relates to just the competitive landscape and where the loans are getting done. As it relates to your question about the new loans, the responsible growth, if you looked and particularly in the areas that picked up during the second quarter, that on our risk rating scale they would translate to credits that tend to be in the strong triple B or single A area. So they are largely investment grade type credits where we are extending it. And if you look at average spreads in that area they tend to be in the LIBOR plus 150 type area on average, which is a little bit lower than the average across the commercial platform, but as you can see the credit\u2019s clearly at the upper end.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian T. Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So Glenn, broadly stated, if you think about it, we are not -- on a credit structure we held our discipline. On price there has been pressure but you then you have to look at that whole relation [ph] basis with the other fees and revenue you get from cash management stuff and we try to [ph] have our client focused discipline to it, but your observation is right, there is little pressure on those spreads due to that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr </span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay, I definitely appreciate that. Last one is when you talk about the pushing for growth and you mentioned the difference specialists in the branches, the business banking, the financial investment consultants, I am curious what are you doing to incent them, to encourage them, in other words are there actual incentives or do they get paid on the productions?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian T. Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">In the sales context there is -- there are incentives for production, but it has to be done the right way with the right customers and with the right structure. So it is not -- it doesn\u2019t drive their behavior. It\u2019s different than the wealth management business in terms of the balance between incentives but if they are okay to open -- the mortgage loan officers are paid to produce mortgages and to open up checking accounts and other things. But it\u2019s really, it\u2019s actually deploying the people and building the capacity to sell, as we are reducing the need for services through all the automation that\u2019s going on and then shifting that group of people so that, it\u2019s really just having more of them then think of it as incentive driven behavior. </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And then really then, having the information at the point of a sale through our technology, offers that have been made to people for credit cards and et cetera, so that you can make the offer again, that\u2019s already been made to them, on mine [ph] or something. So it\u2019s commonly just sales practice is more people and then just the discipline of the team, Tom, Glenn and Dean [indiscernible], then it would be incentive driven.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr </span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">All right, thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Our next is from Eric Wasserstrom from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Thanks very much. Just to follow up a little bit on that last point, when I was trying to shift through the core loan growth numbers this morning, it looked like the core loan growth coming out of the institutional bank and the wealth management looks strong. But the -- I am still unclear what the core level of growth was inside the consumer organization and so I am just trying to reconcile that with where the incremental hiring is occurring on the sales front. So could you just clarify what the core level of customer growth was?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian T. Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Well, if you look at -- I think in the consumer on page five you can see the balances, then you can see the different pieces. We have changed our practice of how we book residential mortgages for our consumer customers, that had impact on that, but overall remember they are still fighting a couple -- we are still fighting a couple of things in consumer, one is the card balances have probably [ph] stabilized and you saw it from our first quarter, second quarter a slight uptick there. That\u2019s because we had -- we\u2019ve been hitting increasingly record sales of credit card, so I think we did about $1.3 million this quarter, Bruce. That is again a record for us since we changed the business model six-seven years ago. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And if you look at things like the home equity balances and things like that, those were under pressure just because we are still seeing significant repayments even though we are producing a lot in that area. So if you look at that you can see it\u2019s across the board just little bit upside still, in part the interplay between some of the run off in the other category and the build-up in residential but they do a lot more themselves, loans in that place and so the investment sales levels that drives that Merrill Edge, in fact the FSA and the branches that we deploy do $4 million of notional on average a month of new investment products in building $4 million to $5 million, they sell, obviously check accounts, net check-in accounts this quarter we had a net check-in account growth position even taking into account the run off from divestitures and other things, and then you have the loan side. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So they are responsible for driving all that and so it shows up in the loans a little bit, that\u2019s why the fee categories are stable in other areas.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And so do you have a sense or is there some sense maybe Brian you can give us to how that investment in sort of front office staff is contributing to growth outside of the segment?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian T. Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Well -- in the small business arena, the first half of the year we get about $5 billion of originations in what the -- what we would define the small business, we have across two divisions and they helped grow that. Merchant services growth it fell, that goes into the business banking segment -- the global banking segment. And they send [ph] about 20,000 customers here in the wealth management, that literally walk in our branch are wealthy and they get moved over and that helps our wealth management business. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So you can think of them - you're right that sales force -- that [ph] segment that it has a benefit across the board, and then services, a lot of our customers business, business banking, commercial banking customers coming to the branches obviously for cash related, really to the cash management revenue.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So it is across the board and contributes and so the good news is they are making more money than they may have last year on their own. But it's still providing that services and capabilities across the platform.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And so and this is just my final question, with the -- if we divorce just the run off from some of the legacy asset that's still occurring, would you expect the core consumer asset growth to accelerate as a consequence of this investment or do you think that it's currently run rating [ph]?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian T. Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">The run off subsides in the consumer category, this is consumer banking here and then you've got the LAS piece, the LAS will continue to grow down because frankly those products we put in there -- we could decide not to do it but in consumer you should see as its stabilizes you will see a little better loan growth but remember they've focused on the response, of our responsive growth. We're not going to open up the credit card business in a way that will produce charge offs later down the road that we won't be happy with. So we are driving that growth into the core strong credit quality that we want to have in this company and [indiscernible] assuming that this leads to because to do that you have go in the credit postures that we won\u2019t do.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce R. Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And I would just add if I may, if you look at home equity it's a good example of where, if you look within the consumer banking space and during the second quarter of this year the home equity originations of line amounts were about $3.2 billion. They were to loan to value less than 60%. FICOs deep into the 700s, and so there were more than $3 billion of those booked. That\u2019s number one market share, roughly a $1.5 billion of that was funded but you do have some of the legacy stuff that running off. So I think when you wonder about activity levels and what's happening, I think you need to realize that with that number one share and what we are doing it is growing. It\u2019s just there is a run off that mutes that effect.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Great, thanks very much for the answers to my question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce R. Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Our next question is from Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ken Usdin </span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Thanks, good morning. First question just on the RWA, looks like when you look at the reconciliation of the move to fully phased-in, there's a little bit of a help on the advanced models this quarter. I just, in a general sense obviously we still have that finalization to come but what additional tweaks that you are working on inside the modules and what additional mitigation could we still see from here on the RWA side?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce R. Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Ken, if I may, there are couple of things. We are obviously working hard to move there\u2019s many of the exposures from CEM treatment to IMM treatment, which generally has had favorable benefit there. The second thing I talked about better collateral management as well as looking to work, to do more compression and to net things out and we continue to see some benefit there. The third is we continue to move out and we're largely through this but as we continue to move out some of the non-performing consumer real estate as well as the benefits of improved consumer credit quality we're seeing benefits there and there are still a lot of few RMBS and other type positions that we would expect to get benefit for over the next couple of quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So I think that this quarter was clearly a quarter between the activity that we undertook as well as what happened from a rates and FX perspective where we saw pretty good quarter-over-quarter improvement and obviously there was not only in the markets business but also in the consumer businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian T. Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">That's said, Bruce the other thing, we have a healthy dose of operating capital due to the operating risk embedded from the country wide [ph] and other things that we have to figure out over time, how we can work through the system because we never did the activities in the company. But on the other hand we had to deal with the cost of them and so both operating and general. So as you think about that longer-term we have to get the more rational deal, or better offering result to the company today which is different, but that will take time, and working through the models there too.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ken Usdin </span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay and then my second question, this just relates to the wealth management business and Bruce you alluded to there being a little bit of a slow down on the revenue. So if I look at the segment or the line item on the income statement, there has been a deceleration, advisor productivity looks a little bit lower and you've added a lot of people, you have added a lot of assets. So I'm just wondering what do we need to see to get a re-acceleration of the revenue side and brokerage and wealth management and is it -- or is it just the time lag relative to those additions?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce R. Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Couple of points in that. I think first that there is clearly a building up of advisors, particularly if we're bringing them in and training them, that there is a ramp up in productivity that occurs. I don't think there is any question. The second thing that I do think is important is that when you look at the net interest income line, that as I've mentioned it looked a little bit muted. If you saw gross loan net interest income you would see those increasing. </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So some of the push out of the ALM activities has muted the NII line a little bit. And then the third thing which you referenced that I do think is a little bit more of a trend that and I think is not only -- is somewhat consistent with some of the regulatory standards which we're seeing more and more of the assets that we manage being managed on a long term basis, where we were managing them, and so that's leading to growth in the asset management fees. And the corollary to that is that you do have lower brokerage income. But net-net you can see that we are growing in the segment and we feel good about the activity that we are seeing there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian T. Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yeah, I say, a few quarters we saw the margin, the pretax margin come down and you are seeing it start to turn back and go up, and there is positive pressure on the future on that after the end of this year because some of the deal stuff runs out will add a couple of points to margin. It\u2019s in the numbers this year, but won\u2019t be in the numbers next year. And then your point as the maturity of the investment cycle, so because we are adding the financial advisors, the folks are coming in, they are building the books and as that maturity happens you\u2019ll see it get a little better. But the encouraging signs we\u2019re seeing the margin come back up. And remember this business also benefits a lot by the rate changes too ultimately, it is a -- it\u2019s a big bang. It\u2019s got $250 billion deposits, round numbers, a lot of loans and it has a lot of the same sensitivity our consumer bank does, that people don't think of in this context. </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So as we think about the comp structure is in place, but there is added deal piece that runs off. You are seeing the maturity cycle that people coming up and the team is just working hard on the revenue expense management and we start to see some better signs. They got some work to do still left. </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ken Usdin </span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Understood. Okay, thanks guys.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce R. Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Our next question is from Steven Chubak from Nomura. Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Hey, good morning. So I have a couple of questions on the topic of capital. The first is a follow-up to Ken's earlier question regarding RWA mitigation potential and Bruce, I do appreciate the color you cited relating to all the mitigation opportunities on the horizon. I'm just trying to get a better sense, given your efforts to grow the core loan portfolio, how we should be thinking about the trajectory in advance RWAs? Maybe excluding the upward adjustment tied to regulatory guidance. Just to give us a sense as to what that trajectory should look like over the next couple of quarters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce R. Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Let\u2019s make the caveat that this assumes that we don't have a significant change one way or -- in market conditions because obviously there is a part of Basel III, that\u2019s somewhat pro-cyclical. But I think net-net if we do a good job of managing this the way that we would expect to, that absent any exogenous changes we should be able, in the institutional business, which is both global banking as well as sales and trading, that we should be able to grow loans while at the same time having -- have reductions in the overall risk weighted assets that are attributed to that area. </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Now where you will probably see it be more dollar-for-dollar is obviously under standardized those loans tend to be -- every dollar of loan is a dollar of RWA. So you have to be a little bit careful between which method you are looking at.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay, well presumably the focus, at least on your part is going to be on mitigating the advance RWAs given that, that appears to be your longer term binding constraint?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce R. Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">It\u2019s both, because you\u2019re right, as it relates to a ratio pro forma for this, it is the lower number but keep in mind you have to keep the focus on standardized as well because at least based on last year\u2019s CCAR, as well as guidance that\u2019s out there, standardized is very important from a CCAR perspective. </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I understood, okay, and actually it\u2019s a great transition to my next question, on the topic of G-SIB surcharges, where I'm sure you\u2019re aware there\u2019s been some discussion around the possibility of incorporating the surcharges within CCAR and I was just hoping to get a better sense as to what contingency plans you might have in place if the surcharges were to be included and are there opportunities that you see to sufficiently mitigate the G-SIB indicators so that you could move into a lower bucket?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce R. Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">A couple of things on that front, the first is as it relates to G-SIBs, their application, where they may or may not be used, at this point while we participate in industry forums, I think that the supervisory has been very transparent in sharing much of the same things that they share with us, you\u2019re also aware of. So I think that the information is fairly disseminated amongst everyone. </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">As it relates to contingency planning it\u2019s really an ongoing continuation of what we did from 2013 to 2014, which if you recall is it related to our qualitative CCAR results in a timeframe where we didn\u2019t have significant levels of net income, that our CCAR cushion grew significantly and so what are we doing to focus on that, on the investment portfolio we\u2019re mindful of managing OCI risk given that it flows through the overall CCAR process.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">We continue to be very focused on moving out those loans and those assets that have higher loss content and at the same time making sure that the originations that we put on are of the highest quality. So we continue to focus on that. If you look at the overall risk that\u2019s being taken within the market\u2019s business, we\u2019re managing that, so that there\u2019s not a surprise as it relates to that. And clearly we continue to work hard to move out those exposures that have high loss content there. </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So, yeah I think it\u2019s really much more but a continuation of the work that we\u2019ve been at for several years now, and we\u2019re mindful of making sure that we continue to push that stuff out at the same time that we\u2019re originating those things that will perform well as part of that overall exercise. </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">All right, thanks Bruce that detail is extremely helpful. And then one more quick final one from me, I was hoping you can give us an update on where your T-LAC ratios sit today?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce R. Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Yeah, I think that the T-LAC ratio, as it relates to where we are, and this assumes that we exclude stuff that\u2019s less than a year; I think that the T-LAC ratio is roughly 21% at this point. We\u2019ll have to see the deducts that come in and out of that based on G-SIB and other things but I think we\u2019re just below 21% at the end of the quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay, great. Thank you for taking my questions. </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce R. Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Thank you. </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Our next question is from Brennan Hawken from UBS. Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken </span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Quick one on wealth management. Is it possible for you to quantify for us how much of your total wealth management client assets are in retirement accounts and of that what percentage are advisory?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian T. Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">We\u2019ll get back, I don\u2019t have that up off the top of my head, in terms of -- I just don\u2019t have that off the top of my head.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken </span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay, just the whole idea there is just trying to get at the DOL proposal and maybe what could be potential downside even based on how it all gets finalized understanding that it\u2019s preliminary at this point?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian T. Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Yeah, [indiscernible] tell you on that. </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken </span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay, and then looking at the branch declines that you guys referenced earlier, is the tweak on the sort of 5% year-over-year, as a reasonable decline rate sustainable from here given the trends that you\u2019re seeing in your mobile platform and could this potentially add additional GUs [ph] to your expense decline beyond the business as usual type pushing that you guys spent a lot of time talking about here in the call today. </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian T. Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So let\u2019s step back and make sure that what we understand one thing. It\u2019s the idea is they were moving because the customers are moving and how they conduct business. So you've got to run your changes consistent with what they're doing. And that's a base line that you have to stick to. If you forget that you can overshoot or undershoot frankly. And so -- and so that being said, that's one point. </p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Second point is in the 6,100 branches that we had at the peak down to this level, there are multiple things we are doing, customer behavior changes, change in the configuration of the market we attack, et cetera. So there are lots of elements. So now you're more in a business as usual ongoing practice, which will really be driven more by the customer behavior as opposed to some view point we have about markets and arranging the franchise. So I'd expect that they will continue to work themselves down. I wouldn't predict a steady rate because to it's a very composite [ph] equation. </p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">But then let\u2019s split what's really going on, as Bruce talked about earlier we have 17.6 million mobile users, we have 31 million bank -- computer banking users. That number is actually growing again, for a while was kind of flattish, is actually growing. So it's interesting that that's happening. 60% of our sales are all digital now, about 6% of the sale that are digital which is computers and mobile, or mobile and that's growing at 300%. So it's catching up. And then you get things that are interesting because it grows the efficiency of branch. </p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">There are about 10,000 appointments scheduled in the mobile device a week at the branch, that allows us [ph] to have a more efficient branch structure, even though we may have less, we may have bigger branches because you have more sales going on in them. So think about that, that's up from 2,000 last year second quarter, 10,000 times a week now and growing at that rate implied there. People are scheduling appointments to come see us, which is a lot better experience for us and them to serve themselves, allows us to have our staffing levels down. Bruce referenced the check deposit are 13% of all checks. So the activity of all this is critical to that question. </p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">So I won't give you a 5% reduction or 4% reduction, or any mathematical equation we have done. But I'll be careful about assuming it will be that ratable but it would be more based on behavior change. But the key is our customers scores have gone up overall and even in mobile channels we've gone up year-over-year a 1000 basis points on our mobile channel top of the box satisfaction. So it will be a complex thing. </p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">It's an integrated pool of capabilities, phones, online ATA at branches. And you'd expect it to be pressured going down, but remember we were early into this and if you think about 1,400 branches, that's bigger than a lot of companies out there already have a system. So we've been at this for a long time and we will do it the right way because if you push too hard to you will hurt the clients. </p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken </span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">That's helpful, color, Brian, thanks. And then last one from me, you made reference earlier to a couple of points margin from the employee forgivable loan, amortization dropping off next year. Is that, is next year sort of a bump in the trend or is that indicative of potential further declines in forgivable loans as they continue to roll off. And does it assume some level of counter pressure offsetting pressure from continuing recruiting. And maybe a little update on the recruiting environment for us, guys will be helpful. </p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian T. Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yeah, what I'm referencing is discrete away from the entire recruiting process. This is a setup at a time where that transaction for a group of people at that time. And it just came in over the years and it's not just the last year but it goes beyond [ph]. The forgivable loan factors and all the other stuff recruiting is a little different thing. But John Keith Banks and the team, they're successful recruiting on the experience level. The attrition for the top two quintile for financial advisors is at an all-time low. I think again it\u2019s run about 2% [ph] or something like that. So we're retaining those and we are recruiting at the both, experienced level. </p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">But importantly what is obvious to us is to drive the amount of client need here, to drive to get the client need which is huge and underserved in our beliefs. We had to create more advisors than there out there. And so we've really worked hard on the [indiscernible] and training program which is basically bring deeper business experience out there for us, to bring them into our firm and also other industries into our firm. And that is now, we think reaping benefits to us, we have been working on it two or three years, retool and drive it. </p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">So you should expect our advisor counted to go up and our productivity may come down per advisor. But frankly there is a lot of business where, remember [indiscernible] per advisors is a million in spends. And so bringing it down a little bit to get a lot more growth and a lot more growth in advisors would not be -- would be a great trade for our company. So our recruiting is strong, we're net -- doing a decent job, sort of hire and you hear a lot about. </p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">That is not a big part of the advisor count, several hundred a year, like probably 200 to 300 but with the drive of our advisor and capabilities of our client there\u2019s a broader build out of the team switch the BFAs and T&amp;Ds that work at the branches on cases and grow the people in there. That just were down to our benefit overtime, although it's had a little drag on profitability right now it's the best. </p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken </span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Great, thanks for that. </p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Our next question is from Marty Mosby from Vining Sparks. Your line is open. </p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Thank you. I wanted to ask about the asset liability management. When you look at the market adjustments that you had at $669 million this quarter, as rates go up there is less and less impact from that. How much is remaining in the next 50 basis points in just the prepayment speed slowing down? </p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce R. Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Yeah, I don't have 50 basis points Marty, but the number we quoted was on a 100 basis point move the FAS 91 benefit would be $775 million. </p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay, perfect. And then when you're talking about the -- being able to see the margin go up in the back half of the year, because of the current steepness of the yield curve, does that include some utilization in the sense of increasing your securities portfolio while you invest some of the liquid assets that you have on the balance sheet?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce R. Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">There is clearly some of that, because we would expect as we go forward with the comp position of the balance sheet that there will be incremental cash to, that's generated. Obviously some of that goes into loan growth and some of it goes into the investment portfolio. So they're embedded in that. Those comments is an assumption that there will be a little bit more to be invested. </p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And you mean it will range $10 million, $20 million, $30 million, what's the -- any kind of rule of thumb there? </p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce R. Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I would think of it as on the low end of that, during the third quarter and a comparable amount in the fourth. And there is one other thing that I did want to correct, that I said earlier that if you look at the securities balances yields, the stability that we saw once you adjust for FAS 91 was Q1 to Q2. </p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Got you. And lastly, this is a new launch. But when you look at the trading activity, typically in the past when I had a trading activity in the bank that I was managing, when you have a steepening of the yield curve, you get some pickup as you get in the current long term yield funded by short term rates. The rate on the trading activity account did not go up this quarter but averaging into the next quarter would you expect some benefit there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce R. Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I think if you look at -- I think the important thing is that there is -- so that rate tends to manifest itself in the market based NII. There are lot of things that drive that, when rates move around as much as they have. But I don't think there is any question that overtime as you're in an increasing rate environment that there is a part of the yield component that flows through NII that you would expect to get a little bit better. </p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">I\u2019m just more focused on the steepness versus the flattening of the yield curve. A steeper yield curve typically brings little better spread of the trading account. </p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce R. Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">It would, but the question is it will -- yeah it works this way true but it is -- if you look across long periods of time it's relatively constant. </p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Okay, thanks. </p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Our next question is from Nancy Bush from NAB Research. Your line is open. </p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Nancy Bush </span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Hi, good morning. Guys just another liquidity issue. Could you just tell us what's on deposit, what excess deposit you've got with the Fed now and what are your plans are for those going forward? </p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce R. Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Okay, at any one point in time it can move around, but you should assume it\u2019s comfortably about a$100 billion excuse me, that's on the Fed in any one night during the quarter. And I think that when you look at where we are with LCR, where we are, both the parent as well as the bank, and I think in $484 billion of overall liquidity, which is a record that we feel were in a reasonable place. And I don't see significant changes going forward Nancy. </p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Nancy Bush </span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Okay, you mean an overall liquidity or liquidity on deposit with Fed?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce R. Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Probably both.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Nancy Bush </span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Okay. That\u2019s a lot of liquidity? My second question Brian is for you. I mean you've gone through a lot of change over the past few years and this transition of mobile et cetera, et cetera but one of the things I still get from talking to people are persistent gripes about service quality, particularly in the mortgage company. Can you just tell us what your internal polling or whatever shows in terms of improvements in credit quality and how do you feel about that entire subject?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian T. Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">I think in the mortgage business that for example the funds, the bank originators we're number one in J. D. Power survey and I think we are number two or three overall mortgage company. So I think in terms of originating mortgage [indiscernible] getting steeper, Ron Sturzenegger [ph] has gotten that platform settled in and you will get momentary spikes where refi\u2019s bump up and things slowdown. From a getting it all done, from a keeping our credit quality, where we want it, that ends up with us having some noise around people we don't get mortgages. So we get the 15 [ph] that we did this quarter, 30% of its low moderate incomes so we are still serving that segment. But again we are not pushing for better terms in mortgage and I think you\u2019d understand Nancy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Nancy Bush </span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Yeah. But how about just more the issue of service quality at the branches et cetera?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian T. Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Well if you look our customer scores continue to rise and -- almost on monthly basis in the broadest context of brand and part of that\u2019s due to what happens at the branch, part of it\u2019s also due to this stuff going on around the company and that's gone from the low point in fourth quarter 2009 it rose fairly steadily, so it\u2019s been back to within 95% of where it was at its highest point in 2005 and '06. So that we are satisfied. If you actually go to the customer who actually get served, when you measure all the channels, which we measure with tens of thousands of customers a week, and the month you find that those scores continue to go up and the top two box score, I think were in the 70s to 80s at the various channels and including mortgage. </p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">So I think because we just have a lot of customers you will find out once in a while we will bump [ph] up in our jobs. But if you think about, we've added mortgage production, check-in accounts, net new, the credit cards and that\u2019s -- the ramification that we give service and driving it the team has continued to work at it. We're not perfect and while we will get better, but I think if you look at it last three or four years it\u2019s continued to get better.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Nancy Bush </span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">All right, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian T. Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">And by the way if you look at our deposit growth it continues to accelerate and over the top of CDs continued to run of year-over-year to $10 billion. So we are up $31 billion in deposits in consumer year-over-year. I think it is in CDs are probably down another $10 billion or so. So think about that, if people didn't like us a lot they wouldn't be giving us their core check-in accounts and that is happening more and more every quarter and that we will service well as rates change because we are a hugely primary focused check-in account company in the broad mass part of the business, which is different than the past.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Nancy Bush </span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">All right. Good to hear. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Your next question is from Mike Mayo from CLSA. Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael L. Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Hi, I just wanted a follow up on Betsy\u2019s question, at the start talking about expenses being at a run rate or maybe going lower. The expenses are down $400 million year-over-year. But if you look at your four business lines, the revenues were down twice that, implying a lot of the rest is coming through the other lines. I guess I'm just wondering how much more there is to cut, or should cut if the expenses are down again a quarter of million. But the revenues in the core business lines down $800 million. How do you balance that trade off?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce R. Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">I think the first thing that you have to keep in mind, Mike when you quote the numbers within the business is on a year-over-year basis you have two significant things happening. You've had FAS 91 and the significant movement in rate as it relates to push out of those charges as well as, as we push the LCR out to the businesses that from a reported segment perspective that has a significant impact. And so I think as we've gone through the presentation that the numbers that I would focus on are very much what's going on within the segments, looking at the fee income lines because there is activity from a net interest income perspective of greater activity within the businesses. </p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">So I'd be a little bit careful with that characterization and I think in that context I go back to Brian's initial comments which we continue to push hard, we\u2019re adding client facing personnel across the company at the same time we are reducing aggregate headcount and that\u2019s leading to declines in the expense numbers, and we\u2019re very, very focused on continuing to keep that balance as we go forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael L. Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Okay. Just to understand because I am looking at your slides, slide 17 and the other slides in your presentation deck, looked at the four slides, related to GWIM, Global Banking, Global Markets, Consumer Banking, I took second quarter of 2015 versus second quarter of 2014 and looked at the delta in revenues and that\u2019s how I got the $800 million decline, so you would say which adjustment should we make from that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian T. Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Let\u2019s just take -- we will take GWIM because I have got that number on the top of my head, Mike. I think year-over-year the difference in GWIM NII allocation through this sort of [indiscernible] and those things is, Bruce how much\u2026?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce R. Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Yes, let\u2019s just go through relative to the second quarter of \u201814 you have got consumer from an overall NII impact was more than $200 million, GWIM was as Brian said roughly $130 million, overall investment bank, our global banking was a couple of hundred million and then you have the minimus amounts within markets in LAS.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian T. Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">So that is nothing more than us changing the allocation method. It\u2019s because of LTR things becoming important, so we push down the business to get the behavior of the businesses aligned with the parent. So this is why you have to be a little careful about micro assessing these movements because things change and the methodology year-over-year and we don\u2019t go back and restate this, we didn\u2019t do it last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael L. Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Okay. I will follow up on that. So just are you comfortable, are you satisfied with the revenue progression that you have had, no matter how you take a look at it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian T. Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">We are satisfied that we are starting to see the hard work of all our teammates come through but we are not satisfied in the sense that we expect better performance on both the revenue expense line in the future. We said that we\u2019ll keep working at it, but if you look at it over the last several quarters we\u2019ll see the stability in revenues but continued work on expenses both in the dollars but also the headcount, you have \u201815 straight quarters, 3,000 or more personnel reductions per quarter is a pretty strong record that shows that we are disciplined [in cutting costs].</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael L. Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">And then a separate question, I think it\u2019s first time you have listed ROA and ROE on the first page of your press release and should we read anything into that, that you are more focused on achieving these targets with a specific time frame or kind of what changed?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian T. Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">It maybe the pagination. It\u2019s been listed, in our documents consistently Mike so... We are all focused on those goals and we\u2019ve told you that last time you asked the question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael L. Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">And then lastly, just I know I have asked this question before, is there a specific timeframe that you commit to, to achieve your ROA and ROE goals?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian T. Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Mike as I told you, Dan and me [ph] will be there with a few other people, and asked me questions on this question, we have the building blocks in place to get us to where we are and we consider building blocks are in a place to get us to our goals and there are external factors with the rate increase and stuff that are -- you see the market curve that\u2019s changed just in the last 15 days this quarter and has moved around dramatically. So we are going ahead with our control elements we continue to drive and see the progression towards next several quarters as we told you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce R. Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">And I think if I could -- just to be clear, we talked about a 100 basis points and 12% to 14% return on tangible common equity, obviously at 99 basis points we are bumping right up against that. And I think what\u2019s important is as you look to the past, to what we have talked we are basically there in the second quarter you can say you have the $700 million in FAS 91 the 400 of loan sale gains and a couple of hundred million from rep and warrant provision but what I think is interesting and as you look at the past Eric, if you look at and assume the 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve what that would mean in the quarter as well as if we ultimately get to where our LAS expense goals are you basically back to all other things being equal where we were this quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">So what was articulated is something where you couldn\u2019t see a path or a way to get there. I think it was a step forward this quarter as far as seeing how we can get there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael L. Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">All right thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">And we will take our final question from Christopher Wheeler from Atlantic Equities. Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christopher Wheeler</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Yes, good morning gentlemen and I am sorry to raise the subject of cost again. But I just want to square away what you said I think to Betsy\u2019s question at the very beginning. So what you said at the conference back in May when you actually said that if the trading revenues didn\u2019t pick up you would have to adjust costs further. I just wondered where you were on that, because obviously trading revenues were down about 2% year-on-year, I think in the quarter and I am having to assume that the start of the quarter has been pretty bumpy with Greece and China.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">So could you just talk a little bit about how you see that, perhaps also talk a little bit about how you might address that situation in global markets and global banking in respect of the U.S. business and the international businesses because it is very clear that the U.S. business seems to be offering more opportunities not just because they are more buoyant but also because you\u2019re seeing European bank play a lesser role than obviously seeing three of the big banks getting new CEOs in the last few weeks. I hardly imagine they are going to be allocating more capital to investment banking? Thank you. </p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce R. Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Let me take a stab at a couple of parts of that question. The first is and I think you referenced that what would you do if global market expenses were lower at a go-forward basis. I think this quarter was reflective of the way you\u2019d expect us to manage it which is the pure sales and trading number was down 2% and total expenses within the segment were down 5%. So I think some of what Brian communicated in May you saw evidence of that happening during the quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">The second thing that I would say is that it\u2019s obviously early in the quarter but I wouldn\u2019t draw any conclusions as to overall performance based on the volatility that we\u2019ve seen during the first couple of weeks to the negative. And then third, I think your question was and is just that with what\u2019s going on within some of the European banks as well as changes in management and questions around capital, how does that translate and what are you seeing in the U.S. business. I think I\u2019d say is that we obviously have significant share in the U.S. business. We\u2019re looking to do a better job of that and I think that as you look at some of the loan growth that we\u2019ve seen that it\u2019s reflective of the fact that we\u2019re deepening in the U.S. but just as importantly that loan growth is not only in the U.S. its\u2019 throughout Europe. There\u2019s been a little bit in Latin America and there\u2019s been growth in Asia Pac. </p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">So we are looking to use some of these market opportunities as a basis to deepen and look to grow the overall global banking segment. </p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christopher Wheeler</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Thanks very much, thank you. </p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Lee McEntire</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Thank you everyone. That\u2019s the last question and we look forward to talk to you next quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">This does conclude today\u2019s program.

Please note this call is being recorded. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. Lee McEntire. Please go ahead sir.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Lee McEntire</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning. Thanks to everybody on the phone, thanks on the webcast for joining us as well. Welcome to the third quarter results. Hopefully, everybody has had a chance to review the earnings release. It is only available on the Bank of America Investor Relations website.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">So before I turn over the call to Brian, let me just remind you we have a new CFO that will be going through the results this morning, Mr. Paul Donofrio. And so, we will -- we may make some forward-looking statements. For further information on those, please refer to either our earnings release documents on our website or our SEC filings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">So with that I will turn it over to Brian.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Brian T. Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you Lee, and good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our third quarter results. Today, we reported $4.5 billion in after tax earnings or $0.37 per diluted share. When we think about the quarter, the key message is we continued to make good progress in a tough revenue environment due to low interest rates and a sluggish economic recovery. In addition with the late summer's volatility, especially the fixed income trading markets are remaining challenging. So with that we produced another good quarter of progress in all the businesses. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Before Paul takes you through the details of the quarter, I want to provide a little context from my vantage point. We continued to make progress towards our full earnings capacity here at Bank of America, and this quarter represents the fourth consecutive quarter of solid results following the resolution of our large legacy exposures in the third quarter of last year. When you think about it, over the last four quarters we have reported over $16 billion in after-tax income. That compares to the previous four quarters leading us to the third quarter of 2014 of about 5.2 billion, including the significant litigation cost. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Returns over the last four quarters in aggregate generated an ROA of about 76 basis points and a 10% return on tangible common equity. This quarter, we were able to keep the absolute level of our balance sheet flat to the second quarter. But by doing that, we continued to replace discretionary assets with good core customer loans, and we believe that is a very good trend. We continue to build record liquidity, and we believe we are well positioned against 2017 LCR requirements. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Our capital is again at record levels, and we returned over $3 billion back to shareholders so far this year through common share repurchases and dividends. Our tangible book value per share improved this quarter to $15.50. It is the highest level in many, many years. So, I am going to spend a couple more minutes focusing on a few drivers in our business. Our teams here at Bank of America are focused on the everyday engagement with our customers, deepening relationships by growing the core things we do with them, deposits, loans, managing their risks, helping them invest their assets, all while keeping our cost down, and you can see that in our results. When you think about our deposit franchise, we grew $50 billion in deposits over the last year, on an all-organic basis. That in and of itself is a large bank.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">As a reminder, our consumer franchise is the largest retail bank in the United States. In our consumer banking business, as you can see, we grew revenue and earnings year-over-year despite the low interest rate environment. We have been restructuring our branch structure, selling some branches, closing some branches, and changing account structures, and with that this quarter our core consumer checking accounts continued to grow. We grew those accounts and improved the percentage of those customers who use us as a primary bank, and importantly the average balance per account continues to grow. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">On cards, on credit cards, we issued another 1.3 million credit cards this quarter, and active accounts continued to grow. The good news is we are doing it through the lowest cost possible through our core franchise much lower than other means of growth. When you go to the change in our financial services business for mobile and digital banking, we now have 18.4 million active mobile customers and 31 million active online customers. Digital sales this quarter were up 30% over the last year. More customers are using mobile device to deposit checks and access their accounts, and now are starting to buy products as well as book appointments. To get a sense of that, we are now booking 15,000 appointments a week off of our mobile devices. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Our Merrill Lynch teammates who work within our consumer business helped push us through a new standard of 2 million accounts this quarter. When we go to our wealth management business, this business is showing the effects of lower market valuations pressuring revenue, but actively here has reflected good long term flows, good deposit flows, and good loan growth. In addition, we continued to invest in long-term growth in this business. More advisors, better products, and better advice in building and preserving wealth for our clients, and these clients continue to use the full range of our products including banking products. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">As we switch to our commercial banking business, the business we call global banking, loans to commercial and corporate clients around the globe grew nicely from last quarter and the year-ago quarter. And although investment banking fees were down year-over-year, the industry fee pools appeared to be down as much or more. We maintained our leadership across many of the products. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In our global markets business, despite the challenging market conditions in the late August and September timeframe, we reported $1 billion in after-tax earnings in that business. Excluding DDA impacts, this is the best third quarter in earnings for this business we have seen in recent memory. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Our net interest income in the company is benefiting from loan and deposit growth showing momentum this quarter after you exclude the impact of FAS 91. Focusing on expenses, which we have talked to you much about, we continue to hold our costs in check. Expense less litigation LAS costs remain well below the $13 billion threshold at $12.7 billion, and that was in line with our second quarter despite the additional costs of CCAR and additional investments in the business. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We are taking the benefits of our simplify and improve program, which keeps our costs flat, while we continue to invest in customer-facing client people to grow our businesses. This ability to invest in growth is key to driving our franchise forward. When you go to the risk side of the house, credit risk remains very strong, market risk remains subdued, and we get a great return on that VAR as you look at it across the competitors. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We continue to feel good about our legacy exposure risk, and LAS business continues to work itself down. So, in the context of the environment we faced, we are operating what we feel is a solid quarter, and as evidenced, the continuing progress on our strategy, our strategy of responsible growth with our customs. With that let me hand it over to Paul. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"><strong>Paul Donofrio</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Thanks Brian, good morning everybody. Starting on slide 3, we present the summary of our income statement and returns for this quarter as well as Q2 and Q3 last year. As Brian said, we earned $4.5 billion in the quarter compared to a loss of a couple hundred million dollars last year and earnings of $5.3 billion in Q2. Earnings per share this quarter were $0.37. Let me mention a few larger items that in aggregate benefited diluted EPS this quarter by a penny. First, a negative $597 million market related NII adjustments, primarily FAS 91, cost us about $0.03. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">More than offsetting this was a $0.02 benefit from DVA of $313 million and a $0.02 benefit from a collective impact of three other items; gains from selling some consumer real estate loans, tax benefits from restructuring some of the non-U.S. subsidiaries, and a provision for payment protection insurance in the UK. Revenues were 20.9 billion this quarter, expenses were 13.8 billion, significantly lower than a year ago because of litigation costs and compared to Q2, expenses were flat as we managed costs well, while investing in our franchise. Return on assets was 82 basis points this quarter and return on tangible common equity was 10%. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to slide 4, the balance sheet ended basically flat relative to Q2 with assets of 2.15 trillion. However, we grew deposits 12 billion from Q2 while long-term debt declined by approximately 6 billion. Liquidity rose to nearly $500 billion, a record level and the time required for funding is now three and half years. Tangible common equity of 162 billion improved because of earnings supplemented by 1.5 billion in OTI. This was partially offset by 1.3 billion in capital return to common shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Tangible book value increased 10% from Q3 last year, and our tangible common equity ratio grew to 7.8% as equity improvements outpaced asset growth. With regard to regulatory capital I want to start by pointing out that our transition ratios under Basel III increased with CET1 ending the quarter at 11.6%. However, I will focus my comments on Basel III fully phased in regulatory capital ratios. CET1 capital improved 4.8 billion to 153 billion driven by net income, positive OTI, and DTA utilization. This was partially offset by capital returned to shareholders. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Under the standardized approach, our CET1 ratio improved to 10.8% as risk-weighted assets decreased modestly even as loans grew. Under the standardized approaches, the CET1 ratio increased from 10.4% to 11% as RWA improved by roughly 30 billion, largely due to reductions in risk. During the quarter, we announced that we exited parallel loans, and we will begin reporting under the advanced approaches beginning in 4Q. So, we have also presented our CET1 ratio for 9/30 on a pro forma basis, which includes the addition of approximately 170 billion in RWA primarily for wholesale credit under the advanced approaches. The pro forma CET1 ratio at 9/30 was 9.7%, an increase of approximately 40 basis points from Q2 on the same pro forma basis. In terms of the supplementary leverage ratio, we estimate that as of 9/30 we continue to exceed U.S. rules applicable at the beginning of 2018 at both bank and parent. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to slide 5, we grew loans and deposits both of which are key drivers to our financial performance. We reported loans on an end of period basis increased 1.2 billion from Q2. However, underneath the consolidated number there was significant activity I want to take a moment to point out. With that in mind, let\u2019s review why loans in all other and LAS are declining. First, the portion of our mortgages that we report in all other continue to run off due to pay downs. This run off is being replaced by new loans which are now reported in business segments like GWIM and consumer where they are originated. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Second, also in all other, we converted 6.2 billion of mortgages with long-term standby agreements into securities thereby improving HQLA. These types of conversions are largely complete. Third, we sold roughly 3.6 billion of other mortgages and NPLs as we continue to clean up and optimize the balance sheet. Lastly, in LAS, where we report our legacy home equity portfolio, second lien loans continue to run off. Now, if one excludes the above activities in LAS and all other, ending loans in our primary lending segments increased $19 billion or 3% from Q2. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to deposits, on an ending basis, they reached 1.16 trillion this quarter, growing 50 billion or 4% over Q3 last year. We produced solid growth across the franchise. Global banking grew deposits 6% year-over-year. GWIM grew 3%, and consumer grew 7%. However, as you can see at the bottom right , if one includes CD run off, consumer deposits grew 10%. We have also included two other tables to give you a sense of the composition of our deposits. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to quality on slide 6, I won't spend a lot of time here as asset quality continued to be strong and mostly consistent with Q2. Net charge offs were flat around 930 million versus adjusted Q2, Q3 provision expense of 806 million, and we released a net 126 million in reserves. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Releases in consumer real estate and credit cards were partially offset by reserve builds in commercial. In commercial, we saw small increases in reserve over criticized exposure from Q2 driven by a downgrades in oil and gas that were partially offset by some improvements in the rest of the commercial portfolio. Also noteworthy, the increase in oil and gas reserve over criticized in Q3 was less than half the size of the increase from Q1 to Q2. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to slide 7, net interest income on a reported FTE basis was 9.7 billion, declining 1 billion from Q2. The decline in long end rates in the quarter caused adjustments in our bond premium amortization, which resulted in a linked quarter decline in NII of 1.3 billion partially offset by good growth in NII otherwise. The Q2 adjustment increased NII by 669 million while the Q3 adjustment decreased NII by 597 million. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">NII excluding these adjustments improved 292 million from Q2, to 10.3 billion. Three factors drove this increase. First, we grew core commercial loans. Second, we improved the composition of the balance sheet and our global markets business which improved trading related NII. And third, we benefited from one extra day in the quarter. With regard to asset sensitivity, at the end of the third quarter our overall asset sensitivity increased as a result of the decline in long end rates, which drove the FAS 91 adjustment. As of 9/30, an instantaneous 100 basis point parallel increase in rates is estimated to increase NII by approximately 4.5 billion over the subsequent year with a little more than half of that improvement caused by increases in short end rates. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to slide 8, non-interest expense was 13.8 billion in Q3, matching the level of expense reported in Q2. The 20.1 billion expense in Q3 last year included 6 billion in litigation costs. Litigation this quarter and in Q2 was less than 250 million. Excluding litigation, expenses were 13.6 billion in the quarter, a decline of 600 million or 4% from last year and consistent with Q2 despite additional costs related to our CCAR submission.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Headcount continues to trend lower, down 6% compared to Q3 last year. LAS costs, excluding litigation, were relatively stable compared to Q2. However, we still expect to lower that number to roughly 800 million in Q4 and move lower in 2016. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter, we tend to experience some seasonal increase in expenses as we close out the year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Let\u2019s walk through the business segments starting on slide 9 with consumer banking. Consumer earned 1.8 billion, 5% greater than Q3 last year. The business segment generated strong 24% return on allocated capital. Revenue increased over last year as increases in non-interest income outpaced the decline in NII. With respect to NII compared to last year, the benefit of higher deposit levels was more than offset by the allocation of ALM activity and lower card yields [ph]. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Non-interest income benefited from divestiture gains as well as higher card income driven by increased customer activity while service charges declined. Expenses declined from Q3 last year despite a 5% increase in sales specialist and higher fraud costs in advance of ruling changes regarding EMV chip implementation. Those increases were offset by savings from the continued optimization of our delivery network. The cost of operating our deposit franchise remains low at 180 basis points, and the consumer bank reported an efficiency ratio of 57%. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We continue to experience shifts in consumer activity away from branches towards self-service options. Self-service trends are driven by mobile banking, online banking, and ATM usage. Mobile banking customers increased to 18.4 million and deposits via mobile devices now represent 14% of consumer deposit transactions. Mobile processing is better for us and it is better for our customers. It is one-tenth the cost relative to processing of financial centers and more convenient for customers. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On slide 10, we present key drivers and trends. Average loans grew across mortgages, card, and vehicle lending. Deposits, as Brian mentioned, continued to increase particularly if one excludes the impact of CD declining. On this basis, deposits were up 10% from the year ago. Regarding brokerage assets, Merrill Lynch accounts crossed the 2 million mark and are up 2%, while asset levels are up 8% from last year even with declines in equity markets this year. Mortgage production, although up from 3Q last year, was down from 2Q as refinances declined. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">In the future, mortgage banking income in the consumer segment will be lower by approximately $30 million per quarter given the Q3 sale of a small appraisal business. A similar amount of expense should reduce quarterly as well. Looking at our card activity, card issuance was strong at 1.3 million. Combined credit and debit spending volumes were up 3% from last year despite the decline in fuel prices. Average outstandings were down slightly from Q3 last year as customers paid off more of their balances. However, average balances showed modest growth over Q2. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">U.S. card credit volume was strong as net charge offs declined this quarter to a decade low of 2.5% driving risk-adjusted margins higher to 9.3% excluding divestitures. Turning to service charges, they were down moderately versus Q2 last year -- Q3 last year as we continued to open higher quality accounts that carry higher balances. These higher quality accounts tend to have fewer account fees. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Turning to slide 11, global wealth and investment management produced earnings of $656 million. Results were down from Q3 last year driven by lower market values and lower [indiscernible] client activity. Compared to Q3 last year, asset management fees were up 2% but more than offset by declines in transactional revenues. The trend of lower transactional revenues continued this quarter as clients migrated from brokerage to managed relationships which was compounded by lower markets and muted new issuance. On NII, the benefits of higher loan and deposit flows was more than offset by the company's ALM activities driving NII down from Q3 last year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Non-interest expense was modestly higher than the year ago period as litigation costs were higher and wealth advisors grew 6%. Pre-tax margin was 23%, down from a strong Q3 last year. Margins were pressured this quarter by a few factors. First, markets declined pressuring revenue across many products especially those in which we record transactional revenues. Second, operating leverage was challenged as areas of revenue where incentives are high like asset management grew while NII where incentives are much lower declined. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Moving to slide 12, despite the lower market levels, business drivers improved. Wealth advisors were up almost 1000 or 6% from Q3 last year. Long-term AUM flows were more than 4 billion, deposits increased more than 7 million, average loans were up 10% from last year, our 22nd consecutive quarter of loan growth in this segment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">The last thing I would note that\u2019s not shown here is referral rates across the company remained strong. For example, our retirement solutions business continues to win in the marketplace. We have won more than 1200 retirement plans year-to-date, many of which were referred from global banking. On a year-to-date basis, this is up more than 40% from 2014. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Turning to slide 13, global banking\u2019s earnings were 1.3 billion, generating a 14% return on allocated capital. Earnings declined from Q3 last year but were up modestly versus Q2. The comparison to Q3 last year reflects higher provision expense and lower NII driven by the company\u2019s ALM activities as well as increased liquidity costs. Additionally, we saw year-over-year compression in loans spread; however, loan growth was a positive contributor to NII. Growth from Q2 reflects improved NII from loan and deposit growth. Regarding provision expense while flat to Q2, it is up 243 million from last year. We added 125 million to reserves in Q3 compared to a release of 116 million in the year ago quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Looking at trends on slide 14, let\u2019s first focus on fees relative to the same period last year given seasonality. Despite a lower level of IBCs this quarter, we maintained our number three global fee position and believe we increased our market share as industry fees pools declined. Investment banking fees for the company this quarter were 1.3 billion, down 5% from Q3 last year. Advisory fees were up 24%. Debt underwriting was down modestly, equity underwriting was down from Q3 last year, in line with industry volume declines.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Outside of IB, our treasury fees improved from Q2 on increased activity. Looking at the balance sheet, loans on average were $310 billion up 9% year-over-year and a similar percent relative to Q2 on an annualized basis. The growth was broad across both corporate and commercial borrowers and asset quality was consistent with our overall portfolio. Importantly, the decline in spreads year-over-year flattened as the decline from Q2 was relatively small.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On deposits we saw good performance with average deposits increasing by $8 billion over Q2 and we continued to optimize the portfolio improving the composition towards higher quality deposits from an overall LCR perspective.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Switching to global markets on slide 15, earnings were $1 billion on revenue of $4.1 billion despite challenging markets. We generated 11% return this quarter. Earnings were up from Q3 last year which included litigation cost of roughly $600 million most of which was non-deductible for tax purposes. As you can see, we had a net DVA gain this quarter which was higher than last year. Total revenues excluding net DVA declined from Q3 last year driven by lower fixed sales and trading and to a lesser extent IBCs, offset partially by improved equity sales and trading. Non-interest expense excluding litigation improved a $102 million versus Q3 last year, up 4% improvement.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Moving to trends on slide 16 and focusing on the components of our sales and trading performance. Sales and trading revenue of $3.2 billion excluding net DVA is down 4% from Q3 last year. Comparing to the same period a year ago, fixed sales and trading revenue declined 11%. Similar to the first half of this year the year-over-year comparisons reflect good activity and macro related products like rates and after tax. Conversely, market activity remained muted in credit products driving lower client activity this quarter than Q3 last year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">As a reminder, our mix remains more heavily weighted towards credit products driven by the strength of our new issues capability and market share. Equity rose 12% driven by strong performance in equity derivatives reflecting favorable market conditions. Asset levels were down modestly from Q3 last year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Turning to legacy asset servicing on slide 17, this segment lost roughly $200 million. I want to focus on three things here; the reduction in delinquent loans, mortgage banking income, and expenses and compare each to Q2. First, the number of delinquency for mortgage loans continued to decline down 14% this quarter as the teams continued to work through solutions for customers. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Second, mortgage banking income declined by more than $400 million. This decline was driven primarily by three factors, servicing fees declined about $50 million as the units we serviced declined. Net MSR and hedge performance declined a $100 million driven by gains on MSR sales in Q2. Reps and warranty provisions swung nearly $300 million from a benefit of $204 million in Q2 to a provision of $77 million this quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Lastly, I want to focus on expenses which excluding litigation were flat compared to Q2 as increased professional fees offset improved operating cost from the decline in delinquent loans. We believe we were on-track to achieve our goal of reducing expenses excluding litigation to approximately $800 million in Q4. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">On slide 18, we show all other which primarily includes our ALM actions and the operations of our UK card business and other smaller activities. While other reported a $503 million pretax loss, more than offset by certain tax benefits. The pretax loss was a result of a negative NII market related adjustments and an increase in provisioning for UK credit card payment protection insurance. This was partially offset by gains from securities and loan sales. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Regarding the change in PPI liability, we increased it because of a notice of future regulatory guidance regarding treatments of claims and a case ruling.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"> A comment or two on taxes before we wrap up. The Company's effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%. It was lower than Q2 due to the tax benefits I mentioned earlier. I will expect the tax rate to be roughly 30% next quarter excluding unusual items and specifically the UK, the recent UK tax proposals. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">In terms of 2016, I would expect it to be in the low 30s. As a reminder from last quarter's announcement we expect that the UK tax proposal announced in July will result in a one-time tax charge of approximately $300 million upon enactment from revaluing our UK DTAs. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Let me conclude our prepared comments by offering these takeaways. Although the U.S. economy is improving slowly, revenue growth remains challenging in this interest rate environment. We are focused on those things we can control and drive, these includes delivering for our clients and customers within our risk framework and driving those things we know will result in sustainable profits and returns.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Our results reflect this focus. We grew both loans and deposits across our business. We delivered to our corporate institutional clients in a challenging market environment. We stayed focused on managing risk and we kept cost in check while investing in the business. We are getting better positioned each quarter for the current business environment and we remain well positioned to benefit when rates rise. With that let's open it up to Q&amp;A.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p7\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">[Operator Instructions]. And we can take our first question from Eric Wasserstrom from Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Thanks, good morning. I was just wondering if you can maybe just speak a little bit about the NII outlook given the dynamics about the stable balance sheet, shifts within the balance sheet, and how we should think about both the GAAP and adjusted NIM if the interest rate environment continues to look more or less like it does today. Can you just kind of help us think through what all those dynamics mean for NII?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Sure so I am assuming some loan growth and adjusting for day count we would expect normalized NII excluding marketable adjustments to be flat to grind up and as long as rates don\u2019t decline in the future. In the fourth quarter, we think they\u2019ll wind up slightly based upon the realization of the expected forward curve and some loan growth. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay and with respect to the loan growth, is that in the context of growth in the overall balance sheet or continued stability given mix shift?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian T. Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I think we just look at commercial loans year-over-year at 10%, last quarter up 3% so you got to annualize that out and what we\u2019re looking at is that we replaced discretionary assets with actually good core assets. So whether the balance sheet grows a little bit or not is not as critical as the assets . So it is probably driven in near-term more by mix than aggregate size growth on a GAAP basis . </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay, thanks very much. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And we\u2019ll take the next question from John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hi, wondering on expenses, you kept the core expenses flat to last quarter. Did you digest additional CCAR expenses and also some cost related to the proxy vote? What are the puts and takes in keeping that flat and what\u2019s your outlook on the core expenses going from here in this kind of environment?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian T. Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Sure, so the short answer to your question but then I\u2019d like to elaborate a little bit more is yes we kept core expenses flat and we absorbed CCAR expenses and other investments in the business in the quarter. Just take a step back I think the way we would ask you to think about expenses is we are seeing good expense progress within our business importantly as we continue to invest in the future. So core expenses which everybody excludes litigation LAS are expected to remain relatively flat at probably a little less than 13 billion per quarter in a moderately improving business environment. As we invest in growth and [indiscernible] other initiatives to offset inflationary pressures. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">If the business environment is close, we would have to adjust. If the business environment is better we are going to use SIM and other efforts to improve the operating leverage of this company even as incentives and other expenses increase. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">One more point Brian, I would remind everybody that we did guide you that we would have increasing cost expenses in the second half of the year so we do have a little bit of that in the fourth quarter as well. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian T. Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So John just when you think about it from a headcount perspective because that\u2019s what going to drive our 60% people cost now. For the quarter we are down by 1.5, in that we actually had an increase in client facing headcount for the quarter of 1.6. So basically we are able to achieve a reduction while we continue to invest. On top of that the risk in CCAR FTE count was up about 400 for the quarter and other business hiring especially the new kids from school were up about a thousand. So to attrition and then through other reductions we got that down in that 1.5. So if you follow that course last quarter we were down 3,000 or so and that was just 15 quarters in a row or something like that. We are down a little less this quarter which is expected to be similar pickup next quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So the 12.7 we did in the second quarter remember was a surprise to all of you. We called it flat this quarter which I think exceeds what our expectations were. We are laser focused on keeping it to that kind of level where we continue to invest in the thousand plus people to go generate the business growth you are starting to see.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay and Paul in terms of their credit outlook do you expect to kind of bounce around here, you got charge offs in the low 900s and you did about 100 million reserve release so charge off is 900, provision is 800, is that the kind of ballpark you expect to stay in near term?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I would expect to see provision in 2016 roughly you know where it is today. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So that\u2019s around 800 a quarter, something like that ballpark?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian T. Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yes, because we are going to get a little help. John, if you look at it, you still got a little excess mortgage charge offs going through. Card continues to work its way down because of this period of credit quality and the question on the commercial side is bouncing around, gets lumpy. But if you look at the reserve release we are down to 100 so think of that sort of 800 to 900 range a quarter and I think that is a way to think about it over the next several quarters. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay, thank you. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">[Operator Instructions]. We take our next questions from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Hi, good morning. Paul I just wanted to ask you to elaborate a little bit on the comment that you made during prepared remarks regarding the composition of the balance sheet improving and that being a benefit for trading related NII, could you just talk through what you did and is that sustainable, the benefits to NII?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian T. Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Sure, I think the answer is we just sold, for lack of better word, sold some lower yielding assets that we used to run our business and markets and we positioned them to high yielding assets. So maybe we led a little bit of as an example, we would do a little bit less in prime brokerage and a little bit more in fixed income where some -- yields are higher. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay, and then on the conversion of loans to securities for HQLA , given the fact that you mentioned that is done, what kind of core loan growth are we looking for as we move forward here?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Well by core do you mean loan growth in the business segments or for the consolidated company.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Well, I guess I will take the consolidated more than anything. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yes, so we grew in loans as a consolidated company year-over-year by 1%. It was up slightly quarter-over-quarter. I wish that we would be able to continue to grow the whole company in the sort of -- in that range. You can see faster growth in the core lending businesses. We grew that year-over-year at 9%. I am not going to stand here and tell you that we are going to do that every quarter, but we would expect to see more robust growth in our lending segments. You have to remember that in LAS, home-equity loans are still coming down and in the discretionary portfolio even though we are not going to have $6 billion -- as much as $6 billion LTSE conversions we still are going to see first mortgages run off there. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And just then lastly on this topic when you are thinking about reinvesting deposit growth, etc. in securities, where are you relative to your new investments in securities versus what the portfolio yields are, are you close to breakeven there or\u2026?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian T. Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">In terms of the running off yields, Betsy, versus the coming on yield?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Correct. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian T. Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">It is relatively stable. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian T. Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"> Our portfolio has been priced down over the years and so it is relatively stable. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. Thanks. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And our next question will be from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Good morning. Can you give us an update on the CCAR resubmission and then also comment on some of the management changes that occurred there as you think about the 2016 process, just how you might approach it differently or similar to what you have done in the past?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Why don\u2019t I start with CCAR and then maybe Brian will speak to some management. So in terms of CCAR we submitted our resubmission on September 30 as planned. That had the involvement of the leadership of the company and the Board, significant involvement for the line of business. We tried to keep the regulators involved and up to speed every step of the way and they have until 75 days after that submission to get back to us. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian T. Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes, in terms of the change, three months ago we told you that we are making the changes. Nothing has changed and Terry continues to work on the CCAR process, Terry Laughlin and Andrea has moved over as Chief Administrative Officer and been heading the process from the day that we announced it. And that transition will continue to take place over the period of time between now and the next CCAR submission in 2016.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay, and then just separately in terms of the credit quality comments that you provided for the next several quarters, how are you thinking about energy as part of that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I think we mentioned in the prepared remarks that our criticized assets were up modestly. If you sort of dive into the oil and gas segment, you will remember last quarter we increased in criticized assets about $1 billion because of oil and gas.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">This quarter we saw that increase decline significantly to about 40% of that level and then be offset by improvements in the rest of the portfolio. So we saw a modest increase in criticized assets. We feel pretty good right now where we are with oil and gas. As you know our clients are going through the redetermination process. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Just a big picture question following up on that, there was a lot of concern I think among credit folks that energy default is have increased a lot and will continue to increase from here but we are not really seeing all that much pressure with either you guys or the banks. Is it -- are you guys higher in the structure, different customer base, why do you think there is kind of less pressure with you guys than we are seeing for the industry as a whole outside of banks?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian T. Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I think the answer is yes. The hiring structure and from lot of the risk is distributed out to investors and things like that. The Company has had reserve base methodologies our hedge involved and it is more complex, I think than oil price changes. So I think as you look at it our lending portfolio is done consistent with our quality standards and had held pretty well under the significant change in oil revenue from oil price changes. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And large corporates, we are just dealing with larger companies that have a lot of different options and in middle market, as Brian said a lot of that lending secure . </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">If you look at our overall energy portfolio we are about 22ish and really only about 40% of that really isn\u2019t tied. Of course everything in that sector is tied in some way to oil and gas but 40% of that\u2019s not really directly tied to the price of oil and gas. So when you start just walking through the numbers and you whittle that down and then you whittle it down for the number of loans that we have where we have reserves, it gets to something I think that is manageable.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay, thank you very much. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And the next question will come from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Hey, good morning Paul just a quick question on the liability side of the balance sheet. You had highlighted that the long term debt was down $6 billion or so in the quarter. I know that long term debt cost were down about 11 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Is that sustainable in the context of TLAC, as there is just some movement underneath the hood or is it timing, just kind of help me think about where that footprint and cost go from here?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Sure, but we generally don\u2019t comment on our issuance plans. I guess the only guidance I would give you is we are going to try to have prefer that\u2019s roughly 1.5% of tier 1 capital and sub debt that\u2019s roughly 2%. And in terms of TLAC we don\u2019t know what the rules are yet. We may have to issue a little bit more debt, but based upon what we are hearing at least from the rumor perspective it looks to be quite manageable. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian T. Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Technically, quarter-to-quarter there were some hedges that went from a deduct to a benefit -- that is the other way around the change that rate. So, I wouldn\u2019t think that the rates, the underlying rates haven\u2019t changed much is the way to think about it. There is just a hedge cost and a hedge benefit that came through that increased the spread. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Or, you were referring to the decline in the yield, sorry. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">That\u2019s all helpful and maybe just on the loan growth side what are you seeing on the demand side, consumer has begun to pickup for you guys where are you seeing the most strength and do you think the environment still is pretty positive from a loan demand perspective in the U.S.?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian T. Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Remember we are focused on in the consumer business on two things that we have been consistently focused on. We are making loans to our customers i.e., in connection with the whole franchise. And then secondly, we are staying in the very prime orientation so if you think about this quarter, home-equity production was $3 billionish which was kind of consistent with other quarters that have grown from $1 billion up to $3 billion across the last couple of years and have been very consistent. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">As Paul said earlier mortgage has tipped down a little bit, but year-over-year they are up strong. Little bit seasonality and there is a little bit of refi going out. Our other lending business was still was strong. The direct to consumer piece of that we didn\u2019t have two three years ago. We are at half billion dollar a quarter production, so we are seeing good demand. But part of it is just capturing that inherent client share, wallet share that we have been after and you\u2019re seeing that materialize. The other key honestly in terms of nominal growth for us is the one off non-core part that has gotten small enough over the last couple of years that we\u2019ve overcome it. So the only place we still have that hold from a quarter perspective is really the home equity business. So, we resized the card business and you are seeing all the hardwork the 1.3 million cards producing some loans even though it is a huge payment rate on that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">You are seeing the auto lending business close direct to consumer and then what we do with dealers and stuff. They are strong and stable and you saw the car sales numbers strong and you are seeing the consumer real estate strong from the home equity production is solid. So, when you go over to GWIN, you saw loan growth there between U.S. trust and what we call structure lending but don\u2019t think of it that way. It is lending strategy, assets, wealth assets again also in the margin lending with more stable, it was very stable. I thought [indiscernible] we haven\u2019t seen him change in our margin lending. Lot of people think, investors that lower the risk is basically been relatively stable across the last few months. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay, great. That is helpful. Thanks. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian T. Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Hello Steven. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Hello Steven, your line is open please shut the mute button. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Sorry, can you hear me now. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian T. Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">My apologies for that. So, one of your competitors revealed that their efforts to mitigate some of the GSIF indicators had actually helped push them into a lower GSIF bucket and looking at the metrics that have been published as of year-end it looks like you are actually closer to the lower end of that 3% threshold and we have seen some progress in terms of reduction of level 3 assets at your end, I just wanted to see if you actually see opportunities to manage that bucket lower or somewhere closer to 2.5%?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian T. Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">We always manage the balance sheet against all the different constraints and you can see the improvement in the pro forma advanced ratio by 40 basis points this quarter closing down the gap. So, we are always looking to manage the balance sheet; I wouldn\u2019t put a lot of stake in us moving ourselves fundamentally in buckets at this point because we have been working at that the last three years to make sure that this rule came out that we have had ourselves positioned as well as we could. So we will continue to work on it but I wouldn\u2019t expect us to change. If you look about risk assets and level 3 assets and things like that and our company continued to trend down. We just worked the balance sheet. I wouldn\u2019t say that we expect to move our bucket. We could but we don\u2019t expect to. </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay, that is really helpful. Thanks Brian. And maybe just thinking into some of the GWIM guidance that Paul you had given earlier, the negative operating leverage has been fairly pronounced which you acknowledged and I did appreciate the detail based on some of the specific factors that weigh on the margin such as litigation and maybe some remixing in terms of revenue. But just wanted to get a sense as to how we should be thinking about that margin trajectory going forward assuming no elevated litigation and without any rate boost, just to get a sense as to how we should be thinking about that profitability trajectory?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian T. Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Let me -- if you remember last quarter we talked a bit about this. There are some things that will help us which are that some of the deal stuff runs off this year relative to next year which would give us some positive help, round numbers nearly $100 million a quarter of expense. So, that\u2019s just amortization that finally runs off, so that is positive, and I think Paul cited it and you cited back examples of some non-recurring things. I think you have to be careful in the year-over-year comparisons on the margin because this business [indiscernible] big bank it\u2019s harder to do one business at 250 to $1 billion deposit franchise, big money franchise. So all dynamics that we talked about from the corporate obviously hit them also. And so they will benefit more by stability in that as we compare quarters and then hopefully they\u2019ll grow out of that as they grow loans and deposits, that\u2019s the thing. </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">The question then comes down to more philosophically, would you quit investing in new advisors to get a point on margin or so and in the context that business were in $600 million or $700 million after tax for us in the context needing to drive it to another level. We still believe the right trait is to continue to invest in growth and the world changed and people weren\u2019t becoming successful which they are, we could change that. And the thought is that we are adding advisors, you don\u2019t see that in other people\u2019s franchises and we are doing in connection with consumer bank which is a critical increased success factor for our advisors. In other words if we hire people in what they call BFAs that worked within a consumer franchise with our Merrill teams and we are seeing them get up to speed fast. We think that\u2019s a competitive advantage for people entering this business and we will continue to invest in that. So, if we can't see the successful pull back on that right now it is worth it for our shareholders and our customers. </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay, thanks for that detail Brian, and maybe just one more from me on the investment banking side. One of your competitors was talking about a pause in activity that they have experienced so far in 4Q. I recognize it is early days but just wanted to get a sense as to what you are seeing within the global banking and markets businesses and also if you can provide just some additional color or detail on what you are seeing in the backlogs by channel that would be really helpful too. </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian T. Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I\u2019ll let Paul hit that but in terms of the \u2013 but just want to make sure you are talking about trading or investment banking fees or both?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Both?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian T. Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay, Paul. </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">SO I guess in terms of the pipeline, the pipeline right now looks quite \u2013 if this is investment banking fees, pipeline right now looks quite strong. There is a decent amount of M&amp;A in it, the timing of which can move around a lot. Some of the pipeline increase I guess can be attributed to transaction that were in our pipeline in the third quarter, didn\u2019t come out in the third quarter and we are now into the fourth quarter. We saw that type of activity in ECM and as markets improve we hope that pipeline activity will come out. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">In terms of sales and trading we talked a little bit about that in the prepared remarks. We saw I think great activity in equity sales and trading as clients needed to rebalance risk or take advantage of opportunities. But if we are in Asia we were getting some of that [flow] [ph] and feel good about it. On the other hand we do have a strong FICC business that\u2019s tied into issuance and the new issuance market in the third quarter wasn\u2019t as strong so some of the flows just weren\u2019t there. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian T. Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Year over year - last year\u2019s fourth quarter was pretty tough so I think [being better than that] [ph] wouldn\u2019t be great performance in sales and trading, but Tom and the team have got business pretty well positioned in terms of effectiveness. And that\u2019s why even with the slowdown in the latter part of the quarter we still made a billion bucks and you subtract out DVAs 800 million or so, and that\u2019s good performance numbers. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Alright great, that\u2019s it from me. Thank you for taking my questions. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And we\u2019ll go next to Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Hi thanks, a couple of quick follow ups. Heard all your comments so no need to repeat on the feeling decent about credit quality and energy specifically. Just looking for two pieces of info if you are willing to share either a reserve as a percentage of loans for energy specifically or it may be what percentage of the criticized exposure is energy related, just get looking for more detail behind the comfort, thanks?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I don\u2019t think we have any of that perspective with us handy and not sure we can disclose that but we\u2019ll follow up with you if we do. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay, worth trying. In terms of what\u2019s going on in terms of the mix shift on balance sheet, added some of the discretionary assets and into the core loan growth, I think everybody will take that all day long. I am curious on if there are RWA implications that we need to think about, is that a heavier RWA mix even though we\u2019ll take it I am just curious on how that plays on the capital side?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yes, I think that as we grow loans obviously our RWA is going to increase particularly on a standardized basis less of an increase on an advanced basis. But they are completely tied and as you said we are comfortable with that given the interaction with our clients and the opportunities that brings to increase our margins relative to other investment opportunities. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian T. Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I think as you think about it remember that if we go look at page 5 and you look at the content of what\u2019s leading coming on especially in the consumer business and then think about running that through all kinds of models including the CCAR process and think about getting rid of $5 billion of home equity loans which are basically non performing and putting on $3 billion of good home equity loans, that dynamic is pretty favorable to the overall sort of calculation and so. It\u2019s not only within category -- it is not only category, it\u2019s also within category that we are seeing improvement in credit quality on what\u2019s coming on but especially when you run through models and things like that. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay, I appreciate that. One last one on you commented earlier about the strength in equities, partially driven by the good performance in the derivatives business during the quarter. I guess the question is it ebbs and flows but maybe over the last 12 months not just the last quarter, is derivatives 40%, 50% of overall equities, is that a number you want to share. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Are you talking about the percentage of equities as a function of what?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I am saying in any given period your equity markets revenues how much of that is driven via the derivatives business?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian T. Moynihano</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I don\u2019t have a number on top of my head but I think you can look at it in various pieces; we\u2019re checking it out but you can remember that it is an integrated business. It is between 30% and 40%, we just found a number, but remember it\u2019s an integrated business so you can't say grow derivatives but the cash \u2013 because the clients do all things whether it's including fixed income and equity, so we are going together, so think 30% to 40%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Understood, alright, thank you. </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And our next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jeffries. Please go ahead. </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ken Usdin</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Hi, good morning. Brian just one question follow up on the loan side. You talked about the demand and where you\u2019re seeing it but I am just wondering in terms of like the no excuses growth mentality from a supply side, where are the lending officers now in terms of like using the excess capacity to continue to grow the balance sheet, is there still room from the BofA supply side to extend that growth on top of what the economy and the marketplace is giving you broadly?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian T. Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yes, I think, so if you look at the different segments, if you think about on the consumer side using \u2013 it\u2019s more sales force growth and effectiveness in building that team. And then also the digital sales coming up whether it is auto, whether its credit cards are up dramatically. So think of that engine as being both people and a machine for lack of better term. But don\u2019t think of it as changing credit quality or taking any kind of more risk, so Tom and Dean that run that business for us has done a good job and so I\u2019d say the supply has been more from a delivery capacity than it is from an expanding the box or anything like that. We really kept it to where we want it and we think that holds us in good stead as you think through all the different dynamics on company. </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">When you go to the commercial side it is simply couple of things and a very small business which is reported in consumer we have actually seen that business stabilize and start to make its way out of runoff position and that\u2019s again more automated scored approach, we sped up approval times and done a lot of work to make ourselves more competitive, more on delivery than credit. But if you go on business banking, commercial banking, and global corporate investment banking segment, our three versions, [Indiscernible] the team they\u2019ve actually hired over a 100 people, loan officers this year. So they could add 10% to 15% growth on loan officers. Got them hired and they are working, it takes time for them to get up to speed. [Alistair] [ph] looking at our middle market business. I think there\u2019s about 60 this year something like that, 70 people delivering and running products and things behind that also is treasury services people. </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So again capacity expansion in the global corp investment bank work differently. As we look at middle market I think that is scenario where we are, we used to think if we are going to take 10 let\u2019s only take 8, that\u2019s better. We are now telling our teams, we need to understand why you are not taking 10 if that\u2019s our whole limit and our capacity in a given transactions as example and they are doing that. So I think we are probably creating a little more not risk rating type of supply but just take a little bit more loans because we are twice the equity we used to be. And therefore we can absorb it and the team does a great job in credit quality there. So I\u2019d say if you look at across the board, consumer is more delivery capacity and commercial it\u2019s more both delivery capacity and then as you cite take a little more risk in terms of dollar denomination but not in terms of [Indiscernible] credit quality. </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ken Usdin</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay, got it, and then Paul one quick follow up on GWIM, just remind us how that business kind of marks itself in terms of the asset level pricing versus the transactions. It seems like there was kind of went in different directions this quarter and the result was kind of flattish on a revenue perspective. So what do we need to think about in terms of where the markets have come and where we are looking ahead in terms of assets levels versus transaction type revenue activity?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So we continue to grow AUM and that\u2019s all good. I mean we grew it a little bit slower this quarter but in a bad market environment we continue to grow AUM, we continue to grow deposits, we continue to grow loans. So I think everyone is doing their job. You are right, that when market activity is lower we tend to see less activity in the transactional side of that business. There is a lot of new issuance there, mutual funds, other products that just don't come to market. And so that sort of exacerbates things when the markets are bad. Does that answer your question?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And we are going to take our next question from Nancy Bush with NAB Research. </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Good morning Nancy. </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Nancy Bush</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Good morning guys, how are you? Two questions, one there is an issue out there I think this was supposed to happen in 2018 on credit quality, it is this current expected credit loss. Can you just tell us where the argument is about that right now and whether you have been able to do any preliminary work about how that would impact you?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian T. Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I don\u2019t think - the idea about like a loan type of reserving on the commercial - all loans is out there. It\u2019s -- the FASB is working on it, I think there has been voluminous comments, big questions about it. But when it comes out it will be basically a one-time adjustment type of thing and then it will be over with and -- and so over a course of time it should come out the same because you think about it, this as just putting it all - you put the loans on in the commercial side especially be changed. So, we\u2019ll get to that when we get to that but it hasn\u2019t been clarified what the rule is; lots of people commented on it and it would be a one-time thing and as you say somewhere out in 18 is what people currently think.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Nancy Bush</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay, secondly, another credit quality question. I mean there was a lot of speculation before the quarter that and I think this is probably based on the energy outlook that this would be the \u201cinflection point quarter\u201d and beginning to build reserves but what you are saying and what JP Morgan said yesterday was that the credit quality outlook remains pretty stable. Can you just comment on this inflection point issue and when you think we will get there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">We\u2019re still seeing reserve releases on the consumer side of the bank that is certainly starting to moderate. And consistent with loan growth we\u2019re seeing some reserve additions on the commercial side of the bank. And as I said earlier if you are looking for when those lines are going to cross we think provision as Brian and I both said is going to be roughly sort of 800 million to 900 million in 2016, that\u2019s kind of where the conversion is going to happen, some place - per quarter, that is some place in 2016. </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian T. Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Nancy remember we still have massive risk coming off in consumer that we are not - reserves are going over the commercial side and some is coming out net of that 100 plus million this quarter. We expect that to probably mitigate and then if you get loan reserve you\u2019ll build reserves at some point but I think that is still a bit out there. </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Nancy Bush</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So sometime in 2016, probably?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian T. Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">It depends on what the loan growth is, it depends on the economic scenario. But I think it\u2019s -- we\u2019re still repositioning reserves on the consumer side that are excess, as we can see in the credit statistics. We\u2019re carrying a healthy reserve for areas that have continued to come down in terms of risk.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Nancy Bush</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay, thank you. </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Our next question comes from Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets. </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Thomas LeTrent</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Good morning guys, it\u2019s actually Thomas LeTrent on behalf of Paul. Most have been asked and answered but one quick question on the servicing side, the servicing income has been coming down at sort of a faster rate than the portfolio and I know you guys have sort of exited most of the sales on the portfolio side, so at what point can we sort of expect the fees to level off and is that just a function of the legacy stuff continuing to run off?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian T. Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">If you go to page 17 you can see that the rate of reduction will come down -- will slow down, but it will still come down on of the theory the units doing. Remember the other issue we have is we\u2019re holding more of the loans so that from a corporate perspective that also has an effect here comes in - in yield or not in servicing fees. So expect the fee to work its way down but it is 345 this quarter I think, 300-ish is where ought to flatten out. </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Thomas LeTrent</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay, and then also on slide 17 if I may, on the 60 days delinquent how much of that is the quarterly change, how much of that is from sales there, is that mostly just run off?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Most of it is just run off. </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian T. Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">We are just working it out, and so we still got a room to go to get it normalized but there is nothing big material going on in terms of sales and stuff this quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Thomas LeTrent</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay, that\u2019s all, thank you. </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And we\u2019ll take today\u2019s last question from Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead. </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Hi, I had three small questions; first, you sold $3.6 billion of assets, mortgages, and NPLs, what was the gain or sale on those sales, I am sorry the gain or loss?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">In total our gain on all our loan sales in the quarter 400 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I am sorry, 400 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">400 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay, that added a little bit, should we assume that repeats or this is kind of a one off?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian T. Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Mike, it\u2019s in the puts and takes we put on the first slide there. </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay, that is fine. Higher rates, you are more asset sensitive now I guess 4.5 billion to 100 basis points, you are 3.9 billion last quarter. Are you intentionally -- I mean, how do you think about that, are you leaving money on the table by being so asset sensitive, do you want to be this asset sensitive, maybe give the answer in the context to the last jobs report which seems to imply rates will increase later than previously expected?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">We have not changed how we manage these rates in the company. All that happened was long end rates went down from Q2 to Q3 increasing\u2026</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian T. Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">The FAS91 is really the major difference. </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And then lastly, Paul you are new on the job as CFO, actually Brian this is the first call when we can ask the question why did the old CFO leave and we have heard a lot of different reports to why the last CFO leave and Paul, as you are new on the job as CFO what changes might you want to make and Paul or Brian if rates don\u2019t go up for a lot longer than you expected, what is your Plan B to deal with the tougher environment?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian T. Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So, let me answer that and I am going to let Paul talk about three months ago; Bruce has served as Chief Risk Officer and CFO for a combined six years and wanted to get back and run a business or do something different. And so we announced that and Paul became CFO. There is nothing new to add. In terms of what we do in the environment, as we have said a lot of times to earlier questions, we continue to be able to hold the core expenses flat while we make the investments pay - the increased CCAR expenses pay for the cost of repositioning the franchise, severance and everything and we will continue to work at it. If the environment changed and we didn\u2019t think we\u2019re getting returns from that, [we\u2019ll just go] [ph] for the long-term interest of our shareholders, we would reduce the investment rate. </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And Paul philosophy on being CFO, any changes with your predecessor?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I think it is a little early for me to have developed a plan in terms of radical change. We have -- Bruce did a tremendous job of cleaning up the balance sheet and positioning our company for growth. He -- we have got a great team that he built and I am getting to know all that and we will see how it goes. </p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Alright, thank you. </p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And as it appears we have no further questions, I would like to return the program to Mr. Lee McEntire for closing remarks. </p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Lee McEntire</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Thanks for joining everybody. We will talk to you next quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And this does conclude today's program.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later you will have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this call may be recorded. I'll be standing by if you should need any assistance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. Lee McEntire.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Lee McEntire</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning. Thanks to everybody on the phone, thanks for those that are joining us on the webcast as well. Welcome to the fourth quarter earnings results presentation. Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to review the earnings that we released. It is available on the Bank of America Investor Relations website.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">And so before I turn over the call over to Brian and Paul, let me remind you we may make some forward-looking statements. For further information of those, please refer to either our earnings release documents on our website or our SEC filings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">So with that, I will turn it over to our CEO, Brian Moynihan.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you, Lee, and good morning. Thanks to all of you for joining us this morning to discuss our fourth quarter results. Before Paul Donofrio takes you through the details of the quarter, I just want to provide some overall context on our progress in 2015 and the opportunities and challenges ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">As you know, for the fourth quarter, we reported $3.3 billion in earnings or $0.28 per diluted share. For 2015 we had net income of $15.9 billion, that's the highest net income we've had in a long time. Full year return metrics were 74 basis points for ROA and 9% for return on tangible common equity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">During 2015 we continued to drive our 8 lines of business forward. We've focused on driving responsible growth across all our businesses and as you look at the annual earnings of the company and see how they fell, you can see how they came through.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Our consumer and wealth management businesses serving mass market customers all the way to the wealthiest Americans delivered $9.3 billion in net income this year. Our Global Banking business which provides services to small, medium and large companies around the world, produced $5.3 billion in net income this year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Within our institutional investor clients our markets business with its market leading research capabilities and the top tier platform across the globe delivered $3 billion in earnings after adjusting for DVA in a very challenging market.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">What's clear in these earnings despite the gyrations of markets especially at the end of the year last year is annuity nature that we get from our franchise by driving customer and client flows. That's the power of our company, it\u2019s balancing the scope and a strong customer base and we aim to continue to improve it every day for our clients and customers and our shareholders. These results reflect the work we've done over the past several years to develop a more straightforward and simplified operating model and focus on responsible growth.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">As you see on slide 2, across the variety of measures, loan growth business activity, capital liquidity, credit losses and cost management, we've made meaningful progress and believe we are positioned for a variety of economic cycles. At the foundation of all this is a strong capital and liquidity base. We added to our record liquidity levels in 2015 and we believe we are well positioned against the 2017 LCR requirements with total global excess liquidity sources now at over $500 billion. This amount represents nearly a quarter of our balance sheet and we now have enough [indiscernible] liquidity to last more than three years before we need to tap the market for funding.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Now our liquidity levels were driven by strong growth in deposits this year and we were able to put that funding to work to grow loans on an absolute basis for the first time in several years. Loan growth was all driven by organic activity and is consistent with our risk posture.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Our tangible common equity of $162 billion is at record levels as well. We returned $4.5 billion to shareholders this year in common dividends and share repurchases. Our tangible book value per share improved 8% in the past 12 months to a new high of $15.62. Our responsible lending focus also shows in our underwriting results. Our net charge-offs were down just $4.3 billion this year, consistent with 2014 but much lower than previous years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Commercial charge-offs increased off a very low base mostly from oil related charge-offs while consumer losses as a core continued to improve. This reflects further responsible underwriting as continued improvement in our legacy portfolios.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">And finally we get to the cost management side. At the heart of our work has been improving expenses which you can see are down sequentially from last year mostly on lower litigation costs, but also on improved LAS and other operating costs and these have improved steadily across the last several years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We began new a BAC in 2011 and completed it in 2014. Since then we have been using our Simplify and Improve initiatives to find savings that more than offset increased compliance, merit and other inflationary costs. But most importantly those savings fund investments in our business whether it is in technology or sales force growth or other infrastructure costs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">As we move to slide 3, we included a few examples of trends, business activity in our consumer side of the house and wealth management side of the house. As you can see, we grew average deposits in consumer banking and wealth management business is $52 billion or 7% comparing year-over-year fourth quarter periods. These deposits were up over $105 billion in core deposits at the end of 2012.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">This strong organic growth is the result of hard work in improving the customer satisfaction in our franchise by making it easier for customers to do business with [indiscernible] and strong product management simplifying the product set. All this has been done, where we've optimized our delivery networks, reducing our financial standards, divesting certain markets and also expanding our award winning mobile capabilities in the customer base that uses that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">As you can see this work also extends to our wealth management business. We had long-term net flows every quarter for six and a half years in wealth management. We have record loan levels and significant higher deposit levels, good products and [advisers] [ph], a growing sales force and two of the leading brands in business positions us well here..</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Let me move to our global banking markets area. You can see on the institutional side of the [house] [ph] that\u2019s set out forth on slide 4, we saw solid activity in 2015. Loans to commercial and corporate clients around the globe are growing nicely. Client demand has been good and our bankers have met our challenge to capture market share responsibly. This focus allows us to demonstrate a strong 12% growth in loans through global banking in the past 12 months and you can see the deposit growth has been strong here in the last year as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">If you look at the markets business Tom Montag and team have done a good job of reducing assets and lowered the risk and still are generating relatively stable revenues. Despite the recent market challenges we remained quite profitable in this business and well positioned around the globe with both a strong [FICC] [ph] and equity platform.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">As we step back we remain focused on our core customer strategy. We will continue to invest in the future and even as we continue to address the legacy issues of the past. We've been able to grow even as operating and economic environment remains in a low growth mode. Our model is solid but there is still plenty of work to do, but also there is plenty of opportunity ahead for us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Overall I am pleased with the progress made in 2015 and we have more to do in 2016. In 2016 you should expect us to continue to focus on responsible growth. We will continue to drive the investments made in our franchise to deliver the value to you the shareholders. We will continue our sharp focus on risk management and we will continue our cost discipline as we look to continue to improve return on capital \u2013 capital metrics of our company.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">With that, let me hand it over to Paul.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"><strong>Paul Donofrio</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Thank you, Brian, and good morning everyone. Starting on slide 5, we present a summary of the income statement and returns for this quarter as well as the fourth quarter of last year which had similar seasonal aspects. We earned $3.3 billion in the quarter compared to earnings of $3.1 billion in 4Q 2014. Earnings per diluted share this quarter were $0.28, up 12% versus a year ago.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">The results include two significant charges that were previously announced and impacted EPS by $0.06. First, we recorded a pretax charge of $612 million associated with trust preferred securities which phased out of tier two capital at the end of 2015. Second we had a tax charge of $290 million associated with the UK tax changes that were enacted during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Lastly we had a few other items that benefited the EPS this quarter by a penny on a net basis. These included a negative net DVA impact in sales and trading that was more than offset by positive impacts of market related adjustments in net interest income and some one-off tax benefits.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Revenue on an FTE basis was $19.8 billion this quarter up 4% from Q4 2014. Expenses were $13.9 billion approximately $300 million or 2% lower than a year ago driven by good expense discipline across the company.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We also provide returns and a few other metrics on this page, I would remind you that client activity and revenue in our global market segment tend to be lower or lowest in the fourth quarter affecting returns on other statistics.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Lastly, as many of you are aware, there was a recent accounting change that required certain unrealized debit valuation adjustments to be recorded directly to OCI rather than through the P&amp;L. We early adopted this change effective as of the beginning of 2015. The slide and the supplemental earnings material that was in 2015 results have been adjusted.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to slide 6 and focusing on the balance sheet, we grew deposits by $35 billion from Q3 and we used these increased deposits to fund responsible loan growth. In total assets climbed $9 million as increases in loans and security balances of $30 billion were more than offset by reductions in trading related assets and cash.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Liquidity rose to just over $500 billion, a record level, and time to required funding remains over three years. Tangible common equity of $152 billion improved modestly in Q3 as earnings were offset by both the return of $1.3 billion in capital to common shareholders and negative OCI driven by security values. Tangible book value per share increased to $15.62, another new record high.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to regulatory metrics we began recording regulatory capital under the advanced approaches for the first time this quarter, and the CET1 transition ratio under Basel 3 ended the quarter at 10.2 and really has no comparable metrics as transition ratios in prior periods were reported under the standardized approach with lower RWA levels. On a fully phased-in basis, CET1 capital improved modestly to $154.1 billion under the advanced approaches compared to Q3 2015 pro forma estimates the CET1 ratio increased slightly to 9.8%. RWA was essentially flat as growth from commercial exposures was mostly offset by lower activity and balance sheet levels in our global markets segment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We also provide our capital metrics under the standardized approach. Here our CET1 ratio was flat at 10.8% with modest improvements in capital offset by modest increase in RWA. In terms of the supplementary leverage ratios we estimate that as of 12/31 we continue to exceed U.S. rules applicable beginning in 2018 at both the parent and bank.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to slide 7, we had strong loan and deposit growth this quarter. Reported loans on an end of period basis increased $15 billion from Q3. This is the third consecutive quarter of recorded increases in total loan balances. We continue to see solid loan demand in our primary lending businesses partially offset by runoff in LAS and all other.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Excluding declines in LAS and all other, ending loans in our primary lending segments increased $22 billion from Q3. $8 billion of this increase was in consumer loans as GWIM increased mortgages and security based lending. Consumer banking also saw good loan growth in mortgages as well as vehicle loans.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We also had some seasonal growth in credit card partially offset by selling $1.7 billion of card receivables at the end of the quarter. Commercial loans grew $15 billion spread across multiple industry groups.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to deposits, on many basis they reached nearly $1.2 trillion this quarter growing $78 billion or 7% in Q4 2014. Growth was solid across the franchise. Consumer led the way growing 9% year-over-year while global banking and GWIM each grew at 6% pace.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to asset quality on slide 8, while still strong we did see net charge-offs increase modestly from recent levels. Total net charge-offs increased $212 million versus Q3, $144 million was from consumer items previously reserved for and lower recoveries on the sale of NPL in the fourth quarter versus Q3. We also saw a $73 million increase in net charge-offs from our energy portfolio. Outside of these two areas, net charge-offs were stable compared to Q3.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Provision of $110 million in Q4 was relatively flat with Q3. Reserve releases in consumer real estate and credit card were partially offset by reserve builds in commercial which was driven by increase in criticized exposures as well as loan growth. Reserve releases excluding the previously reserved items I mentioned earlier were roughly $200 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On slide 9 we provide credit quality data on our consumer portfolio. Net charge-offs increased $137 million. The two items of note that make up this increase were reserved for in prior periods and did not impact the provision expense in the quarter. $119 million was the result of collateral valuation adjustments. In addition, we had some small charge-offs associated with our 2014 DOJ settlement. We expect to complete our commitments under this settlement in the first half of 2016.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Adjusting for these two items, consumer net charge-offs were relatively flat versus Q3. Delinquency levels and NPLs continue to decline and reserve coverage remained strong.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Moving to our commercial side, on slide 10, net charge-offs increased $75 million primarily from losses in our energy portfolio. Outside of the energy portfolio, commercial losses remained very low. Given the focus on the impacts of low oil prices on companies in the energy sector, we want to spend a minute to describe our energy portfolio and provide some perspectives.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">The pie chart break down our $21 billion utilized exposure to the energy sector. This represents a little more than 2% of our total loan balances. Within that $21 billion $8.3 billion or less than 1% of the total loans is loans to borrowers in two subsectors, Exploration and Production as well as Oil Field Services. We consider these two subsectors to have significantly higher risk than the rest of the energy portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Of our $8.3 billion utilized exposure to these two higher risk subsectors $2.9 billion has already been downgraded to criticized. So 35% of the higher risk subsectors has already been downgraded to reservable criticized exposure thereby driving a portion of the reserves. And allowances for loan losses for the entire energy portfolio is approximately $500 million or 6% of the funded exposure of these two subsectors.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">The company in the vertically integrated subsector represents $5.8 billion of the energy portfolio. We believe this subsector has a better ability to withstand lower oil prices. Nearly 100% of the companies have a market capital of $10 billion or more or they are sovereign owned and the average company has a market cap greater than $60 billion. We believe the remaining exposure in Refining and Marketing as well as other is also less dependent on oil prices.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">As part of our standard risk management process, we stress test our credit portfolios including our energy portfolio. Our stress analysis of the energy portfolio includes various sustained low oil prices over extended periods. As an example, if we held oil prices at $30 per barrel for nine quarters we estimate our potential losses on the energy portfolio would be roughly $700 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">In energy and across our commercial sector, we continue to support clients while managing lending limits and actively engaging with stressed borrowers. Before moving from asset quality I want to refocus on total provision expense and how one should think about it over the next couple of quarters. As we continue to assess and react to future changes in the energy sector we could see lumpiness that could potentially drive provision expense over $900 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Turning to net interest income on slide 11, on an FTE basis NII was $10 billion increasing roughly $300 million from Q3. NII included a negative $612 million charge associated with three trust preferred securities. These securities were scheduled to be completely phased out of tier 2 capital as of January 01, and with 7% to 8% coupons became expensive debt. NII also included a $150 million of positive market related adjustments to the amortization of bond premiums under FAS 91.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">NII excluding market related adjustments and the charge on the trust preferred improved $188 million from Q3 to $10.5 billion. This improvement was driven by increased deposit balances which we used to fund growth in loans and securities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">As we move into the first quarter, please note the following: first, we will have one less day of interest. Second, recent changes by Congress will lower the amount of dividends we receive from the FRB by approximately $50 million a quarter. Having said that, if the forward curve is realized and if we have some modest deposit and loan growth we still expect to show some growth in NII in Q1 2016 relative to our adjusted NII of $10.5 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">With regards to asset sensitivity, at the end of the fourth quarter our overall asset sensitivity decreased slightly as a result of increases in long-end rates as well as security balances. As of 12/31 an instantaneous 100 basis points parallel increase in rates is estimated to increase NII by approximately $4.3 billion over the subsequent year. Although more than half of that improvement comes from the increases in short-end rates and a little less than one quarter of the benefit comes from market related adjustments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Turning to expenses on slide 12, non-interest expense was $13.9 billion in Q4, $300 million lower than Q4 2014. This was driven by good expense discipline across the company. Litigation expense was a little higher this quarter at $428 million exhibiting some lumpiness as we work to resolve legacy issues. Keep in mind that annual litigation expense decreased from $16.4 billion in 2014 to $1.2 billion in 2015. Legacy asset servicing cost excluding litigation finished Q4 a little better than our targets of $800 million. As we have said, our net goal is $500 million per quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Expenses excluding litigation and LAS were $12.6 billion and represents the fifth quarter out of the past six below $12.8 billion. We continue to look for ways to streamline and simplify how we do business. This is important because it allows us to invest in growth while maintaining relatively flat core expenses and a sluggish revenue environment. And importantly this relevant flatness continued even as we invested in additional sales professionals and improved technologies.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Looking towards expenses in 2016 let me remind you, in the first quarter we will record as normal approximately $1 billion in cost for retirement eligible incentives. In addition, the first quarter strictly includes seasonably higher payroll taxes of roughly $300 million. And if we experience traditional rebound in Q1 sales and trading revenue, this would also increase incentives and other associated costs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Turning to the business segments and starting with consumer banking on slide 13, consumer earned $1.8 billion, 9% greater than Q4 last year. These results reflect good operating leverage on increased customer activities. The segment generated a strong 25% return on allocated capital. Revenue of $7.8 billion was up modestly from Q4 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Net interest income benefited from higher deposit and loan levels. Noninterest income was down slightly from lower mortgage banking. The decline in mortgage revenue reflects selling fewer nonperforming loans as we hold more on our balance sheet. In addition there was absence of $30 million in quarterly from the Q3 sale of the small noncore appraisal business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Expenses declined 2% from Q4 2014 as the savings from reduction in financial centers and personnel more than offset higher product costs and investment in increased sales specialists. The cost of operating deposit franchise remains low at 177 basis points. Operating leverage drove improvements in the efficiency ratio of 56% as we continue to experience shifts in customer activity away from branches towards self-serve options.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Mobile banking users increased to 18.7 million which is up 13% from Q4 2014 and deposit transactions from these devices now represent 15% of deposit transactions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Slide 14 presents consumer progress across a number of customer activities. I will highlight activities in three areas, loans, deposits and brokerage assets where we continue to grow responsibly. These three products are at the core of our rewards programs where we share benefits with customers who deepen relationships with us. Average loans grew $12 billion from Q4 2014 in mortgages and vehicle lending. And in deposit growth was strong at $48 billion or 9% from Q4 while the rate paid declined to 4 basis points.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Regarding brokerage assets, Merrill Edge assets levels of $123 billion are up 8% from last year even with declines in equity markets this year. Total mortgage production was up 13% from Q4 last year and stable with Q3.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Looking at card activity which includes GWIM, card issuance was strong at $1.3 million. Average U.S. card balances of $89 billion were down modestly from last year, but up seasonally from Q3 2015. U.S. card credit quality was strong as net charge-offs remained at decades low levels of 2.5% with risk adjusted margin of 9.4%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Credit spending volumes finished on a high note as Q4 spending was 5% higher than last year outpacing what we believe to be total market spend levels. Debit spending was strong as well. For example, on Christmas Eve day we saw record debit credit spending of more than $1 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">In our consumer segment we expect technology adoption by customers to continue to be a cornerstone of not only improved customer satisfaction, but also efficiency gains and operating leverage. The latest examples of this are around digital selling and appointment setting. Digital sales in the fourth quarter were up more than 31% from last year. Digital appointments reached more than 16,000 recently. We expect these adoption trends to play an increasing role in future performance in customer satisfaction as we continue to advance online and mobile capabilities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Turning to slide 15, global wealth and investment management produced earnings of $614 million. Results were down from Q4 last year driven by lower transactional revenue and the impact of the market decline on asset management fees.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Transactional revenue continues to be impacted by the shifting of activity from brokerage to managed relationships as well as market uncertainty. NII benefited from solid loan growth and solid deposit growth but was offset by the company\u2019s ALM activities leaving NII relatively flat with Q4, 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Non-interest expense was modestly higher than the year ago period. Investment in client facing professionals continues while lower revenue caused a decline in incentive compensations that was more than offset by amortization of stock awards issued in prior periods. Pretax margin was 21% down from Q4, 2014. Beginning in the first quarter of 2016 we will benefit from lower expense resulting from the completion of amortizations related to advisor retention awards given at the time of the Merrill Lynch merger.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Moving to slide 16, despite the volatility and market levels we continued to see solid client activity and we continued to invest in the business growing wealth advisors 5% from Q4 last year. Long-term AUM flows were $7 billion and remained positive for the 26th consecutive quarter. Deposit flows were strong, growing end of period balances $15 billion from Q3. By the way, this may have been driven in part by client concerns of market volatility. Loans continued to grow improving 10% from last year. This is the 23rd consecutive quarter of average loan growth in this segment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Turning to slide 17, global banking earned $1.4 billion down 9% from Q4, 2014 but still generating a 16% return on allocated capital. The earnings decline from Q4 was driven by higher provision expense. Provision expense was up $264 million from Q4 last year driven by higher energy related charge-offs and reserve build to loan growth and energy related risks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Revenue increased modestly from Q4, 2014 while expense declined modestly. Driven by higher loan balances NII improved despite spread compression and the allocation of the company\u2019s ALM activities including higher liquidity costs. Non-interest income benefited from higher treasury services revenue, higher leasing revenue and a small gain from the sale of its foreclosed property, partially offset by lower IB fees.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Looking at trends on slide 18 and comparing to Q4, 2014, IB fees of $1.3 billion were down 17% as leverage finance and equity issuance was partially offset by advisory fees that were at second highest level since the Merrill merger.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">From a market share perspective we maintained our number three global fee ranking. Looking at the balance sheet loans on average were $320 billion up 12% year-over-year. The growth was broad based across C&amp;I, real estate and leasing. We continued to experience some spread compression although it has moderated relative to a year ago.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Asset quality of new loans was consistent with the overall portfolio. On deposits we saw good performance with average deposits increasing by $16 billion or 5% over Q4, 2014. The mix of these deposits remained very good with less than 5% classified as 100% runoff of balances.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Switching to global markets on slide 19 and comparing to Q4 last year, we are pleased with the results here given challenging market conditions as the teams increased revenue while using lower asset levels and less VAR. Global markets earned approximately $200 million but we think one should consider results excluding DVA. On that basis adjusted earnings were $308 million which was relatively flat to Q4, 2014 on a similarly adjusted basis. Note that our net DVA loss this quarter was $198 million and compared to a loss of $626 million in Q4 2014 which included an initial FVA adjustment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Total revenue excluding DVA improved $330 million or 10% from the fourth quarter last year on improved FICC sales and trading. Outside of sales and trading global market's share of lower investment banking fees was offset by a gain on the sale of an equity investment. Non-interest expenses increased 9% in line with revenue improvement.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Moving to trends on the next slide and focusing on the components of our sales and trading performance, sales and trading revenue are up $2.6 billion excluding net DVA was up 11.5% in Q4 of 2014. Compared to Q4 last year FICC sales and trading of $1.8 billion improved 20% reflecting improvements across most products notably in rates and credit related products. Equity trading of $822 million declined 3% reflecting lower client activity. Average trading related asset levels were down 9% in Q4 2014 while VAR was down 14%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Turning to legacy assets and servicing on slide 21, this segment lost roughly $350 million in line with the prior year. Focused areas here are mortgage banking income, the number of delinquent loans and expenses all compared to Q4 2014. First, mortgage banking income which improved slightly was driven by three factors, revenue warranty provisioning improved $237 million to provision of $9 million this quarter. That favorability was offset by a decline in servicing fees of $108 million as the units service declined as well as a decline in net MSR hedge performance of $152 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Next the number of first mortgage loans that we serviced that are 60 day delinquent continued to decline and are now at 103,000 units. And last, the team did an excellent job lowering expenses. Excluding litigation we achieved our goal of $800 million moving costs down $309 million or 28%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">On slide 22, we show all other which reported a loss of $289 million. This was an improvement of $86 million from Q4 2014. This loss was driven by $612 million pretax charge associated with our trust preferred as well as the impact on the UK tax law changes. This was partially offset by gains on debt security sales as well as reserved leases on consumer real estate loans booked in all other.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">[Audit Start]A comment or two on taxes before wrapping up. The Company\u2019s effective tax rate for the quarter excluding the UK tax charge was 25% reflecting reoccurring tax benefits plus a few small one-off benefits. We would expect the tax rate to be in the low 30s for 2016 excluding unusual items.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Before closing, I want to cover our early adoption of DVA accounting in more detail. In January of this year the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an update to allow early adoption of a new rule regarding recognition of DVA on financial liabilities from changes in our own credit spreads.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">The update means that these types of debit valuation adjustments will now flow through OCI instead of the income statement. We believe this change makes our earnings comparison more meaningful and easier to understand, therefore we adopted early. We restated all periods this year per FASB rules and those numbers are contained in the supplemental package.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">This had no impact on capital as it moved on between retained earnings in the OCI but it did impact revenue, earnings, taxes and EPS in the first three quarters of 2015. The changes reduced previously reported EPS by approximately $0.02 each in Q1, Q2 and Q3. This accounting standard adoption did not impact DVA on derivatives which continued to flow through trading account profits .</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay let me conclude by offering a few takeaways. Although the U.S. economy is improving slowly, revenue growth remains challenging. This quarter we continued our progress on those things we can control and drive. These include delivering for clients and customers within our risk framework and driving client and customer activity that will result in sustainable profits and returns. Our results reflect this focus.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">We maintained a strong foundation of capital and liquidity. We grew loans, deposits and investment flows. We continue to invest in our franchise by adding sales professionals and improved technology. Our strength, global capability and experience allowed us to deliver for clients in a challenging market environment and we did all of this while closely managing expenses. With that, we\u2019ll open it up for Q&amp;A.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p9\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Good morning, Matt.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Can you talk about the outlook for the core cost beyond some of the lumpy items in 1Q and then specifically maybe comment on how you feel like your markets business is sized? We have obviously seen some cost savings announcements that your U.S. and non-U.S. peers and want to get sense of how you feel you\u2019re positioned for the markets?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">This quarter the fourth quarter I think represents as I said in the comments, the fifth out of six that we have been below $12.8 billion. As you know, I think we\u2019ve been talking about maintaining core expenses below $13 million. So we feel really good about our progress. And to remind everybody that we are maintaining those core expenses at those levels while we\u2019re investing in front office professionals, while we\u2019re investing in technology, while we\u2019re absorbing the natural increase in pay for employees and fraud cost and CCAR costs and other things. So I think we feel good about the work we\u2019re doing there. In terms of global markets, what was the question?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Just in terms of the staffing and the positioning there, how you feel for, I don\u2019t know about the current environment, but just not bouncing back in a big, big way and obviously we\u2019re seeing reductions being announced at some of your U.S. and non U.S. peers. So how are you thinking about the sizing of your business for the environment you expect?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Matt, in the fourth quarter we did reduce headcount in the business, the markets businesses and the related capital markets business, we didn\u2019t make big announcements, but that led to the $130 million in severance in the fourth quarter numbers you see. So it will continue to adjust that headcount. Tom and his team will continue to adjust, as they made an adjustment headcount for the quarter just did not make quite the press other people\u2019s did.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">The other thing I will add Matt is my focus is on core expenses. We\u2019re still \u2013 we\u2019re going to see core expenses I think continue to come down as we work on LAS and continue to hopefully see some moderation in legal expenses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And just on the timing of the LAS getting to that below $500 million, you did disclose a big drop in the headcount if we look year-over-year and obviously there is a delay in terms of the cost in sales coming down, but what\u2019s the timing of getting to that $500 million or below?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. I think we've made great progress in terms of getting expenses down I think we started at what $3.1 billion quarters ago, but we've made great progress getting down to $800 million. We are \u2013 our next milestone is $500 million per quarter. That\u2019s going to be a little bit harder, as you get lower and lower it will be more unpredictable and so we\u2019re not really giving up a target at this time, but we\u2019re going to get there as soon as we can.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">You should expect us to make good progress, Matt, towards this year and so as you look towards the end of the year we should be getting there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">We\u2019ll move next to Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Hi good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Good morning, Betsy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I just wanted to dig in on a couple of things, one was on energy since it\u2019s flavor of the day, you gave a lot of color there and you indicated that those $30 holds for nine quarters that is a loss of $700 million. I just wanted to understand is that already reserved for or is that over and above \u2013 case if we go below $30 what you've got baked in? Because I don\u2019t it\u2019s linear, I was just wanting to understand how you are thinking about it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Sure, look as we said in comments we have got reserves against that energy portfolio of $500 million, that is 6% of the high risk subsectors and we developed reserves on incurred basis, we developed them by looking at loss give default, probability of default, exposure to default. We go loan by loan we have lot of imprecision, other factors if you look at imprecision, we put judgement on all of that. One of the things we look at when we come up with our judgment of what we should be is our stress testing and so that\u2019s how that gets factored in, to our reserve which again has to be on an incurred basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Right, so when you indicated that if $30 holds for nine quarters your models suggests a loss of $700 million that\u2019s already reserved for or is that on top of what you already have reserved?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">In part that because the idea is it can only incur what you see through today in terms of the operating structure these companies and asset based on lending, these are asset based loans, these are based loans. [Audio Gap] if you are nine quarters from now and oil is still at that price you\u2019d have to have a reserve for what\u2019s left of the portfolio of the exposures been coming down, it will come down during those nine quarters, by losses you took at least in resolving this credit. So it's in part covered, but not fully because that\u2019s an estimate of our future that we as Paul said it\u2019s an incurred view of the portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">\u2026 we got $500 million reserve, as we go theoretically goes to the nine quarters if that $700 million would come true of our model is perfect, it would go against that $500 million to be building reserves as you went through that process. So if you told me what you want at the end of nine quarters, that if you want to end at $500 million you can do the math if you want it to end up that more or less it's going to be more or less in terms of you kind of built.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And then could you talk a little bit about the reserve release that\u2019s still possible from the other portfolios, you have $200 million reserve release this past quarter, just wondering what the lags are on that, we've seen other institutions, they essentially finish up the reserve release? I know you had a big legacy book so maybe there is a little more lags there, I just wanted to understand how you\u2019re thinking about the trajectory there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I think you got it, I think we have a legacy we have a large legacy portfolio on the consumer side as we continued to work through that. And if home prices continue to stay where they are and improve the economy stays we\u2019re already improved. I think you are going to continue to see reserve from us in 2016, our reserve releases as I should say from us in 2016, but they are going to moderate from what they have been in the past.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay, so there is still some lags, but at decelerating pace ?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes, that some of that swings over to the commercial book, yes as we saw this quarter, Betsy. So we have come down from a lot of reserve releases last year, $800 million or so in the fourth quarter last year $7 million or $8 million or so in the fourth quarter last year certainly is heardings down to the two couple hundred million is expect that to kind of mitigate during the course of 2016.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes and we've built reserves in the commercial.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">All right. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We\u2019ll move next to John McDonald of Bernstein. Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Hi, good morning. Paul I was recalling I think you had for a goal as you had to generate positive operating leverage. I was wondering how you feel about the ability to achieve that, what kind of revenue environment are you planning for and how will you managed expenses try to get some positive operating leverage this year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I think we feel good about the operating leverage we achieved in 2015. You can see that with the revenue growth relative to the EPS growth and I think we are looking to continue that trend. We have a little bit of a tailwind here on rates we're going to continue to manage expenses carefully. So in terms of our EPS in 2016 we don\u2019t give estimates, but in terms of EPS growth in 2016 I think it will be more of the same revenue growth with some hopefully expense discipline that will get us a some operating leverage.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay and Brian, could you talk a little bit about what your goals will be with your 2016 CCAR submission are you looking to make some progress on both the dividend and buyback potentially and do you may be can share some thoughts about that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">John, we have not seen a scenario as yet and stuff like that, so I think it is probably premature to discuss that. Our goal is long term is to return more and more capital to shareholders through dividend and stock buybacks, at this price obviously stock buybacks are favored, but when we see the scenario and play that out it would be getting ahead of the process and talk about today.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay and Paul one quick follow up on the NII, is there a benefit from the paid down of trust preferred that you will get in 2016 is that why you\u2019re able to grow the core and NII bit in 2016?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I won't say don\u2019t say that\u2019s why, but honestly there is a benefit from paying off those trust preferred they had I think with the $175 million in quarter and so there is a benefit there. But the way I would think about those is we\u2019re not going to \u201creplace them\u201d because they don\u2019t count toward our regulatory capital, so why would we replace them? We're going to have a capital structure that meets our regulatory requirements which requires a certain amount CET1. We are going to have the appropriate amount off preferred and something that\u2019s and - of course we have to meet \u2013 so that\u2019s how I would think about it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay and so it's really just the loan growth and pretty stable rates driving some core NII growth?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">John, if you look at it \u2013 what was affecting us '13, '14 was we've continued to run our portfolios that yield to them. And obviously the reinvestment rates on the investment side of the house as we ran those off were flattish. That is kind of all run through the system, so now what we\u2019re seeing is $80 billion of a period deposit growth from fourth quarter last year and this year and the overall pay rate for that is in the low single digit basis points all for, all the consumer wealth management and driven by middle market and the banking business. So that is the deposit funding side. And the asset build is now good core loans that have reasonable yields to them and you start to see it and then pick up just a hair from that. And we expect it to drive in our core as long as the economy continues to grow a couple of percent.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Hey, John just real quick, I want to correct one thing I said, the 175 is full year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">We\u2019ll move next to Paul Miller of FBR and Company. Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Paul Miller</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes, thank you very much, on your NPAs, you have really good disclosure , you are getting it down to 103,000, did you sell any this quarter or is that all workouts through your servicing?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">We thought a little bit, but not as much as we had in the past, that not as much as we had in the past.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">It is very incremental at this point on the sales side.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Paul Miller</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And then when do you, I mean like, at this point when do you think you can get that down to I guess this is not a normal level because you've just got to run this whole portfolio off. I mean could you have any idea when that will be over with?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Well, Paul definitely three is the total portfolio. So there is a normal piece in that and an abnormal piece of that that we should be driving it down to the 60 days 103, across both portfolios that number should come into I don\u2019t know pick up a percent or percent and a half of the service loan unit. So it still got some room to go and that's the key that I think Matt has pointed out earlier is the FTE headcount in LAS we had a 2000 person headcount drop in the company overall in the fourth quarter about half LAS have the rest of the company.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">The LAS percentage rate is with 8 percentage points not annualized for the quarter at 30% is still dropping its headcount but is getting flatter now we get all the old cost drive out of the portfolio. So, in terms of thinking about real estate, old systems and stuff and so that\u2019s what takes a little more time now than just the people cost .</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Paul Miller</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Thanks you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">We\u2019ll move next to Jim Mitchell of Buckingham Research.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Hey, good morning may be just a quick question on deposit behavior since the rate high, have you seen anything unusual I would assume will be more in the institutional side where you\u2019ve seen movement at this point and then maybe you can kindly give some update on how you\u2019re thinking about the deposit data this year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Sure, the short answer is that we have seen no real movement of course we\u2019re very focused on making sure that we paid appropriate deposit rate, but so far there has been no movement and we have been modeling deposit betas on our interest building deposits in the high 40s.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And you still think that makes sense or do you think that\u2019s relatively conservative?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">We think that makes sense and given the quality of our deposit base as Brian sort of kind of walked through already the portion we have in our consumer and GWIM franchises, the number of primary checking accounts even on the wholesale side if you look at our deposits less than 5% of them are 100% runoff deposits. So we feel good about our $1.2 trillion deposits we took even this year the deposit rating came down another basis point to 4 basis points for the all deposit, so we feel good about that modeling.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And Jim, remember that modeling is not 40% of everything. It is a lot nothing and a lot less for the first couple of months. So I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking about, so if we continue along with one or two rate raises, there will be a lot more captured than as it gets on to the higher.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Right, it will be more backend weighted?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Exactly, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. And just one last question maybe on the expense side, if we look at, I mean you guys have done a good job, but if you look at your core expenses normalized for all the puts and takes it still seems like your efficiency ratio would be sort of in that 63%, 64% range and lot of your peers are well below 60%. Is this sort of you grow into the improving efficiency ratio with the revenue as you reinvest or is there do you think you can get there more quickly? Just trying to get a sense of how you get the trajectory into more in line with the peer group on the efficiency ratio side?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Well if you look at the full-year 2015 and you do those puts and takes for the things that we\u2019ve talked about for the year and you make any sort of a reasonable guess as the progress we\u2019re going to make around LAS, we\u2019re sort of in the kind of 65ish range, we\u2019re going to continue to focus on growing responsibly and working on our total expenses as we have talked earlier and so with a little help from growth and some more work on expenses we think we\u2019re in shooting range .</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">As we model ourselves and look at sort of the peers and so that average efficiency by business units and model against our business mix we\u2019re going to be little higher, high level wealth management in our business relative to total. But look three things on this, number one we will continue to drive \u2013 drive it down and funding all the growth in FTE for sales side we get 6% growth in consumer FTE sales side, 3% wealth management, 6% or 8%, maybe 8% global banking year-over-year. So we\u2019re paying for all that \u2013 paying for all the incentives attached, we are paying for all the infrastructure attached to it. So we're going to continue to drive it down. So just rest assured that is.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And then we are not satisfied in the mid-60s efficiency ratio of the company and we should be able to drive that down and it will come from both, its hard work as we say with the rate lift and stuff which affects -- we're still affected a little bit more by the low rates structure and other people we should pick it back up. But don\u2019t think we are complacent on this.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. I appreciate it, thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">We\u2019ll move next to Glenn Schorr of Evercore. Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Hi thanks. So I think you put the heat on a little bit on loan growth over the last couple of quarters and if you looked at lending in your primary lending segments it\u2019s picked up and I think that\u2019s good. The question I have is with new information that we have, I mean the markets digesting and anticipating, I don\u2019t know if I'll call it recession, but a lot of fear around recession on lower oil and China related fears. The question I have is, if you look at the core loan growth are you still okay running it at this level, do you feel like your customer base that you\u2019re making these new loans too are a little more insulated to the world that the market is fearful of?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">We are - outside of energy, we are not seeing asset quality change nor are we see a reduction in appetite for our credit. I would remind everybody that we look we\u2019re very, very focused on our customer framework and our risk framework, but within that framework we continue to see a lot of opportunities that help our customers grow their businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">If you look at this quarter and you just focus on the core, we had 3% quarter-over-quarter growth or an annualized growth rate of little over 12% or $22 billion, I\u2019m not going to sit here and tell you that is what is going to be next quarter, but we\u2019re not seeing material decline in conversations with our clients about how that thing grows.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I think to give additional color, if you think about it, if you go back a couple of years we grew the international business because we had to round out that franchise. We sort of slowed that down 24 months ago that started to drop in terms of growth rate and so because of the client selection criteria there is very high levels - very high clients multinational clients et cetera, but we slowed it down just to keep the company in balance and that\u2019s been on watch.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">If you think about the consumer you know there was a prime no longer FICO scores if you look at the coming on FICOs are higher than the portfolio still which is almost hard to believe, the charge-offs, delinquencies and both home equities, delinquencies across the wide score are going to continue to come get lower every year. This year was the lowest they have been, probably a long time in both the credit card and in home equities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And if you look at the client selection U.S., a couple things, one is you\u2019re adding officers in the middle market business, but they are going after our target clients and this is not go find the industries etcetera. So whether it is the way you land a commercial real estate which is down \u2013 which is very high end real estate developer etcetera, the way we land in this middle market is very strong.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So if you look across it is client section in the middle market business has been strong. The best that we're seeing is things in our business banking, small business portfolio are actually starting to see growth there sticking to our credit risk which is the first time in many years we had to run off some stuff it came in through style Merrill and everything else that we are finally seeing nominal growth.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And so I think it is client selection, we slowed down international. It sort of follows watching and in fact using your stress to make sure you stay balanced and if you look at us, yes we feel we're pretty balanced between the consumer and commercial sort of 50-50 and there within the consumer we\u2019re really sticking to our knitting which is very strong high quality, above that credit worthy borrowers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Great, one follow up on the FA growth you noted a 5% year-on-year I\u2019m just curious, that is not a heck of a lot of core growth in that business. I\u2019m just curious how much is coming from your training programs versus recruiting both traditional and non-traditional sources?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">It is coming from both. The reality is that the number one issue they are facing in the wealth and investment brokerage services revenue line is the decline in transactional revenue, and it has gone from two years ago probably $600 million a quarter -- even in not robust market times down to $300 million, $400 million in a quarter in net debt and that is part of the pay down for the annuity streams, even though they are having record net flows, it is just the pay, the revenue rate on that is less, and so that's the factor.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So, it is not to do with really recruiting, and the production per FA continues to be solid at 1 million plus. It is really that core fundamental issue that they\u2019re facing and that transition is overall gone through. It is getting to the point where it is becoming less material and, i.e. material to the total revenue line from the transaction side.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I would just remind everybody that we've got significant positive loan base in that business, and so again if rates rise, we are going to see some benefit there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">All right, thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">We\u2019ll move next to Steven Chubak of Nomura.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Hi, good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Good morning Steven.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So, I actually had a quick followup to the topic that Glen was just addressing relating to GWIM and just some of the margin pressures that we have been seeing over the last couple of quarters. I wanted to get a better sense as to how much of that do you think is cyclical versus secular, whether it be DOL related pressures or just intensifying competition for advisors, and along those same lines whether a 30% margin target is still achievable once we get to a more favorable rate backdrop?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Let me start with the last one and pick up on just some comments Brian made again. The decline in margin has been because of decline in transactional revenue. In addition, over the last couple of quarters, there has been a lot of market volatility. The markets have ended down in certain months, and that affects what we make on asset management. We were hoping a better market environment. We would see some improvement in some aspects of the transactional business because there is a lot of selling of mutual fund products and other products there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And then again, as I pointed out, we\u2019ve got a business here with close to $140 billion in loans and $240 billion, $260 billionish of deposits, and as rates move, we\u2019re going to start seeing some benefit from that with which the payout ratio is quite different than on the more traditional asset management products. So, that I really do think is the revenue story that will affect margins. And again, in the first quarter of this year, we\u2019re going to see $100 reduction in expenses because of the run off of compensation programs we put in place around the Merrill merger. So I think that's what I would say about margins. What was the second part of the question?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Can you just tell me about to what extent if you could at least segregate the secular versus cyclical headwind components on the revenue side, but I think that you adequately addressed that in your response.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yes, just I think people have to think about, Steven, the margin has come down, we think it\u2019s flooring out here and will start to pick back up in part because of some of the unfundamental changes in the ATP program running off and stuff, but we have invested in a PMD program, it cost a few hundred million dollars of drag to do that, that\u2019s the right thing to actually build advisor base over time to service the clients.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And the team; if you look at it underneath, the U.S. -- the flows and stuff are strong in the U.S. trust business. It is having some of its best quarters ever just because of the difference, and that it didn\u2019t have the secular run off you referred to in terms of the fee based business. So it\u2019s a good business, it does a good job to its clients. We expect more out of it and that is the job for John and Keith, and Andy and Terry to go forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thanks Brian. And maybe just switching over to the credit side, I appreciate the detailed disclosure you guys have given on the energy book, and we\u2019re just hoping you could provide both exposure and reserve levels maybe some area - other areas of the commodities complex, specifically metals and mining.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">We are - we feel good about our mills and mining exposure. It is about $8 billion, but most of that exposure is much more short dated and much more collateral, so we feel good about that exposure.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. And then just as a follow-up to the initial provision guidance you\u2019ve given, just thinking about it from a modeling perspective, is it the right way for us to be thinking about the provision rate for 2016 taking that $800 million to $900 million on quarterly run rate plus whatever additional energy driven reserve building we should be contemplating which presumably is incremental?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yes, that's not a bad way to think about it. Again remember our guidance from last quarter we said $800 million to $900 million for the first two quarters of 2016 and the way I will think about those two quarters would be, we'll see some lumpiness. But the one thing overall is that as you look at the question on the exposure that we\u2019re also paying close attention to is it sort of a demand or supply issue for oil prices, and if it\u2019s a supply issue that affects these companies and related companies demand and demand from, but if it is a demand in the broadest context, i.e., economies need to continue to slow down and that\u2019s the broader concern. </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So we\u2019re looking at not only the impacts in all the portfolios, thinking about who gets the benefits on our portfolio basis from low energy cost which are serious benefits to the consumers and companies that consume energy versus those producing it. And so, there is a balance here that we\u2019ve got to think through right now that\u2019s pretty isolated the energy companies, and even if you look at consumers who work for them in our basis by ZIP code and unemployment levels and stuff, we\u2019ve seen relatively modest deterioration in the consumer side before employing these businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So, I think as you are thinking about it, the real question is going to come down to you for 2016 in terms of all our industriesare we in a demand driven issue, i.e., general economic issue, is the United States going to plug along and if it does, then false guidance is the right one. If you are in the supply, it is going to all be localized on these industries.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio </span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yes, I mean if it is not demand, it\u2019s again worth emphasizing. There are a lot of people who are helped by low oil prices that helps our asset quality, not only on the consumer side but also in places like India and manufacturers all around the world.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. All right thanks guys, very helpful and thanks for taking my question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">We\u2019ll move next to Eric Wasserstrom of Guggenheim.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thanks very much. I was just wondering if you could help me think through a little bit your GAAP and risk weighted assets over the first half of the year given the growth dynamics that are pretty robust in some of the run-offs and then also some of the changes that are going through on the RWA calculations?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So you\u2019re talking about the first half of 2016?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Well on a standardized basis, I think you\u2019re going to see RWA trend up if we\u2019re able to grow deposits and loans. On an advanced basis, there\u2019s all sorts of puts and takes there. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see as much growth as you would on a standardized basis, on an advanced basis yes, as you were on a standardized basis as we continue to work on RWA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay. And so what are the -- kind of what are the implications of that then for your regulatory capital ratios?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio </span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Well we need to get to regulatory from a CET1 under an advanced basis. Our goal is to get to 10% plus or above by 2019. So we\u2019re at 9.8, I feel like we got the time to do that. We're certainly not going to need to take all that time. We would expect to get there soon, but it is impacted changes in rates, changes and OCI, we are returning, we are hopefully returning capital, but we\u2019re not - we feel like we\u2019re on track to get to 10% plus an appropriate buffer there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And the only other thing I would add is, we still have some opportunities to optimize RWA from an advanced perspective, that\u2019s in two fundamental areas. It\u2019s always tough. You can do in markets and other areas, but in two fundamental areas, one is the extra RWA we got on the wholesale side when we exited parallel run, that is not a permanent thing. We need to work on \u2013 work with our regulators and hopefully over time we can make some improvements there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">The other one is operational risk, we have $500 billion of RWA operations with some of the advanced approach. That is 25% more net higher to bank and that operational risk is for businesses that we are no longer in it with products we no longer sell, it\u2019s for a risk profile that we no longer tolerate. So again that will take time, but that is another opportunity for us to lower RWA through an advanced perspective.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Thanks and if I can just sneak in one more, and when you talk about an appropriate buffer are you thinking in method one or method two as a baseline?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I think a buffer to the capital, we\u2019re thinking we\u2019re basically thinking we need to be above the 10%, we would say 25 to 50 basis points would be where --</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Got it. Okay, thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">We will move next to the site of Ken Usdin of Jefferies.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ken Usdin</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Thanks good morning. Just a quick follow-up on the loan growth side, I know you talked about the credit quality underneath the commercial side, but after 13%, 14% loan growth a year, do you think you can maintain that type of pace of growth given some of the concerns we\u2019ve seen underlying even if quality is holding up? So just I guess your general outlook for loan growth rates and can it match or maintain what you did last year? Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Yes, look I\u2019m not sure we are in the business of giving guidance on loan growth. We think we can grow if we\u2019re looking for some perspective from us, I wouldn\u2019t even call it guidance, mid-single digit is what we hope we can accomplish.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ken Usdin</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay. Continue to be driven by commercial would you say?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I think it\u2019s going to be, continued to be driven by commercial, but you're going to see growth in consumers as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ken Usdin</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Yep, and just a quick second one, you\u2019ve been growing the mortgage business again, what is your outlook for continuing to take share in the mortgage business and kind of -- have we seen the bottoming of results on the fee side of mortgage?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Well, we are - in our mortgage business, I think we are focused on originating prime and sort of non-conforming loans. I would - there has been good progress, I think if you look over the last year, the number of non-conforming loans that we are originating has increased meaningfully. And I would remind you that those loans we booked on our balance sheet. So that\u2019s NBI when you\u2019re booking, when you\u2019re selling less loans, it is going to affect your NBI income, but it is going to come through [indiscernible] on a more annualized basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ken Usdin</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Absolutely.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">From a broader -- leave aside the fees because of the geography and how the accounting works and when you put 60%, 70% loans on balance sheet, in terms of overall production we expect to continue to make progress because you can see that numbers that we\u2019re going to \u2013 as other people are flattening out, we continue to have lots of opportunities with our core customers setting out and still that are creditworthy in our customer base, we are still getting to move it elsewhere and that is what the team is chipping away. And it is never going to be the hugest business of Bank of America compared to things like the Merrill Lynch business consumer, the credit card business in consumer, but we expect to get broader market share from each of the segments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yes, I think it is interesting, I am considering entirely this is directly 100% correlating we've done all the work, but we\u2019ve added sales professionals in our branches that are focused on originating mortgages that are more prime oriented. We\u2019ve got them working with our GWIM specialists. That client group is generally more prime oriented, and we see progress, we see the prime loans growing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ken Usdin</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">All right. Thanks guys.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">We\u2019ll move next to Brian Foran of Autonomous Research.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Foran</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Hi, good morning. I guess on commercial, if you could follow up on the ex-energy comments, in you experience what are some of the best leading indicators for the commercial credit cycle and what kind of trends have you seen, again ex-energy and those leading indicators over the past couple months that gives you confidence that thinks you\u2019re stable?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Well, I would think about that. We spend a lot of time. Our credit people do spend a lot of time just homing [ph] through that portfolio and looking at cash flows from the companies and making sure we understand the collateral, making sure we fully understand our structures, so I think it\u2019s just a lot of locking and tackling and talking to clients and making sure we understand what\u2019s going on with their businesses in terms of the energy portfolio. I would emphasize again that outside of the energy portfolio, we are not seeing movement in NPL and criticize in our assets. Our NPLs continue to come down.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Foran</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And then if I could ask a follow up along the same lines on the consumer side, I guess two parts, one you made the point that even in energy heavy geographies, you are not seeing any adverse change in the consumer? In parts specifically just since it is such a big credit line are early delinquencies still coming in better than expected or are they stable or how would you characterize the current early delinquency trends and then on home equity since again that\u2019s another big outsize portion of the reserve, is there any update you can give us on how the first wave of HELOC recasts or switches to amortization schedules have performed versus what you had modeled?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Sure, so in terms of the card, we look at our credit losses. They are at low points, historic low points, and they have been bumping around at that level. We\u2019ve seen a little bit of increase the last couple of quarters, but that again I think is just a reflection of things that's bumping around at really low levels.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">In terms of the home equity end of draw, based on the volume we\u2019ve seen to-date, which we've seen a lot of volume, the portfolio is performing in line with our expectations and we continue to monitor the end of draw portfolio and continue to work with our customers to manage the risk. And I just would remind everybody that these borrowers have paid through the downturn, and this portfolio continues to improve as home prices improve. The risk is an ongoing part of our reserve process and we think we\u2019re all reserved.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Foran</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Just on card, and yes it was 30 days, delinquency or 90, they came down during the course of -- from the end of '14, all the way through '15, and in both cases is running at multiple year lows in both percentage wise and nominal amounts, so we\u2019re seeing no deterioration of credit in either of those and the same with of the home equities. It is just in the home equities, we just have a little more clean up because of the legacy portfolio in there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">We\u2019ll move next to Brennan Hawken of UBS. Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Brennan?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And for your interruption we lost Mr. Hawken. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll move next to Mike Mayo of CLSA. Go ahead please.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Hi, I have one question for Paul, one for Brian. Paul, lower energy prices you said can help certain segments such as consumers. Can you give any examples of that and also on the energy topic, if oil stays at 30 then your provisions for energy would go up by how much, I didn\u2019t understand the answer from before?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Well, let me take the last one first, so we\u2019ve got a reserve on our energy portfolio of $500 million. That is 6% of those two filled factors that we can call high risk and we have done modeling, stress test modeling at various oil prices. The one we have been talking about on this call has been at $30, and that\u2019s over nine quarters, and so if oil stays at $30 for nine quarters, we would think that our losses over those nine quarters would be $700 million. Again that will go against the $500 we already have reserved, and one would presume we're building reserves during that time period to make up the difference.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">So Mike when you look at consumer benefits from the oil and gas, just to give you a simple thing, if you look at our card base in the fourth quarter of '15, the spending on debit, credit cards rose 4% from the fourth quarter of '14, and if gas prices would have been stable, they would have grown at 5.7%. And so what that means is consumers had effectively on that base of 1.7% to-date received the benefit of year-over-year. If you translate that to dollars, round numbers as $20 million a day is less spending on gasoline by our consumers in our portfolios per day.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And from like $90 million down to $70-ish million or something like that, that is the benefit they get, and so for a large number of consumers median income, the cash flow increases and that gives them more money to spend.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay, do you think people are being too negative on the decline in oil prices, you\u2019re implying it has a nice simulative effect, but people sure aren\u2019t taking that these days.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I think Mike, it comes down to a question whether you think this is a - the oil price is a reflection of a broader issue of growth in economies, we\u2019re going to get slow growth 2.5% in the U.S. and IMF [ph] said I guess 3.5% in the world. If you\u2019re going to get that in '16, it is going to be isolated. This negatives could be isolated, the oil companies and related commodity producers just because of slow growth environment. If you are saying this is going to be a much different economic scenario than most [indiscernible] so called consensus predicts. It\u2019s a broader based problem, but right now it's really an oversupply of oil driving prices down, and that\u2019s impacting the people in the industry and rest of the consumers, that means corporate customer and consumers that use oil and energy are getting a good benefit.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And again Mike, the only thing I would say is, I mean Brian is spot on, but the demand issue is kind of we are going to see it in other parts of the economy, however, we have not seen that yet, we have not seen change in our asset quality outside of energy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">And then if I can shift gears Brian, I know I have asked this question in other years, but I know you are not satisfied with the mid 60s core efficiency ratio, and I know you\u2019re not satisfied with a single-digit ROE. So what is your specific financial target for efficiency and ROE and what is your timeframe to get there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">As we said, we ran about 9%, it has just been travelling about 9.5% for the year and return to annual common equity. We believe we have a path to get that to 12. Rates get us part of it and hard work on expenses and core revenue growth and driving gets us the rest of it, and so LAS expense drop-in, and we're chipping away that, if you look from '14 to '15, we made substantial steps, and we will continue to drive away. We haven\u2019t put a specific timeframe on it. It\u2019s just a goal to keep driving, and we will drive beyond that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">On efficiency, it follows that - as an efficiency, it follows that sort of math. Right now, we are operating 66%, 67%, probably normalized for 2015 and between LAS we can drop that down to 65%, and that is just hard work and we\u2019re grinding away every day. You're seeing loans grow, you're seeing deposits grow, and so you should see improvement in 2016.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Any expense initiative plan Paul since you've had a couple of quarters now to take a look at that? Are we looking for like an extra billion or kind of like a new BAC program or what are you thinking about there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Expenses are on our mind every day at Bank of America. We have - everybody focuses on expense discipline that\u2019s translating to our culture under our simplified and improved program where the teams are always coming up with ideas to make it simpler for our customers, to make it simple for our employees, and improve the expenses of the company, that is how we\u2019re going to achieve our objectives around core expenses that we talked about on this call. We\u2019re all very focused on expenses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">All right. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">And it appears that we have no further questions at this time. I'd like to return the program back to our host for any concluding remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Thank you everyone. We look forward to talking to you next quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">This does conclude today's program.

[Operator Instructions] Please note this call is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. Lee McEntire. Please go ahead, sir.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Lee McEntire</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning. Thanks to everyone on the phone, as well as the webcast, for joining us this morning for the First Quarter 2016 Results. Hopefully everybody has had a chance to review the earnings release. The documents are available on our website. Before I turn the call over to Brian and Paul, let me remind you we may make some forward-looking statements. For further information on those, please refer to either our earnings release docs or our website or the SEC filings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Let me just remind you, please limit the number of questions so that we can get to everyone\u2019s \u2013 so we can get through all the questions that everyone has. And with that, I\u2019m pleased to now turn it over to Brian Moynihan, our Chairman, CEO, for some opening comments before Paul Donofrio, our CFO, goes through the details. Brian?</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you, Lee, and good morning to everyone. We want to thank you for joining us to review our first quarter results. Today we reported $2.7 billion in earnings this quarter, or $0.21 per diluted share. As you can see in the results, two large items impacted this quarter\u2019s results. We recorded negative market related NII adjustments for bond premium amortization. That adjustment alone cost us $0.07 per diluted share. And we also recorded a $0.05 per share diluted share cost of seasonal retirement eligible incentives.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">When you think about revenue, net interest income, excluding that bond premium adjustment, was $10.6 billion this quarter. This is improvement linked quarter and year-over-year. Our loans are growing across the franchise and, compared to the prior year, are up 11% in our business segments. In addition, deposit growth remains very strong. Our deposits were up $64 billion from last year or 6% to over $1.2 trillion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">This growth reflects our progress to grow responsibly and deepen relationships with all of our core customers. Moving to non-interest income, it declined year-over-year. Of note, the downdraft in that was driven by Capital Markets and related activities and, to a lesser degree, mortgage servicing and other fees as we continue to wind down our third-party servicing book.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">However, the other banking sources of non-interest income were relatively stable. Switching to costs we continue to drive costs down in this Company. Costs year-over-year in the first quarter were down 6%. FTEs were down 3%. That is $1 billion per quarter, $4 billion on an annualized basis. And if you focus just on the core costs excluding our LAS and litigation, those were down $600 million quarter \u2013 from first quarter of last year or $2.4 billion annualized. We\u2019re going to keep driving those costs own as we continue to move forward through 2016.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Turning to Slide 3 and looking at the business segment earnings, you can see the good year-over-year results because of the operating leverage in those businesses. The only exception is the results in Global Banking, which were negatively impacted by the increased energy related reserves. The combination of business segments outside the All Other group earned $4.5 billion in quarter one this year compared to $3.9 billion in quarter one of 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Offsetting those earnings were the $1.9 billion loss in All Other. That loss primarily reflects the two large adjustments I mentioned earlier and some legacy litigation costs. You can also see the returns and efficiency ratios for each of our segments and note, with the exception of LAS, which came close to breaking even this quarter, they earned above their cost of capital.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Moving to Slide 4, during the period of \u2013 during the first quarter, there was a lot of talk with the market volatility, the Company buying surrounding the question about global growth and the forward-looking economic picture. However, we don\u2019t see any evidence of our customer base changing. Spending by consumers remains strong and is up year-over-year over 4%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Loan demand remains solid throughout the franchise. And we continue to position our Company to face any potential economic outcome. When you think about this, it\u2019s important to remember the work we\u2019ve done over the past years to simplify and strengthen our foundation. We remain a different Company today than that which had entered the last downturn. We start with a clear strategy to serve the core financial needs of the customers. We\u2019ve gotten out of businesses, portfolios, products and client relationships that don\u2019t meet those strategic goals.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We simplified the Company in every area. We cut the number of legal entities in half and we also reduced costs through programs like New BAC that produced a loan more than $8 billion in annual savings and our SIM program which continues to operate today. At the same time we\u2019ve continued to invest in the areas we can grow. $3 billion in technology-related growth initiatives, especially in areas of digital practice, whether it\u2019s in Consumer Banking, Commercial Banking, where we lead the industry with mobile and online platforms.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We\u2019ve also invested more in client facing teammates, funding that investment through elimination of bureaucracy and simplification and elimination of management jobs. We believe that we have to continue to drive the productivity and will continue to do so in 2016. In the end, when you think about all this, it makes our Company more resolvable. As you all know, we received the latest input from our regulators on our resolution plans yesterday. Those plans were filed nine months ago and we\u2019ve been busy at work since the day they were filed to continue to remedy the deficiencies and shortcomings stated in those plans and we will do so by the October submission date.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">As you move to Slide 5 you can also see the financial foundation that we\u2019ve built in this Company. Liquidity and capital at record levels. Tangible book value per share, the marker of what we as shareholders own in our Company now stands at $16.17 and has improved over $5 a share over the last few years even as we\u2019ve taken the hits that are now largely behind us. Our funding structure continues to improve. Long-term debt has been cut dramatically; deposits have increased over 20% and most of that growth is coming through our Consumer Banking and Wealth Management segments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Our loan book is now well balanced, half consumer, half commercial. And importantly, the consumer piece is much more secured lending than it was before the last crisis. As we look in Global Markets, whether it\u2019s our Level 3 assets which are more risky, the total trading assets or VaR, they are all down significantly over the last few years. So as you can see we\u2019ve simplified our Company and our operating structure. As we look ahead to 2016, we remain focused on what we can control.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We intend to keep driving the core customer activity you see on the loan and deposit and customer flow growth in each and every business, focusing intently on the Wealth Management and Global Markets businesses to take advantage as markets have stabilized. We\u2019ll continue to drive on focusing on costs and drive those costs down and we\u2019ll continue to drive to deliver more capital to you as we did in the first quarter as investors.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">With that, let me hand it over to Paul.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"><strong>Paul Donofrio</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us. Starting on Slide 6, we present a summary of the income statement returns for this quarter, highlighting comparisons to Q4 2015 as well as Q1 2015. Earnings this quarter were $2.7 billion or $0.21 per share. These earnings include the negative impact of the FAS 91 market-related adjustment, which reduced EPS by $0.07. They also include $850 million of FAS 123 retirement eligible incentive expense, which reduced EPS by $0.05.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">For comparative purposes, the aggregate impact of these two same items in Q1 2015 reduced EPS by $0.08. Revenue on an FTE basis was $19.7 billion this quarter. Adjusted for FAS 91, revenue was $20.9 billion, a decline of $700 million from Q1 2015 on a similarly adjusted basis. This decline was driven by the reduction in sales and trading revenue and IB fees, as well as mortgage banking income offset by improvement in adjusted NII.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Expenses were $14.8 billion, approximately $1 billion or 6% lower than a year ago, driven by good discipline across the entire Company. Before moving to the balance sheet I want to note an adjustment to the financial statements this quarter, reclassifying some operating leases. We moved $6 billion of leases to other assets and we made conforming reclassifications to prior periods to improve comparability. This reclassification had no effect on net income.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">However, as a result of this reclassification, quarterly NII is lower by approximately $50 million, other income is higher by approximately $180 billion and depreciation expense is higher by about $130 million. While these changes are small and don\u2019t affect profits, I wanted to note them so that you can more easily adjust your models.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to Slide 7 and the balance sheet in the balance sheet. Total assets increased $41 billion from Q4 driven by higher Global Markets repo activity as well as increased cash. Deposits rose $20 billion from Q4 while loans increased $4 billion. Driven by deposit inflows, liquidity rose to $525 billion. Time to required funding, while down, remains strong at three years. And note that the first quarter included the $8.5 billion settlement payment to Bank of New York Mellon as trustee in the article 77 suit, which was reserved for over four years ago.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Tangible common equity of $167 billion improved $4.7 billion from Q4. On a per share basis, tangible book value increased to $16.17, up 9% from Q1 2015. Turning to regulatory metrics: as a reminder, we report regulatory capital under the advanced approaches. Our CET1 transition ratio under Basel III ended the quarter at 10.3% and really is only comparable to Q4 as prior periods were reported under the standardized approach prior to our exit from parallel run.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On a fully phased-in basis, CET1 capital improved $3.4 billion to $158 billion as improvements from earnings and OCI were partially offset by dividends and repurchases. Under the advanced approaches, compared to Q4 2015, the CET1 ratio increased 30 basis points to 10.1% and is now above our fully phased-in 2019 requirement. RWA decreased roughly $18 billion driven by reductions related to retail exposures as credit quality improved.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We also provide our capital metrics under the standardized approach. Here our CET1 ratio improved to 11% with the same capital improvement as advanced but less of an RWA improvement given standardized is less risk sensitive. Supplemental leverage ratios for both the Parent and the Bank continue to exceed U.S. regulatory minimums that take effect in 2018.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to Slide 8, we had solid loan and deposit growth in the quarter. Reported loans of $901 billion on an end of period basis increased $4 billion from Q4 and are up $28 billion or 3% from Q1 2015. Loans in our primary lending segments were up $14 billion or 2% from Q4 which is 8% on an annualized basis. We continued to see solid commercial loan growth in Global Banking. In Consumer Banking we continue to see strong growth in consumer real estate and vehicle lending.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Lastly, in Wealth Management we also saw continued growth in consumer real estate. Loans outside the primary lending segments in LAS and All Other were down $10 billion from Q4 driven by continued pay downs of first and second lien mortgages as well as loan sales. During the quarter, we sold FHA loans totaling $2.7 billion and NPLs and other delinquent loans of roughly $1 billion, recording a small gain on sales and other income.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to deposits, on an ending basis they reached $1.2 trillion this quarter, growing $64 billion or 6% from Q1 2015. Growth was led by our consumer businesses. Consumer Banking grew $43 billion or 8% year-over-year. GWIM grew nearly $17 billion, a 7% pace, and Global Banking grew at a 3% pace.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to asset quality on Slide 9. Outside the energy sector, credit quality is strong. Total net charge-offs were $1.1 billion in Q1 and Q4. We had some immaterial movements this quarter from minor adjustments but overall very little change in consumer losses. Commercial losses declined slightly from Q4 despite a slight increase in energy charge-offs. Provision of $1 billion in Q1 was up $187 million from Q4. While net charge-offs were flat, total reserve release declined as reserve releases in Consumer were mostly offset by reserve increases in commercial driven by energy exposures.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On slide 10, we provide credit quality data on our Consumer portfolio. Net charge-offs declined $41 million from Q4. Consumer real estate charge-offs benefited from continued portfolio improvement and fewer one time items, primarily collateral valuation adjustments on consumer real estate. Adjusting for those items, consumer net charge-offs were relatively flat versus Q4. Delinquency levels and NPLs improved and reserve coverage remains strong.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Moving to commercial credit on Slide 11, net charge-offs improved $35 million. A decline in non-energy net charge-offs from Q4 more than offset a modest increase in energy losses. Energy charge-offs increased $17 million from Q4 to roughly $100 million in the quarter. Given that asset quality outside energy remains relatively stable, let\u2019s focus on energy. We continue to support our energy clients while managing limits and actively engaging with stressed borrowers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Our overall committed energy exposures declined slightly from Q4 while utilized exposures were up by $500 million. As discussed last quarter, within energy, we believe two subsectors, refining and marketing, as well as vertically integrated, which by the way tend to be large market cap and/or sovereign supported. These two subsectors are less dependent on oil prices and therefore carry less risk than our exposures in E&amp;P and oilfield services.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Looking at our $7.7 billion utilized exposure to the higher risk E&amp;P and oilfield services clients, we saw a decline of $600 million from Q4 as payoffs and charge-offs more than offset draw downs. In addition, this quarter we moved $1.6 billion of our energy exposure to reservable criticized, and we added $525 million to our energy reserves. We made these adjustments based upon another quarter of not only low oil prices but also volatile prices.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">This moves our energy reserve to just over $1 billion. And while these reserves cover also energy portfolio, they would represent 13% of our $7.7 billion E&amp;P and oilfield services exposures. We believe that percentage is probably more relevant as you compare exposures across the industry.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to Slide 12, net interest income on an FTE basis was $9.4. Included in NII this quarter was a FAS 91 negative $1.2 billion market-related adjustment for bond premium amortization. This adjustment in Q1 2015 was a negative $500 million. And including TruPS-related charges, Q4 was also negative $500 million. Adjusted NII of $10.6 billion improved approximately $500 million compared to Q1 2015, excluding FAS 91, and improved $100 million from Q4 after also excluding the TruPS charge.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Several factors contributed to the improvement from Q4. We had good commercial loan growth funded by deposits. We also had about $100 million in seasonal benefits in Q1. Offsetting these factors we had one last day of interest and lower dividends on our Federal Reserve stock as required to contribute to the Highway Trust Fund. Lower long-term rates also offset some of the benefits of the Fed rate hike in December pressuring NII.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Lower long-term rates was also the driver of increased asset sensitivity in the quarter. As of 3/31, and instantaneous 100 basis point parallel increase in rates is estimated to increase NII by approximately $6 billion over the subsequent year. About 40% of this estimated $6 billion increase comes from short end rate improvement and the rest is from long end rate improvement split equally between FAS 91 and reinvestment at higher rates.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Turning to Slide 13, non-interest expense was $14.8 billion in the quarter. That is $1 billion or 6% lower than Q1 2015 driven by good expense discipline across the Company. Legacy asset costs excluding litigation \u2013 excuse me, Legacy Assets Servicing costs excluding litigation were $729 million this quarter, declining $292 million from Q1 2015 and $64 million from Q4.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Litigation expense of $388 million was in line with Q1 2015 as we work to resolve remaining legacy issues. First quarter expense also included FAS 123 annual retirement costs of $850 million, slightly below Q1 2015. First quarter of both years also included about $300 million of seasonally elevated payroll tax expense. Adjusting for all these items, i.e. the litigation, LAS, FAS 123 and the elevated payroll tax, expenses were $12.5 billion. This decline of $600 million from Q1 2015 was driven by: lower revenue-related costs associated with sales and trading in investment banking, as well as revenue in our Wealth Management business; the roll off of advisory retention awards put in place after the combination with Merrill Lynch; and lastly, SIM initiatives that are improving productivity and helping us lower costs so that we can continue to invest in growth.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Our employee base is down 3% from Q1 2015 and increases in client facing professionals were more than offset by reductions in LAS and other operations staff. Lastly before leaving expense highlights I want to remind you that quarterly FDIC insurance expense is set to increase at the large banks until the deposit insurance fund reaches 1.35%. For us, this will increase expense by approximately $100 million pretax starting in Q3 2016.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Okay, turning to the business segments, starting with Consumer Banking on Slide 14. Consumer earned $1.8 billion, 22% better than Q1 last year. These earnings reflect continued core customer growth coupled with strong expense management. Lower provision expense from continued improvement in asset quality also benefited the bottom line. This work generated a strong 24% return on allocated capital. Note that allocated capital increased slightly for 2016 pursuant to our normal capital allocation reviews completed in Q1.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On Slide 15 we focus on some important trends. First, in the upper left, we continue to lead the industry in a number of ways, as you can see from the stats. Revenue increased $242 million or 3% from Q1 2015 as NII growth more than offset lower non-interest income. Net interest income benefited from higher client balances. Non-interest income was down due to lower mortgage banking income offset by increases in card income and service charges. We continue to see mortgage banking income come down given our strategy to book more of our originations on the balance sheet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Expenses declined 2% from Q1 2015. On the bottom left, you can see the year-over-year decline in FTEs as Mobile Banking growth continues to help us optimize our delivery network. Note, while overall FTEs are down year-over-year, sales specialists are up almost 900 from Q1 2015. Lastly, our deposit franchise continues to drive operating leverage. Our cost of deposits as a percent of average deposits continues to improve and now stands at 171 basis points which we believe is best-in-class in the industry.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Focusing on Mobile Banking users in the upper right for a minute, we added 910,000 net new mobile users this quarter. We now have nearly 20 million active users and deposit transactions from mobile devices now represents 16% of deposit transactions. Interestingly, this quarter we added more net new users than any quarter in the last three years and we continue to add new features and capabilities, improving convenience and satisfaction. One way we are promoting adoption is by deploying digital ambassadors in our financial centers. Digital ambassadors engage with customers who come to our branches to transact. They educate these customers on alternatives to branch banking which are not only more convenient for them but also less expensive for us. Digital sales, digital appointments, digital satisfaction all continue to achieve new highs. Focusing on client balances, you can see Merrill Edge brokerage assets are up 7% from Q1 2015 on strong flows offset by lower valuations. Moving to the bottom right of the page, note that loans were up 8% in Q1 2015 on strong, mortgage and auto growth.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay, moving to Slide 16, this is a new page that presents some statistics around loan growth and the quality of originations in our Consumer segment. Starting with card we issued 1.2 million cards in the quarter, which is a bit lower than the past few quarters. Average balances were impacted by the sale of a $1.7 billion non-strategic card portfolio late in Q4. Adjusting for that divestiture, loans were up from Q4. Spending on credit card, adjusted for divestitures, was up 8% compared to Q1 2015. As we\u2019ve discussed many times and shown here, we are originating high FICO loans that have produced very low loss rates and strong risk-adjusted margins currently exceeding 9%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Moving to vehicle lending, one sees similar high-quality, low risk lending stats. Average book FICOs are around 780 and loss rates are low. Also, the tenor of these loans is relatively conservative compared to the industry as nearly 90% of our loans are less than 73 months. Margins obviously aren\u2019t as high as credit card, but average balances are growing well across multiple channels within the business. Our underwriting standards are producing similar results in consumer real estate lending which is presented on the bottom of the page. Net loss rates on first lien mortgages have been negligible. Remember, we began booking these loans in the Consumer segment in the first quarter of 2014 and the macro consumer environment has been healthy, particularly for high FICO borrowers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Turning to Slide 17, Global Wealth &amp; Investment Management produced earnings of $740 million, up 13% from Q1 2015. Year-over-year revenue was down but expenses declined more, pretax margin to 26%. Overall, revenue declined 2% from Q1 2015 as strong NII growth was more than offset by lower market sensitive revenue. Asset management revenue declined on lower market values. Transactional revenue was also down and continues to be impacted by the shifting of activity from brokerage to managed relationships as well as market uncertainty. NII benefited from solid deposit and loan growth.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Non-interest expense in the first quarter of 2016 benefited from the fully amortized advisory retention awards given at the time of the Merrill Lynch merger. We have not seen a noticeable attrition as a result of this. Lower revenue-related incentives also contributed to lower expense versus Q1 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Moving to Slide 18, despite lower market levels, we continued to see overall solid client engagement and we continue to invest in the business, growing client facing professionals year-over-year. Client balances are $2.5 trillion. Long-term AUM flows were down this quarter as a result of market volatility which impacted client behavior. Average deposits grew $9 billion from Q4 and average loans also grew this quarter concentrated in consumer real estate lending.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Turning to Slide 19, Global Banking earned $1.1 billion, down from both comparative periods as energy reserves weighed on results. Despite this increased provision expense, Global Banking was able to deliver a 12% return on allocated capital. And note that we allocated $2 billion more in capital to Global Banking for 2016, pursuant to our annual evaluation of allocated capital. Global Banking continues to drive solid loan growth within its risk and client frameworks and this drove a nice increase year-over-year in NII, mitigated to some degree by spread compression. That NII improvement, combined with revenue growth from credit cards and treasury fees, partially offset a decline in investment banking and other marks on loans and hedges. Noninterest expense, compared to Q1 2015, reflects a decline in revenue-related expense offset by the cost of adding sales professionals over the past 12 months.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Looking at trends on Slide 20 and comparing to Q1 last year, it was obviously a tough quarter for the capital markets with spikes in volatility causing declines in client activity. However, clients still have financing needs and here is where the diversity and strength of our franchise allows us to continue to deliver for them even when capital markets are less attractive. You can see that trend in our average loans and lease balances, which increased again this quarter and are up 14% year-over-year. Growth in loans was broad-based across C&amp;I, CRE and leasing, although recently we have slow growth in CRE.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Spread compression on average across all our customer sizes has moderated relative to a year ago. Average deposits also increased from Q1 2015, up $11 billion or 4%. We remain focused on our deposit mix which is strong with only 3% classified as 100% runoff balances. On the other hand, total firm-wide IB fees of $1.2 billion were down 22% from Q1 2015 with declines broad-based across M&amp;A, DCM and ECM.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Switching to Global Markets on Slide 21 and comparing Q1 last year, again the challenging market condition caused revenue compared to Q1 2015 to be down. The quarter included a benefit from the resolution of a litigation matter and we also had lower revenue-related costs compared to Q1 2015. All of this resulted in Global Markets reporting earnings just under $1 billion. Reported revenue was down year-over-year, but note that last year DVA negatively impacted revenue versus added to revenue this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Total revenue, excluding DVA, while up from Q4, was down 17% from Q1 last year on lower sales and trading revenue as well as Global Markets share of lower IB fees. Non-interest expense declined 23% from Q1 2015 driven by lower litigation. Adjusting for litigation, expenses were down 9% as a result of lower revenue-related expenses demonstrating a disciplined approach to compensation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Moving to trends on the next slide and focusing on the components of our sales and trading performance, sales and trading revenue of $13.3 billion excluding net DVA is up 25% from Q4 with improvement in both FICC and equity, but down 16% from Q1 last year. Versus Q1 2015, FICC sales and trading up $2.3 billion fell 17% reflecting a tough environment for credit-related products as well as a tough comparison to a strong Q1 2015 in currencies. Equity trading was $1 billion, declining 11% reflecting weaker trading performance in a challenging market environment. Average trading assets continued to trend down as did VaR which remains at historically low levels.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Turning to Legacy Assets &amp; Servicing on Slide 23. This segment lost $40 million this quarter. I\u2019m not going to spend a lot of time here as trends are consistent with past quarters. Revenue was down a bit from lower servicing fees as the portfolio of service loans declines. Revenue was also impacted by lower net hedge results. As the portfolio shrinks, we continue to lower servicing costs particularly with respect to delinquent loans. The number of 60 plus day delinquent first mortgage loans serviced continue to decline and is now only 88,000 units. Excluding litigation expense this quarter was $729 million, dropping nearly $300 million from Q1 2015 and down $64 million from Q4.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">On Slide 24 we show All Other which reported a loss of $1.9 billion. Results were impacted by the $1.2 billion FAS 91 market-related adjustment, the FAS 123 seasonal retirement eligible incentive costs and litigation costs. The loss here is higher than Q1 2015 for a number of reasons. First, the market-related adjustment is more negative this year than last. Second, we had higher gains on sales of loans in Q1 2015 than this period. Third, provision expense is higher as both periods had a benefit from provision but this quarter that benefit was smaller than Q1 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Lastly, litigation costs were higher this quarter versus Q1 2015 as we worked down legacy issues. The effective tax rate for the quarter was about 28%, which is better than we expect for the full year absent any unusual items. One expected item that we want to bring to your attention is another UK tax rate reduction recently proposed in the Chancellor\u2019s budget. We expect this to be signed into law in Q3 and will result in a tax charge of about $350 million to reduce the carrying value of our UK DTA. The vast majority of this charge will not impact regulatory capital.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay, so let me offer a few takeaways as I finish. Given the market volatility, revenue growth was challenging this quarter. However, we compensated for this by managing expenses well. If one adjusts this period\u2019s reported results for the noncash FAS 91 market-related NII amount and the FAS 123 costs, earnings are largely in line with recent quarters. You can see progress most clearly in our business segments which don\u2019t include these adjustments. Taken as a whole, the segments, not including All Other, improved earnings by 16% versus Q1 2015. The drivers of this improvement were solid loan and deposit growth across our customer groups. Net charge-offs were largely unchanged as modest increases in energy were mitigated by other improvements.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">We strengthened our capital liquidity and we returned $1.5 billion in common dividends repurchased to shareholders. To Brian\u2019s earlier point, we have done years of work to simplify the Company and reduce risk. With $167 billion in tangible common equity, $12 billion in credit reserves and twice the amount of liquidity of a few years ago, we believe we are well prepared to help customers and clients in good and bad times and we are focused on growing earnings in many different economic scenarios.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">With that, let\u2019s open it up to Q&amp;A.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p8\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">[Operator Instructions] We can take our first question from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hey, good morning. Just maybe let\u2019s focus \u2013 I\u2019ll focus my question on expenses and then I\u2019ll get back in the queue. But I think outside of incentive comp expenses generally were better than I was expecting and how much of that is to simplify and improve and how much more do you think there is to do on some of these core expenses I guess is number one?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Look about from Q4 to Q1, $300 million in core expense decline. $100 million of that is the roll off of the amortization of the awards we gave to advisors around the Merrill Lynch acquisition. $200 million of it is just good, solid expense discipline being driven by SIM and other initiatives. If you look at the supplement you\u2019re going to see expenses came down in nearly every category.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And you think there\u2019s more to do there? I guess maybe in the context of your discussion around digitization and Consumer, that seems like that could be a longer-term tailwind. Do you guys agree? And do you think that\u2019s a material mover or just more incremental?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Jim, I think there\u2019s a lot more to do here because at the end of the day adjusting the efficiency ratio for the two major adjustments, which won\u2019t reoccur next quarter, you get in the mid-60 \u2013 66, 67 and we need to drive that down in the low 60s even with the realities of the wealth management business not being as profitable and a big part of our revenue stream but very return on capital beneficial. So then if you flip and say how are we going to get down there? You\u2019re exactly right. If you look, we drifted down even further this quarter. Numbers of branches, smaller numbers of customers, but deposits are up. If you look at headcount in Consumer we continue to reposition it towards the sales and relationship management side and away from the transactional side.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And so that digitization, which is \u2013 we\u2019re at $19.6 million, Mobile Banking consumer customers. And interesting enough we\u2019re growing on the online customer base, meaning computer-based customers grew over 1 million customers from last year\u2019s first quarter. So all that just drives more and more transactions, more and more cost structure of the day-to-day transactional stuff into those environments and saves us money overall. And at 170 basis points, there was a time when that was 300 basis points five, six, seven years ago. We thought we\u2019d got it into the low 2s \u2013 220, 240, and thought that was pretty good and now we\u2019re at 170, and my guess is we continue to push it down.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">That\u2019s helpful. And maybe just one ticky tack question on the FDIC charge. It wasn\u2019t clear. Is that an annual expense or is that going to be quarterly at $100 million?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">It\u2019s going to be quarterly $100 million beginning in Q3 until the fund gets up to its adequate level and then it will come down.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay, all right. Great. Thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Our next question comes from Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Any outlook you can provide in terms of the potential for additional reserve boosts related to energy? We heard one bank yesterday talk about maybe another $500 million, although a lot of variability around that number they pointed to. And obviously their book is different than yours, but any thoughts if conditions stay where they are now on additional reserve boosts? And then just related to that, the outlook for additional reserve release in the rest of the portfolio given, as you mentioned, trends continue to be strong or even improve in some areas.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Sure. Look, in terms of reserve build, we think the reserves we have right now are the right reserves for our portfolio. Built in releases in the future of going to be based upon how companies adapt to the level and duration of low oil prices as well as our net charge-offs and we think companies are adapting. In terms of reserve releases, we would expect releases in Consumer, but at a slower pace than we've seen in the past as we run off the legacy portfolio and depended upon the real estate market.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Consumer releases would likely go to offset any builds in commercial.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. That's helpful. And then just separately, kind of big picture from a regulatory point of view if I look back to last year, you've had some steps forward, some steps backwards. Obviously had to resubmit on CCAR and that was a net positive once you got the results back. You got the approval for the extra 1% buyback which I think symbolically a lot of investors view and I view as positive. You've got the living will issue that came up yesterday for you and a number of others. Just at a very high level, maybe give us an update on how you are feeling from the regulatory point of view and where the areas are that you feel like you still need to improve.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I think from a global perspective we continue to implement all the rules and regulations of change over the last few years. And importantly, Volcker was an implementation mid-this year. And all lot of the hard work has been done if you think about LCR, SLR, the core Basel rules and the changes. We absorbed the advanced increases over the last year and now we're above the 10% advanced including the $100 billion or more of RWA for the commercial assets and the off risk of capital of $40- billion-odd. And so, we've absorbed a lot of that into the run rate and I think we're now to the point of fine-tuning the Company around the rules and regulations and continue optimizing it. And I think that \u2013 we've obviously submitted the CCAR work.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We did a tremendous amount of work just on the expense submitted the CCAR work. We did a tremendous amount of work just on the expense side. That was another $40 million of incremental expense this quarter in the first quarter to continue to get us using third parties to continue to make sure we kept our run rate at best-in-class. And so that's in and being reviewed as we speak. And then we've got obviously, as you spoke about, the continuation of finishing up the resolution plan, which we \u2013 has probably spent at least $0.5 billion on external parties to help us with and a lot of internal work. And that's all been in the run rate as we speak and ultimately provide relief as we get through it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So I think overall you've seen us implement most of the rules and optimize the Company. We need to continue to do that. That ought to provide some RWA opportunities in the future, but it continues to take time. But we've \u2013 I think we're in pretty good shape and now the question is just to finish up a couple of these key tasks on the resolution plan that you can see. Unprecedented transparency \u2013 you've got the same letter I got, so you know exactly what we have to do, and we'll get it done.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">If I could just have maybe two thoughts. One, this is not an episodic activity for us. This is being [Audio Dip] and meeting the standards under the regulations. That's one. Two is it's not a group of people who are doing this. It's everybody in the Company. It's \u2013 we have a significant \u2013 it's really being led in many ways by the line of business. We've got involvement from all of the support functions, so it's become part of the culture of the Company to get to the right standards across all the regulations.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And we can take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Hey, good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Good morning, Betsy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Good morning, Betsy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Hey, couple of questions. One is on the quality of the book. You went through and reminded us how much you've improved the quality of book in the Consumer. Could you speak to that in the commercial as well, ex-energy? And then give us a sense as to whether or not you think that's embedded in the CCAR results. I'm just trying to get an understanding of whether or not you think that RWA hit that you had to take could potentially come down as commercial rolls through?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So outside of \u2013 on the commercial side, outside of energy and metals and mining, we don't see issues with credit quality. We're obviously watching very carefully, but it feels very good outside of those two sectors. What was the second part of your question?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Its on the CCAR results.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Oh, yes, yes, absolutely. Look, if you look at our CCAR results, either on an absolute basis or on a comparative basis, you can see what a third-party, the Fed, thinks our losses would be. You're going to see that again in a few months. And I think you can really see, when you look at those results, how much we've improved the credit quality of Company of both \u2013 across both Consumer and Commercial.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Do you think that can help in the buyback ask as you go through \u2013 it's not just a question about this year but just over time?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Over time, Betsy, our view is that we can grow the Company and grow it responsibly as we talk about. So there's opportunities for growth and that's \u2013 on the Consumer segment a lot of questions we get is how can you grow and keep your credit discipline? You must be changing. You can see that this stuff coming on today is as strong as anything we put on and the Commercial you should assume is the same. And so there is still plenty of opportunity for us to grow, which is just good for earnings and prospects. When you flip it to the other side of it, yes, our job from the management team was to set this Company up to \u2013 it would never have the kind of risk embedded in it that would lead us to difficult times and a real recession, leave alone the CCAR analysis. And as you see the CCAR analysis over time, you see our loss content continue to come down and that should serve us in good stead to be able to take out capital over time, as you said. And if you think about in the Commercial book, it's \u2013 things like commercial real estate, we have been very disciplined and what we inherited through all the deals and development loans \u2013 all that stuff is really nonexistent at any consequence, so we feel very good about the Commercial book.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay, and then just separately, you talked a bit about the mobile user increase. And I just wanted to get your sense as to the opportunity from here. You recently launched the new app with mobile pay, which you've been doing internally but now you can do externally.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Right.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Could you give us how that's resonating with clients? Is there an opportunity set here for you and are you going to market it a little bit more aggressively going forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So let's \u2013 just framing from the overall top. Last year this quarter we had 17 million mobile users; this year we have 19.5 million. And as Paul said, there was an interesting point that the nominal rate of growth this quarter was one of the highest we've ever had. So even though smart phones have penetrated, you think you've kind of penetrated the customer base, it's still growing fast, so that's number one. And then as I said earlier, Betsy, and you've followed our Company for a long time, you might \u2013 you would've seen a plateauing in the online \u2013 the computer-based banking, for lack of a better term, people coming in through BankofAmerica.com. And that now is growing as fast nominally or faster mobile which means people are also using both sides. And so that's one thing. So the core activity is growing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And if you look at the activity in the core customer base from card usage \u2013 both that in credit card usage up 4%-plus year-over-year, and that's good. The online mobile part of the spend is now up to 20% of the spend and it's growing 15% per year versus the 4%, 4.5% growth on the total. So that's tremendous. Then if you get in the wallet categories, just to give you a sense, just in the last week the growth rates in enrolled cards was 12% week to week growth in terms of volume enrolled, 100,000-odd cards came on. The payment usage was up 3% week over week, so you see this phenomenal growth rate. If you annualized that out, that's a weekly growth rate and it ebbs and flows with holidays and everything else, but think about that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And you see that usage going up, but the mobile wallet payments are still less than 0.2% of the total payments made with plastic at Bank of America. So you still have lots of opportunity to convert activity to a platform which is more convenient for the customer. And then the other thing we've \u2013 and then a part of that you talk about is the new consortium to build a new P2P deployment for the banking system. We're up and operating that. We still have a few more months before the rest of the colleagues in the consortium get up and then we'll start to push that out in the market heavily. I think it's a tremendous improvement over what we have today, even though we have a fair amount of volume on it today through clearXchange and that was an effort to get us all together so we could have a very interoperable payment network.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">We've got the Visa Checkout work that's going on where we're preloading customers' cards in their wallet. We're about, as best we can tell, 13%, 14% of all the spend in Visa Checkout today and we've got 1 million-plus cards; we'll drive that forward. And if you put that altogether you're seeing tremendous volume off of all these mechanisms. And in the month of March, to give you an example, we had almost $60 billion of payments off the computer-based platform and about $20 billion off the mobile-based platform. So think about the size of that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Now given all that, we still sent out about $8 billion of cash out of our ATMs in the month of March on \u2013 that's $0.25 billion a day or more. So it's still \u2013 you have to have all the capabilities and that's what we're building towards. And going back to I think Jim's question earlier, the cost structure keeps moving in your favor as you keep driving this activity through.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I mean eventually you've got an elimination of checks and some of your bill pay costs potentially go down as well, I would assume?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes, eventually is always an operative word. Even today I think there's about a quarter million checks a day, people take a picture of them and send them in on their mobile phones and that didn't exist three years ago. But there's still a quarter million of them that would have to go way, so it will be a while.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay, but that's in line with expectations to bring down the consumer expense ratio? I mean, is that really the driver of getting the consumer expense ratio down is the backend on the payments piece?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes, it's everything about payments: processing, fraud losses, discussions with the customers about the payment \u2013 the multiple payment faculties that they could use and how they interface. And so, it has been a huge driver. Remember we went from 6,100 branches down to 4,600 or whatever today. And the customer base has increased by 10% and the volume of deposits is up by I think 30% to 40% and checking deposits are up dramatically. So I think year-over-year checking deposits were up 8% or 10% I think, Lee, right? Something like that. So the activity is level is growing up on a smaller and smaller base. And that cost structure in retail is driven by two things, the people, which we're increasing sales in relationship management content, and the physical plant.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And you're absolutely right, driving all that out \u2013 near as we can tell, we spend about $1 billion a year just moving cash around in our company. So less cash moving around saves us money.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. And just remind us what your goal is to get the consumer expense ratio to?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">The goal is to have it keep going down every day, week, month, quarter. And I think, Betsy, with all these things you've got to be careful about letting my consumer colleagues think they are doing too good a job. So I keep putting pressure on them, so I'm not going to give them a goal that they think they've achieved something.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">All right. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Our next question comes from John McDonald with Berstein.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Hi, good morning. I was wondering about \u2013 on the net interest income side if you could talk a little bit about, Paul, what kind of outlook we should think about for the core net interest income. That was 10.6 this quarter. If rates are relatively stable and we don't see any hike for a while, how should that trend with all the puts and takes?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Sure. So look, we're hesitant to give guidance. Given the volatility rate that we've experienced, guidance has not been that helpful, in my opinion, but I'll give you a couple of thoughts, 10.6, if you think about maybe as a launching off point, given some of the seasonal NII gains we had in Q1 I think a more reasonable launch point would be more like 10.5. Then you go to the second quarter, we've obviously got to deal with lower long-term rates. Second quarter is always a little bit seasonally lower for us. So there's some \u2013 progress there is going to be challenged. But I think as you head to the third quarter and fourth quarter, when you consider what we're \u2013 think we can do on deposit growth and loan growth, and if rates follow the path along the forward curve, we would expect to make progress in the latter half of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay, and you do get a day count help modest in the second quarter from the first, right? Doesn't that help?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">It's a leap year, so I think it's normally down 2, but now it's down 1, or\u2026</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Kind of maybe right.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Flat, yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Going into the second. Okay. And then just on trading, there was a quote in the media from you this morning, Paul, saying March felt better in certain areas. Could you just give us a little color on what changed in March on the trading front? What got better? Has that carried over a little bit into April? And how are you thinking about the Brexit vote from a risk and revenue impact potentially as that comes up this spring?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Sure. So March felt, I think, a lot better than certainly January and February. And April it's really too early, but April feels, at least is starting out, like it's more like March than it is like January and February. In terms of Brexit, we are focused on our clients and customers. They are going to need \u2013 there's going to be volatility potentially around the vote and around any changes after the vote. And we're working very closely with our customers to address how they need to manage their risk.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">From our own Company perspective, we are \u2013 we're going to listen. It's a UK \u2013 it's the UK's decision. We're going to \u2013 after we find out what the decision is and understand it, then I think we will react to it and do what we think is in the best interest of our customers and clients and shareholders and other constituencies.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay, thank you. And in terms of March, what \u2013 could you just \u2013 any color on what got better? What felt better? Which areas of the business? Could you help on that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">No, I wouldn't say \u2013 look, I think you heard from competitors that Asia was a little better in March. We're stronger in the U.S. than we are in Asia. We have a significant business there, but \u2013 so there was some improvement out there. But, no, I wouldn't have any more specifics than that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay, thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Our next question will come from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Hi, thanks very much. On slide 12 you noted your asset sensitivity increased a bunch from the prior quarter. You mentioned driven by the drop in long end rates. Could you talk through how that actually works. And then how much of the $6 billion is short end versus long end?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Sure. 40% of the $6 billion is going to come from an increase in short end rates and then the other 60% is split equally between FAS 91 and reinvestment at longer term rates. The FAS 91 piece is relatively straightforward. I mean we had $1.2 billion decline in Q1 because interest rates went down 50 basis points. We\u2019re going to retrace that if they go back up.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Separate one. If you look at the ROA full year-on-year, it's a large amount on a percentage basis from 59% down to 50%. I'm just curious, I wouldn't think weak capital markets in the quarter was the big driver, but I guess the question is what's the big driver of it. And are the new business you are putting on coming in at higher ROA so we should expect that to rise from here, assuming not so crazy markets?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Look, if you think about our ROA and you adjust for FAS 91 market-related NII adjustments and retirement-eligible expenses, you're going to get into the mid-70s. And then if you give us some credit for the progress we've made in LAS over the last few years and continue with that progress, you're going to get even higher. From there it's about growing loans \u2013 growing deposits, growing loans, putting on, like you said, assets that are accretive to what we have on the books right now. And, importantly, continuing to grind and work on expenses. And so, that's what we've got to do.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. One last tiny one is Wealth Management margins increased a couple hundred basis points quarter-on-quarter. 500 year-on-year without the help of revenues. Expenses were down a bunch. You mentioned the $100 million roll off of the previous amortized retention awards. What's the rest of the expense saves inside Wealth Management? It's pretty good in a world that didn't have much revenue.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">It's compensation related given the fact that revenue was a little weak because of the volatile markets. That's not to say we're not working on bringing down costs in that segment as well, but specifically to answer your question in Q1, that's what drove it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Is that nonproduction expenses, meaning usually the comp stuff goes hand-in-hand with revenues?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yes, it's \u2013 they are working on all the elements expense, so you've got that right. But also remember as the NII increases there's not as much expense attached to that. So that's one of the operating leverage points in wealth management that we were losing a lot last year that we're going to get back as short-term rates rise because they are a heavy deposit business. Remember, they alone are $260 billion of deposits in Wealth Management, which those deposits and loans continue to grow which continues to produce more core NII. As well as what everybody thinks of as being a large Investment Management trust fee type company. But they are a big bank and the loans grow and that's going to drive that up and that is marginally more profitable for the shareholder.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay, perfect. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Our next question comes from Paul Miller with FBR &amp; Company.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Paul Miller</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Hey, thank you very much, guys. On the legacy asset, on the \u2013 you lowered your loans from 103,000 to 88,000 on the high touch servicing or default servicing. How much of that was sold or are you guys just working through the book?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I would classify it as little to very little sold this quarter. It's just working service loans \u2013 delinquent service loans down.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Paul Miller</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Just working it down? And has \u2013 the new stuff coming in, is that still a material amount or it has that been \u2013 is that mainly done? Like you're not really getting a lot of new stuff coming into this bucket?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Very little from any production that was done after the crisis, Paul, as you could expect. So they're delinquency statistics. So really you still have modifications that \u2013 the re-modification work going on because people have had modifications for years. Some portion of them go back in the situation and then you have just the normal flow. But that number keeps working itself down and, based on the quality of our portfolio, should come down even significant to where it is. This is a grind now. This is just working through \u2013 if some were involved in litigation take time. It's just a grind to work them out now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Paul Miller</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And then you said in the quarter \u2013 and you disclosed this a very, very clearly \u2013 that it was about $700 million on this. Where can we \u2013 can this be cut in half by the end of the year? When does this really become immaterial do you think?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Well, as we've told you, our target \u2013 our next weigh station on improving this thing is $500 million at the end of the year and we're well on our way to get there, Paul. But your experienced in this business. That is not an acceptable number, but I just need to keep them tracking it down. What's interesting, and if you look at the headcount we show you and stuff, what is changing is they're headcount down is at 1900 or something like that, 1900 at the end of the quarter so it's come down from a high of 58000 internal people plus external contractors dramatically.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Now we've got to get some of the harder costs out, meaning the systems and technology that was overbuilt for $12 million servicing portfolio, the real estate, and that takes a little harder work. So we're grinding all that out. So say $700 million and change to $500 million and change and ultimately we've got to get it down to significantly below that $500 million to make it makes sense as a servicing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I think it's okay, but to actually be an effective servicing platform we should drive it down. Your point about immateriality is something \u2013 this is becoming less and less of an event to us. And so what we've got to execute on \u2013 it's not going to have the impact of when we had $3.1 billion of quarterly costs a few years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">$1.4 million of 60 plus day delinquent loan service.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So $500 million by year end, that's our next goal, and then when we get there we'll give you another one. But we're just \u2013 like I said earlier to Betsy on the Consumer side, we've got to keep moving this in the right direction and we have an idea where we'll get to, but we want to make sure we get the first piece out, it's $1 billion a year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Paul Miller</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay, guys. Guys, thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Our next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thanks very much. If I could just refer back to slide 16 for a moment. There's been a lot of debate about the dynamics in the auto lending market, about deterioration in underwriting and the risks of large amounts of used cars coming off of lease. Could you give us any granularity about what you are seeing in lending across the FICO spectrum and how you are anticipating that residual issue to play out?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Sure. Look, this is some perspective. We're maintaining our market share in auto lending, but we're very focused on originating prime and super prime loans. Average FICO score, as you can see on the page, of 78 and debt to income ratios are at all-time lows. Again, we're not following the market from a structuring standpoint to the longer tenors. 90% of our loans are 73 months or lower, so that's our strategy. And I think if we stick to that, we'll be fine. We did pull forward from \u2013 we had an opportunity this quarter to get more flow. We had planned to do that in later quarters. We pulled that volume to this quarter and we'll evaluate it in future quarters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And you asked a question about residual values and the volume of cars sold and what happens. We also, as part of our stress testing of our \u2013 stress testing our portfolios, internal stress testing and also for the CCAR DFAST work, we stress the collection \u2013 the recognized collection value of cars down 40% and it's not \u2013 it'd obviously have more losses, why wouldn't you? But what really controls your losses is the quality portfolio and what runs through that calculation. And that number is, because of the high quality is very low. So we test that question you're asking which is what happens if residual values or used car values continue to \u2013 fell dramatically in a recessionary environment or something and that's one of the things we test, and it's not a big number.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Right, and when you say that you pulled forward some flow, what do you mean by that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">We had the opportunity \u2013 we have relationships where \u2013 on the flow side and when we see opportunities we can pull some of that in. Originations come through the branch, they come online and they come through our relationships with financial institutions who have relationships with dealers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And our relationship with dealers also.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yes, our relationship with dealers. So every once in a while we'll see an opportunity to add some balances and if it's within our underwriting standards we'll consider it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And that was primarily on the indirect side?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. Thanks very much for the clarity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Our next question from Mike Mayo with CLSA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Hi, my short question is when will the return on equity go into the double-digit range? Look, you have a good franchise and balance sheet. You're showing growth in loans, deposits, online banking, other areas. And you're showing lower, better expenses, branches, headcount, risk but it's not adding up. I mean your stock is 15% below tangible book value and this was yet one more quarter of mid-single-digit ROEs and worse than peer efficiency. So my question is why is Bank of America less efficient than peer? And it's tough on the outside to know because you have $2 billion of expenses in Other that's not allocated to the business lines. What is your Plan B if rates don't go up and when will the ROE go into the double-digits?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Well, hi, Mike. Thank you. So I guess I would start by again \u2013 just so everybody understands the facts \u2013 we \u2013 if you adjust for FAS 91 and FAS 123, our return on tangible common equity would be roughly 8.5%. And again, as I said before, we've made a lot of progress in LAS. And if you give us any credit for the progress for the progress we think we're going to make in the future, we're going to be able to take that 8.5% even further. We've made, I think \u2013 so the key is we've got to continue to make progress on expenses and, again, I think we've demonstrated that we can do that. If you look just year-over- year, expenses are down $1 billion or 6%. If you go back to Q1, Q1 2011, we've taken quarterly expenses down, core quarterly expenses down $3.5 billion, so that's a $14 billion run rate. We've got to continue to do that. If you look this quarter at our Consumer and GWIM segments, you can see the operating leverage. If you look at the whole Company and you back off FAS91, you can see the operating leverage. So we've just got to continue to work on expenses. We're not sitting around waiting for rates to go up. It would help if they did, and that's what we're focused on.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">All right, if I can follow-up. Despite all the progress that you've made \u2013 and you talked about the LAS expenses, you can talk about New BAC, you can talk about the quarterly expense rate since 2011. But your core EPS is still $0.33 this quarter, and it was a weak \u2013 tough quarter, tough environment, but it still in that $0.35 range. So despite all those expense savings we're not seeing it in the core EPS number that's still around $0.35. So where did all those expense savings go or is this going to come through in future quarters? And I know I've asked this question on many earnings calls and also thank you, Bank of America, for having that \u2013 and Brian for having that opening letter from the lead director in the annual report. Jack Bovender says that he wants to engage more with investors. And so I do hope that he takes my questions at the annual meeting to engage a little bit more because I've asked this so many times. I still don't feel like I have an answer that I understand, so just one more try at it, Paul. Just where are these expense savings going if EPS is still in the same range?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So, they're going \u2013 you sort of have identified the opportunity that we have in a different market environment. It's a judgment I think we have to make. But a portion of these savings are going to increase growth in the future. A portion are going to the bottom line. That's the lever we can pull over an extended period of time to adjust for the market environment. We've proven we can get the expenses out. If we wanted them all to drop to the bottom line we could do that, but we need to invest in growth at the same time and we've got to balance that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So, no new BAC coming up or anything like that? It's just \u2013 as I guess, Brian, you've said, you grind it out. It's just \u2013 it would be nice to see more of the progression. Is it \u2013 do you think it's a 2016 event? A 2017 event? Or we just \u2013 when rates go up we'll see more of it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Look in terms we are focused on driving down expenses every day, every quarter, every week. You can call it anything you want. We've got a lot of focus on this and I think you're going to continue to see progress. Our operating leverage on an adjusted basis this quarter was meaningful. You can see it if you adjust the FAS 91, revenue down 3%, expenses down 6%. We're getting the operating leverage. Look at the GWIM segment, look at the Consumer segment. We are focused on it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">All right. Thank you Paul.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Our next question is from Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Hi good morning. So, I had a follow-up to Glenn's earlier question on the Wealth Management margin. I just want to get a sense as to whether we should be thinking about that 26% margin that we saw in the quarter as a good jumping off point, just given some of the tailwinds you had spoken to, whether it be the higher-margin NII growth and the absence of the legacy Merrill awards. And I suppose as it relates to that, are preparation efforts for things such as DoL compliance potentially going to weigh on the margin in future quarters?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">A couple things with that. The 26% \u2013 if you think back across the last year when we discussed this, we had the ATP piece. And so a chunk of that is that, the other chunk is good expense management. I said earlier the margin net interest income stabilizing, improving. They been growing the balances now. It's more stable. So I think it is a good starting point. It will \u2013 in some cases you would hope that it wouldn't go up a lot because that would mean asset management fees and other things are growing, which attach more compensation, less marginal profit, which will be good news, because the overall profit will grow better. But you should assume that that\u2019s a level we should hold on to if in a relatively stable environment as we see this quarter starting out at.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">When you go to the fiduciary, we've been working on that, obviously. Just because it's the final rule and it came out recently we've been working on it. So I don\u2019t think \u2013 I think to the extent there's cost embedded in that, a lot of it's in the run rate and it will be marginally in the run rate for the next few quarters. It's not a hugely substantial cost and if you even \u2013 look, we've spent a lot of time educating our teammates about doing it. There are operational cost, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s material in the grand scheme of thing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Brian I\u2019ll just add a little bit to that. I think from the very beginning we supported the fundamental objectives of the Department of Labor. And if you look at our goals based strategy, it delivers a lot of what they are getting at with that rule in terms of the best interest standard. Our Merrill Lynch One advisory platform, which we successfully completed the transition of a lot of clients this quarter. That's a great example of how we've been up front to create an experience that is really transparent, single fee schedule, etc. That's a significant investment. And we're guessing that that investment is really going to pay off here in terms of implementing this rule.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">If you look at roughly the $2 trillion of GUM [ph] client assets we have outside of deposits and loans, we think the Department of Labor will probably impact less than 10% of that. And certainly given the implementation schedule we wouldn't expect to see much of an impact, if any impact, in 2016 and as we digest the rules we'll just have to evaluate how it's going to affect out years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay. So it sounds as though a lot of the incremental expense is already in the run rate and that you don't anticipate much revenue disruption based on the final rule as written?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yes that\u2019s correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay. Got it. And maybe just focusing on the expense base within Global Markets. Was certainly pleased to see the absolute level of dollar expense was, from what I could tell, the lowest level that we've seen over the last five years. So clearly some of the efforts that you highlighted to right size the cost base have borne fruit. And as we think about the expense trajectory for this business, what should we expect in an environment where the trading revenues are relatively stable or consistent with what we saw in the most recent quarter? Is that $2.4 billion [ph] a reasonable run rate expectation?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">We\u2019re going to continue like every other segment. We\u2019re going to continue to work on bringing our cost down in this segment as well. I think there's lots of things we can do from an operational standpoint to improve profitability over the medium and long term and we're focused on that. You're right, here compensation expenses are significant and they are going to be consistent with the revenue performance. I think we were disciplined this quarter in terms of our compensation expense and you saw that in the numbers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">We\u2019ve been adjusting as you read about in the press, there is a \u2013 it's not in the run rate yet, it comes in next quarter because it happened mid-March. They made major adjustments in size of platform in mid-March. I'll give you an example. We have equity sales people year-over-year down 60 or 70 on base of despite down 15%, 20% at least. So fab in that business continues to reposition. Bernie and Jim continue on the fixed income side so they made some major adjustments to headcount.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">So we\u2019ll hold it down here. You want this expense to go up because that means the revenue has gone back up. So you've got to be careful. But the fundamental operating platform has embedded in the run rate cost actually continue to develop a systems architecture, continue to drive the compliance of Volcker and all that stuff as you go in the run rate. So the chances of the non-compensation related expenses moving a lot is not the big deal and the question is just how do you incrementally keep management down.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">The other thing to remember just in this quarter, I would just point out again, that we did have a little bit of help from litigation. We had a reversal of a prior matter. It helped on the expense line.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay. And can you quantify how much of a benefit that provided, Paul?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">We don\u2019t generally comment on those sorts of things. It was going for the $100 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay, got it. And then just one more final one for me, just on the investment banking side. You talked about stability in March continuing into April on the trading business. One of your competitors talked about actually seeing some improving trends in the capital raising environment in April versus what was clearly a challenging quarter in 1Q. I didn't know if you were seeing some improvement on the capital raising side as well. And if you can give us an update just in terms of backlogs in some of the other pockets like M&amp;A, that would be helpful.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">As you might imagine, the pipeline is \u2013 looks great because everybody \u2013 people need to transact, they just haven\u2019t \u2013 they just didn\u2019t do it in the first quarter. So it\u2019s building up in periods where there's volatility like this, the best thing our bankers can do is to be in front of CEOs, Boards and CFOs. They are doing that. There is going to be \u2013 have to be financing activity at some point because clients need to finance them. And so our pipeline was good. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say we\u2019ve seen any in the first few days of April we\u2019ve seen any dramatic increase in capital markets activity, but there is certainly lots of dialogue.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">The pipeline looks good again because I think there's a lot of pent-up demand there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I think the simple thing to think about in the investment banking Capital Market side is the work is ready to go, we just \u2013 if we continue to see the stability, you will see it come through. And that\u2019s \u2013 our comments are really based on still \u2013 they\u2019re still stabilizing as we speak. And so, if that happens, you expect to see it start pulling through and it would be up from the quarter, quarter-over-quarter. But there are still a few more weeks of stability that you have to see for people to actually pull the trigger on financings and stuff.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Obvious, the markets right now are stable. People can finance if they want to. I think it\u2019s just a question, as Brian said, of CEOs and Boards just making sure that the stability we\u2019re seeing right now is something that they can count on as they go to market.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">And we can take our next question from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ken Usdin</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Thanks. Good morning. Brian, right at the outset you said that there has really been no meaningful change in the customer base activity. And then the following on your comments about stable capital markets, you are growing the core loan book now double-digits still, 11%. I\u2019m just wondering how much of that is the environment holding up. How much of that is still the spigot opening from reasonable growth? And just your outlook in terms of customer behavior on the lending side?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">The other thing, Ken, is that you have to remember that for a long period of time we were fighting the runoff of the non-core assets, which are now small enough that we could actually overcome them. So there are a lot of quarters where the core activity was growing but you couldn\u2019t find it because \u2013 if you look at the slide you can see the All Other, which is the investment portfolio, really mortgages and then the LAS assets are now small enough so that the quarter-to-quarter runoff. But I think it\u2019s solid across-the-board.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">I think that in the segments we focus in on the Consumer side, prime, super prime, there\u2019s strong activity. Mortgages, you could see the origination volumes this quarter were solid. I think if you think of home equity has kicked back up a little bit again because people see home equity in their house. The auto businesses strong, but it will ebb and flow with how many units get sold ultimately because that\u2019s the nature of the business. Although I think we can gain share there because our share on our direct-to-consumer business was very low. We didn\u2019t even do it two years ago and now we\u2019re up to, I don\u2019t know, $0.5 billion or more a quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">So I think from a consumer side, the card business, because we\u2019ve now sold through all the portfolios we have to sell, I think you should see stable and start to see better year-over-year comparables than we\u2019ve had the last several years. Obviously last big portfolio went out in the fourth quarter, and so I think we feel good. If you look at the online customers, the creditworthy customers that we deal with are there to borrow and we\u2019re lending to them. And if you go on the Commercial side, as Paul said earlier, I think you would expect us the CRE \u2013 we slowed \u2013 we want to be careful in CRE, so we are doing very fundamentally structured loans.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">But in C&amp;I, and a nice \u2013 business banking, not a huge business for us, frankly, but they finally are making it through their runoff and that\u2019s good. And so I think across all those businesses you should see \u2013 it may not grow as fast as normally it has. Two years ago we had the international book grow and corporate \u2013 we slowed that down based on our judgments about risk. And so I think it\u2019s a pretty balanced growth. And so the question always is do you have to compromise your credit standards to grow? No, we don\u2019t because you can see that. And then secondly, is there opportunity to actually get growth? And the answer is yes. But \u2013 and that\u2019s just good, hard work.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ken Usdin</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Yes, Brian, to that last point, how much opportunity actually, without pointing to compromising, but how much more spigot opening can you still do, to your point about the post crisis, the tightening up internally? Are you still under lent, if at all. Or you still have to be somewhat careful about where we are in this stage of the economic cycle being that we are seven-plus years into an expansion?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">We have to be careful and that\u2019s what I think we wanted to show you some of the \u2013 there are two \u2013 three basic principles that you have to follow. One is, we had to balance the portfolios between Commercial and Consumer. Second, we had to get the Consumer to secured portfolios dominating versus unsecured both credit card \u2013 now the loans really put us behind \u2013 in a tough situation last time. And then, third, you\u2019ve got to maintain your individual quality of underwriting. Consumer is more formulaic and Commercial more deal selection and customer selection. But if you look at it \u2013 I\u2019ll just give you the simplest way to think about this.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">We have moved probably from 8 out of 10 mortgage holders who are absolutely within our credit box, absolutely we do business with, getting their mortgage somewhere else to maybe 7. So we\u2019ve still got 7 more to go without talking about expanding the credit parameters in our mortgage business one iota. So think of that as a demonstration point that you can go over and over again. So there is plenty of market share out there. And then one of the things, Ken, we\u2019re looking at is we look across our 90-odd markets in the United States.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">There are areas where we have tremendous opportunity to expand our market share where the franchise just wasn\u2019t balanced. Some areas of franchise, the wealth management business is a high percentage; in some places, it\u2019s low. The middle-market business is very high market \u2013 very strong, good market shares in certain markets and a third of that in other markets. And so, where we\u2019re deploying these people is also based on our view of which market.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">So it\u2019s going into that market, hiring talent, using this massive customer capability we have to go drive it. Again, target the exact customers we want. So, even on a geographic basis, whether it\u2019s the deposit business and expanding in some of those markets, but also in the commercial lending business and \u2013 otherwise there\u2019s opportunities without compromising credit.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">As Brian said, that\u2019s where those added sales professionals are going. They\u2019re going to markets where we think we have synergies across commercial, GWIM and Consumer.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ken Usdin</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Okay, got it. So in some \u2013 you think this 10% plus primary lending is still achievable? That\u2019s what it sounds like from what you\u2019re saying.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Well, I think we\u2019ve been telling people to focus more on mid-single-digits type of numbers in a given 2% growth \u2013 1.5%, 2% growth economy as opposed to 10%. So \u2013 but the core business is growing faster and then we\u2019re still running off, but we\u2019ve told people to focus in at that level.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ken Usdin</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Okay. Understood. Thanks, guys.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Our next question is from Nancy Bush with NAB Research.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Good morning, Nancy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Nancy Bush</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Good morning. Brian, I think we\u2019ve all over the last few years been trying to find banking normal and it\u2019s proving hard to find. And it kind of has begun to strike some of us that maybe first quarter \u2013 what we saw in the first quarter in terms of volatility and continued low rates, etc., etc., is banking normal, at least for the foreseeable future. And under that scenario, if you believe that, would you \u2013 have you begun to look at \u2013 take a second look at your businesses again? And will there be any sort of reallocation of capital going forward and are there businesses you might want to exit?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">I\u2019m not sure you can consider first-quarter banking normal in the sense that we still have extra costs we\u2019ve got a get out of here, Nancy, that we continue to work down. Litigation was elevated in the quarter from more the normalized level that we feel we can achieve and things like that. But leave that aside. The basic principle is we continuously look at the franchise to see about optimization. So generally when people ask that question they are thinking about a couple different areas. One is the markets area.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">We show you the markets. Profitability returns in this business. But if you get into the supplement you\u2019ll see you can never call a markets business an annuity business. But what drives our business is really a connection between the issuer clients, the commercial borrowers and commercial clients and the investor clients that we serve. And to do that \u2013 in our Wealth Management business, because that\u2019s a group of people that rely on the research platform.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">If you look, the interconnectedness of that is massive and \u2013 whether it\u2019s by us getting out of proprietary trading and Volcker and things like that, the whole \u2013 the real business is driven at that. And so, if you \u2013 we\u2019ve taken the balance sheet from implying at the time of Merrill, probably nearly to $800 billion or more, maybe closer to $1 trillion down to $500 billion and the revenues have stabilized and I think that\u2019s a good place for us to be. Number one research plant in the world. Number one in the U.S. this year. The ability to use it in wealth management, the ability to use it to inform our corporate customers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">So, we look at how we pare away things and look at it \u2013 so in the international business we\u2019ve pared back \u2013 there was 1,200 \u2013 I don\u2019t know, 800 to 1,200 people that were downsized in markets and banking in the first quarter. So we keep \u2013 it\u2019s not in or out, it\u2019s more how do you keep paring it back. And so, if you look across there, we always look at that question. We continue to look at it, but right now we really like the franchise and the connectivity between the franchise of all the different elements, focused on markets, focused on wealth management, focused on the core business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">And I think now the question is with low rates, we just have to grind the cost down and that\u2019s going to come out of really all the pieces and \u2013 well, for a while, it was \u2013 you could go at it at a fairly high level and drive it. Now it\u2019s really incrementally idea by idea and taking it out and that\u2019s why you see that constant improvement. Improvement of core costs of $2 billion run rate first quarter last year to first quarter this year is not \u2013 is working at it. It just takes more time because 130 million square feet of real estate down to 80 million go into 70 million. There\u2019s a lot of work to get out of that real estate.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Nancy Bush</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Right. Just as an add-on and looking at costs in the consumer bank, and you look at your mobile penetration and how it\u2019s going up, etc., etc. Is there a magic number in terms of \u2013 mobile transactions, mobile penetration, just the whole use of mobile in your Company where I think you\u2019ve been a leader that will lead to sort of a step down in branches. Are we sort of on this threshold of being able to take branches down yet another however many?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Well, I think if you think of branches and think about it as offices as opposed to the historical notion of a place where you transact, the question of how many you have is going to be how many relationship managers you need and how many places they have to sit. And so, what we\u2019ve done is consolidated the branches to be even bigger. So the sheer number \u2013 so we added 6,100 or 4,600. Each year we\u2019ve repositioned 200 or 300 of them. But what we\u2019re doing is getting out of smaller branches and building into bigger branches. So we consolidated three into one and build up \u2013 that branch has in it U.S. trust people, Wealth Management people, small business salespeople.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">So what we\u2019re actually \u2013 if you think about it as a real estate question, the number is not as important as they are full and that they are marginally driving the profit. And you can get a lot of salespeople per square inch, a lot of customer activity per square inch, and that\u2019s where we\u2019re going. And so, you\u2019re going to see some of the new prototypes that we\u2019ve deployed. You can see in places like Denver where we\u2019re now on our third branch and we\u2019ll continue to build out that are much \u2013 look much more like a sales office than what people\u2019s vision of a traditional branch.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">But going to your earlier question, Nancy, I don\u2019t know where this stops and I\u2019m not \u2013 that\u2019s not saying I\u2019m trying to hide an answer that I have, it\u2019s just that if you and I were here last year, and we were, and you said 17 million mobile users, that\u2019s good penetration, it\u2019s 2 million more a year later. And as computer-based banking is up 1.5 million or something like that, which is kind of remarkable on top of that. So we don\u2019t know where this goes, but we\u2019re going to be pushing ahead, following our clients and making sure we stay with them. At the same time, our customer satisfaction scores are now reaching an all-time high, which means the way we\u2019re doing it works for them.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">And you\u2019ve given me your feedback about our customer focus and capabilities over the years, but they are back to the highest they\u2019ve ever been and that\u2019s, importantly, managing that transition carefully and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to do.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Nancy Bush</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Okay. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">I just want to echo a couple of thoughts the Brian said. I think the branches are going to become not a destination where people come to transact but destination where people come because they need a product or service because of something changing in their lives. They need to start saving for their kids\u2019 college or they need a new \u2013 they need a mortgage or they need a credit card. It\u2019s more about they are coming there because of some life event or because of some product or service they need, not for every day transaction banking.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">We\u2019ll still have the branches that can do that for people who prefer that, but I think over time people will recognize the convenience and safety of doing these things online, doing them electronic not from paper. And the branches will become \u2013 we\u2019re organizing our branches so that they become destinations for people who need help with their financial lives.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Nancy Bush</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Our next question comes from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Hi, Marty.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">I wanted to focus on mortgage banking and the retention of those loans, more on the balance sheet than continuing to push them to the GSIBs. Is that regulatory driven or are you really looking for that higher retention rate because you\u2019re looking for some assets that have duration, so is that one of the better maybe option adjusted yields that you can get at this point?</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Marty, you can come at this a fairly straightforward way which is we have $1.2 trillion in deposits and we have $900 billion in loans. And if we put our own mortgages on the balance sheet we know the quality, we know the customer and we know that the servicing cost ultimately will be a lot less of how we\u2019re doing it. If we buy third-party loans \u2013 so to extract the value of those deposits we\u2019ve got to invest in something. We invested substantially in treasuries. We have to \u2013 back to mortgages and mortgage-backed securities. And so the question is why by someone else\u2019s when you are producing your own?</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">So it\u2019s really a very pragmatic view of \u2013 we want to control our destiny in mortgage going forward so that the customer we look in the eye and originate the mortgage with is the customers we service for, is the customer we have the asset quality with and there is no third-party involved. So it\u2019s more driven by us just getting to our own, controlling our own destiny.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">And a follow-up to that is if you look at the impact of that on the business segments you actually are increasing the portfolio by about 30%, which is showing that retention. However, if you look at all other, it\u2019s more than overkill swamping that growth.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Right.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">You had about a $45 billion reduction, and kind of getting back to Mike\u2019s question about where is the benefits going, just the reduction in All Other, that almost $50 billion of loans is over $1 billion worth of NII that is going away, whereas you are having to do and invest and spend money to generate the 30% growth in the business. So is the runoff still part of where some of the leakage is that we are hoping to get in all the improvements in growth that you\u2019re showing in the core? And when does that \u2013 what\u2019s left is about $100 billion, when is that finally done so that you wouldn\u2019t have that leakage anymore?</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">Well, the \u2013 we used to \u2013 there is an element that\u2019s just as \u2013 we used to book that retained piece in the central area. We stopped doing that. That\u2019s showing the changeover, so you\u2019ve got to think of it a little bit together. But \u2013 and it\u2019s consistent with our peers. Most people have their consumer businesses booked to loans they retain. We just didn\u2019t do that for years. But remember, those \u2013 you\u2019ve got to remember that you\u2019ve got to think of the whole balance sheet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">You\u2019re looking at the loan category. The money comes out of center because of liquidity demands in the rules. It goes into treasuries and other securities which are not in that chart because they are not loans, mortgage-backed securities and treasuries and that still has a yield to it. Not as dollar-denominated as much as mortgages but has a yield to it. That has been driven more by the liquidity demands in LCR than it is by anything else, which is the centralized portfolio. We\u2019ve gone from $100 billion in liquidity four or five years ago to $500 billion, so that has a cost to it in that \u2013 in prior years that could have been invested in high-yielding assets, but not \u2013 mortgages don\u2019t count for liquidity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">Got you. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">And again, look \u2013 the facts are we\u2019ve been growing overall, so year-over-year including those segments which, as you point off by our strategy are running off faster. We\u2019re still growing the overall balance sheet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">And we take our last question as a follow-up from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">Hi, it\u2019s a follow-up on mortgage. So I think one of your suppliers or one of your partners, PHH, mentioned that you were going to be pulling back some of the servicing to yourself. And I just wanted to understand did you have to do anything to build for that book of business or is this already something that\u2019s in your run rate on the expense side and we\u2019re going to be bringing in incremental revenues on the mortgage servicing side?</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">It\u2019s marginally \u2013 will be absorbed. If you think about it, the total number of loans is relatively small. The total \u2013 it will go on the platform of very little change.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">Okay, and is this the beginning of pulling it all over?</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">I think \u2013 I would just say that we\u2019re trying to be consistent with our strategy of controlling our own destiny.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">Okay. All right. That\u2019s great. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">And it appears we have no further questions.

The approach that yields the lower ratio is to be used to assess capital adequacy; therefore, we used the Advanced approaches at June 30,2016and March 31,2016.Prior to exiting parallel run, we were required to report regulatory capital under the Standardized approach only. 5 Basel 3 fully phased-in Advanced approaches estimates assume approval by U.S.banking regulators of our internal analytical models, including approval of the internal models methodology (IMM). As of 6June 30,2016,BAC did not have regulatory approval for the IMM model. As previously disclosed, with the approval to exit parallel run, U.S.banking regulators requested modifications to certain internal analytical models including the wholesale (e.g.,commercial) credit models, which increased our risk-weighted assets under the Advanced approaches beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015. 7See note D on slide 27. 5\" data-src=\"https://staticseekingalpha.a.ssl.fastly.net/uploads/sa_presentations/177/177/slides/5.jpg?1468853415\" title=\" Balance Sheet, Liquidity and Capital Highlights\"></figure><figure class=\"item\" data-index=\"6\" itemprop=\"image\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"https://schema.org/ImageObject\"><meta content=\"https://staticseekingalpha1.a.ssl.fastly.net/uploads/sa_presentations/177/177/slides/6.jpg?1468853415\" itemprop=\"url\">\n<meta content=\"1280\" itemprop=\"width\">\n<meta content=\"960\" itemprop=\"height\">\n<img alt=\"Average Total Loans &amp; Leases Average Loans &amp; Leases in All Other $1,000 $876 $877 $886 $893 $900 $200 $157 $750 $139 $150 10 $130 $122 25 10 $116 24 10 10 $500 $100 22 21 20 $250 $50 117 101 93 87 82 $0 $0 2Q15 3Q15 4Q15 1Q16 2Q16 2Q15 3Q15 4Q15 1Q16 2Q16 Residential Home equity Non-U.S. credit card Other Average Loans &amp; Leases in Business Segments Average Total Deposits $771 $784 $1,186 $1,198 $1,213 $800 $719 $738 $756 $1,250 $1,147 $1,159 63 66 69 69 70 66 63 63 63 62 $1,000 297 299 $600 288 296 308 295 305 315 325 330 $750 260 255 $400 240 244 251 $500 131 134 137 139 141 $200 243 $250 553 556 564 578 596 231 233 235 238 $0 $0 2Q15 3Q15 4Q15 1Q16 2Q16 2Q15 3Q15 4Q15 1Q16 2Q16 Consumer Banking GWIM Global Banking Global Markets Consumer Banking GWIM Global Banking Other (GM and All Other) ____________________ Note: Amounts may not total due to rounding. 6\" data-src=\"https://staticseekingalpha1.a.ssl.fastly.net/uploads/sa_presentations/177/177/slides/6.jpg?1468853415\" title=\" Loans &amp; Leases and Deposits ($B)\"></figure><figure class=\"item\" data-index=\"7\" itemprop=\"image\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"https://schema.org/ImageObject\"><meta content=\"https://staticseekingalpha3.a.ssl.fastly.net/uploads/sa_presentations/177/177/slides/7.jpg?1468853415\" itemprop=\"url\">\n<meta content=\"1280\" itemprop=\"width\">\n<meta content=\"960\" itemprop=\"height\">\n<img alt=\"Net Charge-offs ($MM)  Totalreported and adjustednet charge-offs declined $83MM and $39MM versus 1Q16 $1,200 $1,068 $1,144 $1,068 1.0% $985  Declinein reported net charge-offs driven primarily by lower $932 charge-offson nonperformingloan (NPL) sales and the $900 absenceof DoJ charge-offs in the consumerreal estate portfolio $600 0.5% 0.49% 0.52% 0.48%  Declinein adjusted net charge-offs due to continuedportfolio 0.43% 0.44% improvementacrossmostproducts $300 Provisionof $976MM declined $21MM from 1Q16 $0 0.0% 2Q15 3Q15 4Q15 1Q16 2Q16 Net charge-offs Net charge-off ratio 1 Adjusted Net Charge-offs ($MM) Provision for Credit Losses ($MM) $1,200 1.0% $1,200 $929 $937 $1,005 $1,019 $980 $997 $976 $900 $900 $780 $806 $810 $600 0.5% $600 0.45% 0.46% $300 0.43% 0.43% 0.44% $300 $0 0.0% $0 2Q15 3Q15 4Q15 1Q16 2Q16 2Q15 3Q15 4Q15 1Q16 2Q16 Adjusted net charge-offs Adjusted net charge-off ratio ____________________ 1Represents a non-GAAP financial measure.

As of June 30,2016,BAC did not have regulatory approval for the IMM model. 4 As previously disclosed, with the approval to exit parallel run, U.S.banking regulators requested modifications to certain internal analytical models including the wholesale (e.g.,commercial) credit models, which increased our risk-weighted assets under the Advanced approaches beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015. 26\" data-src=\"https://staticseekingalpha3.a.ssl.fastly.net/uploads/sa_presentations/177/177/slides/26.jpg?1468853415\" title=\" 1, 2\"></figure><figure class=\"item\" data-index=\"27\" itemprop=\"image\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"https://schema.org/ImageObject\"><meta content=\"https://staticseekingalpha1.a.ssl.fastly.net/uploads/sa_presentations/177/177/slides/27.jpg?1468853415\" itemprop=\"url\">\n<meta content=\"1280\" itemprop=\"width\">\n<meta content=\"960\" itemprop=\"height\">\n<img alt=\"AMarket-related NII adjustments include retrospective changes to debt security premium or discount amortization resulting from changes in estimated prepayments, due primarily to changes in interest rates, and hedge ineffectiveness. Amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts are included in interest income. When a change is made to the estimated lives of the securities, primarily as a result of changes in interest rates, the related premium or discount is adjusted, with a corresponding charge or benefit to interest income, to the appropriate amount had the current estimated lives been applied since the purchase of the securities. For more information, see Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporations 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. B Global Excess Liquidity Sources include cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities, limited to U.S. government securities, U.S. agency securities, U.S. agency MBS, and a select group of non-U.S. government and supranational securities, and are readily available to meet funding requirements as they arise. It does not include Federal Reserve Discount Window or Federal Home Loan Bank borrowing capacity. Transfers of liquidity from the bank or other regulated entities are subject to certain regulatory restrictions. CTime to Required Funding (TTF) is a debt coverage measure and is expressed as the number of months unsecured holding company obligations of Bank of America Corporation can be met using only the BAC parent companys Global Excess Liquidity Sources without issuing debt or sourcing additional liquidity. We define unsecured contractual obligations for purposes of this metric as maturities of senior or subordinated debt issued or guaranteed by Bank of America Corporation. For the period shown in 2015, we have included in the amount of unsecured contractual obligations the liability, including estimated costs, for the previously announced BNY Mellon private-label securitization settlement. In 1Q16, settlement payment was made for $8.5B. DThe numerator of the SLR is quarter-end Basel 3 Tier 1 capital. The denominator is total leverage exposure based on the daily average of the sum of on-balance sheet exposures less permitted Tier 1 deductions, as well as the simple average of certain off-balance sheet exposures, as of the end of each month in a quarter. Off-balance sheet exposures primarily include undrawn lending commitments, letters of credit, potential future derivative exposures and repo-style transactions. E Revenue for all periods included net DVA on derivatives, as well as amortization of own credit portion of purchase discount and realized DVA on structured liabilities.Net DVA gains (losses) were ($164MM), $154MM and ($199MM) for 2Q16, 1Q16 and 2Q15, respectively. Net DVA gains (losses) included in FICC revenue were ($160MM), $140MM and ($200MM) for 2Q16, 1Q16 and 2Q15, respectively. Net DVA gains (losses) included in equities revenue were ($4MM), $14MM and $1MM for 2Q16, 1Q16 and 2Q15, respectively. FVaR model uses historical simulation approach based on three years of historical data and an expected shortfall methodology equivalent to a 99% confidence level. Using a 95% confidence level, average VaR was $24MM, $23MM and $23MM for 2Q16, 1Q16 and 2Q15, respectively. 27\" data-src=\"https://staticseekingalpha1.a.ssl.fastly.net/uploads/sa_presentations/177/177/slides/27.jpg?1468853415\" title=\"Notes\"></figure><figure class=\"item\" data-index=\"28\" itemprop=\"image\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"https://schema.org/ImageObject\"><meta content=\"https://staticseekingalpha3.a.ssl.fastly.net/uploads/sa_presentations/177/177/slides/28.jpg?1468853415\" itemprop=\"url\">\n<meta content=\"1280\" itemprop=\"width\">\n<meta content=\"960\" itemprop=\"height\">\n<img alt=\"Bank of America and its management may make certain statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

It speaks only as of the particular date or dates included in the accompanyingslides. Bank of America does not undertake an obligation to, and disclaims any duty to, update any of the information provided. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. Beginning in the first quarter of 2016, the Corporation classifies operating leases in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For December 31, 2015, September 30, 2015 and June 30, 2015, $6.0B, $5.6B, and $5.3B, respectively, of operating leases were reclassified from loans and leases to other assets to conform to this presentation. Additionally, amounts related to these leases were reclassified from net interest income to other income and other general operating expenses on the Consolidated Statement of Income. The Corporation may present certain key performance indicators and ratios excluding certain items (e.g., market-related adjustments on net interest income, debit valuation adjustments, charge-offs related to the settlement with the DOJ) which result in non-GAAP financial measures. The Corporation believes the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides additional clarity in understanding its results of operations and trends. For more information about the non-GAAP financialmeasures contained herein, please see the presentation of the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordancewith GAAP and accompanyingreconciliationsin the earnings press release for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 and other earnings-related information available through the Bank of America Investor Relations web site at: http://investor.bankofamerica.com. The Company views net interest income and related ratios and analyses on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis, which when presented on a consolidated basis, are non-GAAP financial measures. The Company believes managing the business with net interest income on an FTE basis provides a more accurate picture of the interest margin for comparative purposes. The FTE adjustment was $223MM, $215MM, $226MM, $226MM and $223MM for 2Q16, 1Q16, 4Q15, 3Q15 and 2Q15, respectively. The Companys fully phased-in Basel 3 estimates and the supplementary leverage ratio are based on the Standardized and Advanced approaches under Basel 3 and supplementary leverage ratio final rules. Under the Basel 3 Advanced approaches, risk-weighted assets are determined primarily for market risk and credit risk, similar to the Standardized approach, but also incorporate operational risk and a credit valuation adjustment component. Market risk capital measurements are consistent with the Standardized approach, except for securitization exposures, where the Supervisory Formula Approach is also permitted. Credit risk exposures are measured using internal ratings-based models to determine the applicablerisk weight by estimating the probability of default, loss given default and, in certain instances, exposure at default. The internal analytical models primarily rely on internal historical default and loss experience. The calculations under Basel 3 require management to make estimates, assumptions and interpretations, including the probability of future events based on historical experience. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. Bank of America received approval to begin using the Advanced approaches capital framework to determine risk- based capital requirements beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015. As previously disclosed, with the approval to exit parallel, U.S. banking regulators requested modificationsto certain internal analytical models including the wholesale (e.g., commercial)credit models, which increased our risk-weighted assets under the Advanced approaches beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015. These Basel 3 fully phased-in Advanced approaches estimates assume approval by U.S. banking regulators of our internal analyticalmodels, includingapproval of the internal models methodology (IMM). As of June 30, 2016, BAC did not have regulatory approval for the IMM model. Our estimates under the Basel 3 Advanced approaches may be refined over time as a result of further rulemaking or clarification by U.S. banking regulators. The Company allocates capital to its business segments using a methodology that considers the effect of regulatory capital requirements in addition to internal risk-based capital models. The Company's internal risk-based capital models use a risk-adjusted methodology incorporating each segment's credit, market, interest rate, business and operational risk components. Allocated capital is reviewed periodically and refinements are made based on multiple considerations that include, but are not limited to, risk-weighted assets measured under Basel 3 Standardized and Advanced approaches, business segment exposures and risk profile and strategic plans. As a result of this process, in the first quarter 2016, the Company adjusted the amount of capital being allocated to its business segments. 29\" data-src=\"https://staticseekingalpha1.a.ssl.fastly.net/uploads/sa_presentations/177/177/slides/29.jpg?1468853415\" title=\" Important Presentation Information\"></figure><figure class=\"item\" data-index=\"30\" itemprop=\"image\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"https://schema.org/ImageObject\"><meta content=\"https://staticseekingalpha3.a.ssl.fastly.net/uploads/sa_presentations/177/177/slides/30.jpg?1468853415\" itemprop=\"url\">\n<meta content=\"1280\" itemprop=\"width\">\n<meta content=\"960\" itemprop=\"height\">\n<img data-src=\"https://staticseekingalpha3.a.ssl.fastly.net/uploads/sa_presentations/177/177/slides/30.jpg?1468853415\"></figure><div class=\"press-overlay\"><div class=\"pull-right press-overlay-cnt\">\n<div class=\"pull-left\">Click to enlarge</div>\n<div class=\"pull-right\">\n<!--[if (gt IE 8)|(IEMobile)]><!--><svg height=\"14\" viewbox=\"10.600000381469727 10.5 10.799999237060547 11\" width=\"14\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M14.4 10.5h7v7M17.6 21.5h-7v-7\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"#FFFFFF\" stroke-miterlimit=\"10\" stroke-width=\"2\"></path></svg><!--<![endif]--><!--[if (lt IE 9)&(!IEMobile)]><span></span><![endif]-->\n</div>\n<div class=\"clearfix\"></div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"notes hidden\"><div class=\"note-w\">\n<span class=\"ttl\">Notes:</span> <span class=\"note-ctn\"></span>\n</div></div>\n</div></div>\n<meta itemprop=\"url\" content=\"https://staticseekingalpha1.a.ssl.fastly.net/images/revshare/placeholder.png\"></span></p>"]},

At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. Later you will have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note this call is being recorded.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. Lee McEntire. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Lee McEntire</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning. Thanks to everybody on the phone as well as the webcast for joining us this morning for the second quarter 2016 results. Hopefully everybody\u2019s had a chance to review the earnings release documents that were available on our website.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Before I turn the call over to Brian and Paul, let me remind you we may make some forward-looking statements. For further information on those, please refer to either our earnings release documents, our website or our SEC filings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">So before Brian and Paul get into the results, just let me mention one housekeeping item. Please limit your questions to one per caller so that we can get to everyone, and you can circle back.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Brian Moynihan, our Chairman and CEO, for some opening comments; before Paul Donofrio, our CFO, goes through the details. Brian?</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you, Lee, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our second quarter results. I\u2019m beginning on slide two of the materials we sent to you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We reported solid earnings of $4.2 billion after tax, or $0.36 per diluted share, in what was certainly an eventful quarter for the markets from an overall macro perspective. This compares to $5.1 billion or $0.43 per share in the year-ago quarter. This quarter included negative market related NII adjustments that cost $0.05 per share and negative DVA that cost us another penny for a total of $0.06. That compares to a $0.03 benefit for EPS for both those items in the second quarter of 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Earnings neutralizing for the past 91 DVA for both periods improved from $0.40 per share to $0.42 per share on a year-over-year basis. Our results represent another quarter of solid progress in the strategies we have been executing. Those strategies are delivering more of the company\u2019s capabilities to each and every client we serve. At BAC, we focus on what we can control, and despite low rates and other macro events, we continue to focus on managing our risk, our costs and our delivery of quality products and customer service.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">In Q2, we grew loans $22 billion or approximately 2.5% versus last year, even as we sold a few portfolios during the year. All this growth was organic and consistent with our risk appetite. We also grew deposits more than $66 billion or 6% over that same time period, and we did so while maintaining disciplined deposit pricing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We also continued to transform our company in a digital way at all things and all businesses. For example, this quarter we crossed over 20 million active mobile users and continued to increase their use of digital channels for both transactions and buying more bank products. Active mobile banking customers logged into their accounts over 900 million times this quarter, depositing more than 25 million checks, with more than 20 million via mobile check deposits. They made over 25 million mobile bill payments, up 30% year-over-year, and made nearly 80 million transfers. Person to person, or P2P, payments continue to ramp up as well. While still a small component of the overall consumer payments this quarter, we had $6.7 billion in P2P payments this quarter. That is more than $13 billion year to date and is up 20% from last year. This channel is a valued channel for all our customers and made possible by the [indiscernible] investment we make.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">As we move to slide three, we have talked to you \u2013 a lot of you over the last several months including many of you on the phone today. I thought I\u2019d try to address some of the more common questions we get from those conversations by looking at our results \u2013 by looking at the income statement and the items therein.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">First, one of the core questions is what if rates stay lower for longer? Well, for bank management and for you as investors it would be easier if rates were to rise but that hasn\u2019t happened. So the question is can we grow earnings without rates improving? We believe we surely can. We can do that by continued success on things like expense management, by keeping NII stable to growing, stable and growing fees, and continue to manage risk well and hold down our credit costs. As you can see, revenue this quarter was $20.6 billion on an FTE basis. Adjusted for the negative impacts of market-related NII adjustments and DVA, that number is $21.8 billion. Adjusted for the same items in the year-ago quarter, the total was comparable.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Now as we focus in on NII, Paul will take you through some of the changes this quarter later in the presentation. However, in summary, adjusted for market-related changes in both last year\u2019s second quarter and this year\u2019s second quarter, we grew NII by 400 million or 4% year-over-year. And that took place while the 10-year Treasury yield fell 86 basis points from last year on a spot basis. Going forward in a stable interest rate environment, we believe we can maintain NII around the second quarter 2016 level based on the current loan and deposit growth we see. And if rates rise, we would expect NII to grow.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Another question relates to Global Markets business. That question is often asked how we need to change this business, especially the FICC area as many of our customers have. I want to hit this head on. First of all, fixed income a good business for us here at Bank of America. It is a business which benefits not only by its core activities but by being coupled with our massive global banking franchise that has leadership positions across the globe. Combined together, they generate a pretty steady billion dollars or so of quarterly investment banking fees. It\u2019s also an important part of our overall Global Markets platform, the platform which sits on top of the number one global research team for the past five years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In the second quarter, this business did well. Global Markets generated $3.7 billion in sales and trading revenue excluding DVA. Compared to the same period last year, that is up 12%. This year-over-year improvement is driven by FICC sales and trading, which is up 22%. Now think about that. Sales and trading revenue including DVA for this quarter is the highest second quarter we have experienced in five years and it led to one of the most profitable quarters for Global Markets we have seen in the past five years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Also the team served clients well during a period of difficult volatility. So clearly it remains a profitable important business for us to serve clients. We\u2019re proud of how the team supported their clients through the Brexit both in the periods of volatility related there too.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Another question is getting clarity on how we\u2019re transforming the business on the fee lines. Noninterest revenue was $11.2 billion this quarter. Although modestly down from second quarter 2015, it was up nicely from the first quarter. There are a lot of the items that one through the various lines of fees. First with regard to consumer fees, we are largely done with the big card portfolio divestitures and branch divestitures. Both those impacted both card fees and banking service charges and you can see them coming off the bottom as you look at the linked quarters. Fees now will grow with the volume of cards and accounts that are now net growing in our company. Our mortgage business is now sized appropriately for our franchise and the fee line there Paul will talk about later, but will be as that near where it\u2019s going to be in the future.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">With regard to revenue more closely tied to markets business, the ups and downs in volumes of activity in sales and trading in investment banking and brokerage will move back and forth with the market. But the important thing is we have strong businesses, strong client-facing businesses in these areas and we\u2019re getting our share of these revenue streams even while the markets ebbs and flows.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">So if we look about move from the fee line to the expense line, many of you give us credit for having managed expenses from $70 billion five years ago to the mid-$50 billion today. But the question is can we do more? And if you look at this quarter we continue to manage expenses well. Noninterest expense this quarter was $13.5 billion, improving more than 3.5% or 3% from 2015 second quarter. This continues a trend of performance that has shown expense declining significantly on a quarterly basis quarter-after-quarter over the past several years. This is the lowest level that we have reported since the fourth quarter of 2008, and that\u2019s prior to the Merrill Lynch merger.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">If you look at our efficiency ratio and normalize it for the NII adjustment stated above, it would be about 62% this quarter. That\u2019s an improvement 200 basis points from last year\u2019s second quarter. Cost control and cost effectiveness is a focus for our management team here at Bank of America. So the question is how much more can we do on expenses? So if you think about this, let\u2019s start by looking at the costs of the most recent four quarters. In the trailing four quarters the total expense base was $56.3 billion. As we look out from the second \u2013 the third quarter of 2016 through the next six quarters into 2018, we believe that with our SIM efforts and the continued work we\u2019re doing across the board on expenses, we\u2019re targeting an annual expense number of around $53 billion in total expenses for the year 2018.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">So over six quarters we continue to absorb investment, merit increases, rising healthcare costs, and bring the expenses down a nominal amount. Our continued work in driving down costs to service delinquent loans will help with this, but the other reductions are generally coming from the core work and simplified improved. The work we continue to do to simplify those work processes but also the core work we do to allow us to self-fund our growth initiatives, are continuing investments in technology and salespeople.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">While I\u2019m on the topic of expenses, I want to point out another important milestone for our company in quarter. This quarter we changed our reporting to eliminate the legacy assets in the servicing segment. This completes transformation. This segment was last place for product orientation was reported, not customer orientation. And more importantly, it also reflects the last of legacy is really behind us from an operational basis. We added a couple slides in the appendix today to go along with our 8-K we filed a few days ago. They explain the methodology of the realignment of LAS and the highlights that impacts the segment with those loans and associated P&amp;L are reported now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">But what I want to get to across to you is LAS as an operational segment successfully did what it was tasked to do: to clean up one of the largest mortgage servicing businesses in the U.S. Consider that progress. From 1.4 million delinquent mortgage loans we\u2019re down to 80,000 a day. At one point we had 58,000 teammates and 20,000 contractors working on this task, and now we\u2019re down to 10,000 teammates. From one peak a quarter of $3 billion plus in expenses, we\u2019re down to $600 million this quarter. That phase of the work is complete and we need to move that operating business in with the rest of the company to do the further consolidation and further work to improve our servicing cost. We are pleased with the accomplishments of this group but there is still more to be done.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">And that brings us to our provision. Simply put, the question we often get is, is credit deteriorating? As you can see, we remain very pleased with both consumer and commercial credit performance. Not only have net charge-offs not gotten worse, but they have improved in the most recent quarter moving back below $1 billion. Provision expense is and will remain roughly equivalent to net charge-offs. Even our energy portfolio we have seen lower exposures improve losses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">And that brings us to our returns. In this operating environment, can we get our returns above our cost of capital? Well as you can see, we\u2019ve made solid progress on our returns this quarter. Our return on tangible common equity adjusted for the market related and DVA impacts was 10.9%. On a similarly adjusted basis, ROA has moved to 90 basis point. We still have work to do, but you can see the improvement coming through.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As we move to slide four, you can see our business segment results. You see strong year-over-year results in every business driven by the generation of operating leverage. Consumer banking continue its momentum around client activity and operating leverage. Consumer satisfaction continues to improve as does adoption and use of digital capabilities and functionality. And our wealth management business, they grew earnings as costs declined more than revenue while we continue to invest in this business. Revenue is impacted by AUM valuations from market variability.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Our global banking team drove results with continued solid loan growth, operating leverage of 9% and strong credit results. Global markets executed well for its clients, as I stated earlier, in a very difficult period, and used operating leverage to grow its earnings year over year as well. So on a combined basis, those four business segments improved 16% from last year\u2019s second quarter earning about $5 billion this quarter. Partially offsetting this was the loss at all other, and that primarily reflects the market related NII adjustments I spoke about earlier. You can see the returns and efficiency ratios for each of these segments, and note that each segment is earning well above our cost of capital.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Paul to take you through the numbers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Paul Donofrio</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone. Since Brian covered the income statement, I will start with the balance sheet on page five. As you know, when general deposit flows drive the size of our balance sheet, and they on a lending basis were relatively flat this quarter as inflows were partially offset by outflows to fund seasonal tax payments. So total assets were stable compared to Q1 with loans increasing modestly, security balances rising and cash down a corresponding amount.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Liquidity also saw a small decline. However, we remain well compliant with LCR requirements. Tangible common equity of $170 billion improved by $3.6 billion from Q1, driven by earnings and OCI. This was partially offset by 1.1 billion in share repurchases and roughly 500 million in common dividends. As a reminder, following the CCAR results we announced an increase in both our share repurchase authorization as well as a planned increase of 50% in our quarterly dividend. On a per share basis, tangible book value per share increased to $16.68, up 11% from Q2 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to regulatory metrics, as a reminder, we report capital under the advanced approaches. Our CET 1 transition ratio under Basel III ended the quarter at 10.6%. On a fully phased-in basis, CET 1 capital improved $4.3 billion to $161.8 billion. Under the advanced approaches compared to Q1 2016, the CET 1 ratio increased seven basis points to 10.5% and is above our current 2019 requirement. RWA declined roughly 13 billion, driven by reductions related to retail exposures primarily from credit improvement.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We also provide our capital metrics under the standardized approach. Here our CET 1 ratio improved to 11.4%. Supplementary leverage ratio for both parent and bank continue to exceed U.S. regulatory minimums that take effect in 2018.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Turning to slide six and on an average basis, total loans were up 7 billion from Q1 and 23 billion or 3% from Q2 2015. On an ending period basis, loan growth this quarter was impacted by pay-downs near the end of the quarter and the non-U.S. corporate loan facilities and about 1.6 billion in FX translations across international loans, including the K Card [ph]. Note on the slide, there is a breakdown of the loans in our business segments and all other. Again, on an average basis year-over-year, loans and all other were driven by 42 billion driven by continued runoff of first and second main mortgages while loans in our Business segments were up 65 billion or 9%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">In Consumer Banking we continued to see strong growth in consumer real estate and vehicle lending, offset somewhat by runoff in home equity outpacing originations. In Wealth management, we saw growth in consumer real estate and structured lending. Global banking loans were up 35 billion or 12% year over year and up 7% annualized from Q1. Deposits were stable with Q1 at 1.2 trillion, but grew 67 billion or 6% from Q2 2015. Broad-based growth was led by consumer, increasing more than 44 billion or 8% year over year, while wealth management deposits grew 6% and deposits with corporate clients and global banking improved nearly 4%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Turning to asset quality on slide seven, we saw improvement from Q1. Total net charge-offs improved 83 million from Q1 to less than 1 billion in Q2. Consumer losses declined modestly across a number of products, and while slight commercial losses also declined from Q1 as a result of lower energy losses, provision of 976 million in Q2 was down $21 million from Q1. Finally, we had a small overall net reserve release in the quarter as consumer releases were modestly offset by builds in commercial.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On slide eight, we provide credit quality data on our consumer portfolio. Net charge-offs declined $68 million from Q1. While driven by lower real estate losses, the improvement, as I mentioned, was broad-based. Over half of the losses in this book are U.S. credit card, where the loss rate improved five basis points from Q1 to 2.66%. Delinquency levels and NPLs improved and reserve coverage remains strong.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Moving to the commercial credits on slide nine, net charge-offs improved $15 million from Q1 as energy losses declined. Energy charge-offs decreased $23 million from Q1 to $79 million this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">There isn\u2019t a lot of new news on the commercial asset quality front other than the modest improvement in our energy-related exposure. As you all know, the price of oil and gas was more stable in Q2. Within this backdrop, we experienced some improvement in both energy losses and exposure. A few clients refinanced with equity issuances and other financing solutions, which also helped improve exposures.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Overall, our committed energy exposure declined $3 billion from Q1, with utilized exposure declining more modestly and exposure to exploration and production as well as oilfield services, which we believe are the two higher-risk subsectors, declined 1% from Q1.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Outside of energy, commercial asset quality continues to perform well. Let me share with you a few metrics that exhibit the quality of this book and its performance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">The reservable criticized exposure ratio is 3.8%, and excluding energy, metals and mining, exposure is 2.4%, which is near pre-recession levels. The commercial net charge-off ratio excluding small business has been below 15 basis points for 14 consecutive quarters, even with the elevated levels of energy charge-offs we experienced over the past three quarters. The NPL ratio which today is at 37 basis points has been below 40 basis points for 11 consecutive quarters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Turning to slide 10, net interest income on a reported non-FTE basis was $9.2 billion. Included in NII this quarter was a negative $974 million market-related adjustment to true-up bond premium amortization. This follows Q1\u2019s more negative adjustment of $1.2 billion, and it\u2019s important to note that the adjustment in Q2 2015 was a benefit of $669 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">NII on an FTE basis excluding market-related adjustments was $10.4 billion. This was lower than Q1 primarily due to lower long end rates and Q1\u2019s seasonal impacts. Compared to Q2 2015, results were up nearly $400 million, or 4%, as higher short end rates combined with loan growth funded by deposits offset the negative impact of lower long end rates.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Looking forward to Q3, we will benefit from an extra day which will be offset by the impact of declines in long end rates over the past two quarters and put pressure on our MBS bond yields and reinvestment yields more generally. As we get into Q4 and the next year, we get more optimistic about NII, assuming both the current forward curve and the current pace of loan and deposit growth.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">With respect to asset sensitivity, as of 6/30, an instantaneous 100 basis point parallel increase in rates is estimated to increase NII by $7.5 billion over the subsequent 12 months driven by the increase in long end rates.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Now we think it\u2019s also important to understand what we expect to happen to NII if rates don\u2019t rise. Referring to the bottom left of the slide, the adjusted NII has been fairly stable, averaging between $10.3 billion and $10.4 billion over the past five quarters. If we have stability in long end rates, we would expect to maintain that level in the near-term, again, assuming modest loan and deposit growth. Rates moving up or down from here would obviously impact that perspective slightly in the near-term, but building as we extend that scenario into future quarters and years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Turning to slide 11, noninterest expense was $13.5 billion in the quarter. That is a half a billion dollars or 3% lower than Q2 2015 driven by good expense discipline across the company. As you can see, we are presenting expenses a little bit differently now that we have eliminated the LAS segment. Having said that, we made steady progress on reducing legacy loan servicing costs this quarter and we still expect to achieve our original goal of lowering the former LAS segment costs ex-litigation to $500 million in Q4. Q2 litigation expense was $270 million which was higher by $95 million than Q1 2015, so year-over-year expense improvement ex-litigation was actually $600 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Nearly every category of cost was lower year-over-year. It was led by personnel including the expiration of the fully amortized advisor awards and the revenue related incentives mostly in wealth management. While the rest of the improvement I would characterize as just good, hard work, grinding expenses lower through SIM and other initiatives. While the rate of decline has been slowing, our employee base is down 3% from Q2 2015. As the employee base continues to go lower, we think it\u2019s important to point out that the reductions on a percentage basis now include more highly paid managerial associates.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So while the rate of FTE reduction has slowed, the relationship to expense reductions is not linear. Also, we continue to increase the number of client-facing associates to drive growth while at the same time through SIM and other efforts simplify and streamline activities and thereby reduce non-client-facing positions. Lastly, as I said last quarter, we expect our quarterly FDIC expense to increase approximately $100 million for a number of quarters starting in Q3 2016.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Turning to the business segments and starting with consumer banking on slide 12, consumer earned $1.7 billion, continuing its trend of solid improvement and reporting a robust 20% return on allocated capital. Revenue and earnings were driven by deposit and loan growth coupled with continued expense improvement driving operating leverage. As a result of this operating leverage, the efficient ratio improved roughly 360 basis points year-over-year. Note that the lack of reserve releases this quarter versus a meaningful release last year mitigated some of the improvement in the operating leverage. So while earnings were up 3% year-over-year, pre-tax pre-provision earnings rose 11%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">On slide 13, we focus on additional key consumer banking trends. First on the upper left, the stats are a reminder of our strong competitive position. Revenue increased by 107 million and NII growth more than offset lower noninterest income. Net interest income continued to improve as we drove deposits and loans higher. Noninterest income was down due mostly to lower mortgage banking income. This decline is in part a result of selling fewer loans and instead holding more on our balance sheet, thereby shifting mortgage banking income to NII. Expense declined 5% from Q2 2015. The positive expense trend is a result of a number of initiatives.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">As an example, I would note that our growth to mobile banking continues to play an important role in helping us optimize our delivery network while improving customer satisfaction. Our cost of deposits as a percentage of average deposits also continued to improve and now stands at 162 basis points. Focusing on client balances on the bottom of the page, Merrill Lynch broker assets at $132 billion or up 8% versus Q2 2015 on strong account flows partially offset by lower market valuations. We increased the number of Merrill Lynch customers by 10% from Q2 2015. We now have more than 1.6 million households using our platform for self-directed trading.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Moving across on the bottom right of the page, note that loans are up 5% from Q2 2015 on strong mortgage and vehicle lending growth. Average vehicle loans are up 20% from Q2 2015 with average booked FICO scores remaining well above the 770 level and net losses remaining below 30 basis points and improving on a linked quarter basis. Mortgage loan growth was aided by solid mortgage production of $16 billion, up modestly from Q2 2015, as customers took advantage of historically low interest rates. On consumer card \u2013 or I should say on U.S. Consumer Card, we issued more than 1.3 million cards in the quarter, which is the highest level since 2008. Average balances were modestly down; however, adjusting for divestitures, average card balances grew $1.4 billion compared to Q2 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Spending on credit cards adjusted for divestitures was up 7.5% compared to Q2 2015. As we viewed in previous quarters, we continue to focus on originating high FICO loans which generally produce low loss rates and strong risk adjusted margins.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Last quarter, we highlighted the quality of our underwriting in the consumer business. This quarter, we\u2019re highlighting our leading position in digital banking. This technology continues to reshape how our customers bank. Importantly, as adoption rises, particularly around transaction processing and self-service, we see improved efficiency and customer satisfaction. We added more than 2.5 million new mobile customers in the past 12 months. With more than 20 million active users, deposits from devices now represents 17% of deposit transactions. Mobile customers on average process 280,000 deposits per day, an increase of 28% year-over-year and the equivalent to volume of 800 financial centers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Mobile sales are up nearly 50% from last year. We\u2019re promoting mobile sales and electronic adoption by deploying digital ambassadors in our financial centers. We now have more than 3,500 digital ambassadors in our branches engaging with customers who come into the branch to transact. They educate these customers on alternatives to branch banking, which are not only more convenient for them but also more efficient for us. Digital sales, appointments and satisfaction all continue to achieve new highs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Also as you know, we are a leader in person-to-person and person-to-business money movement through digital transfers and bill payment capabilities. The adoption and popularity of these capabilities continues to drive growth with record volume of $246 billion this quarter, up nearly 5% year-over-year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Turning to slide 15. Global Wealth and Investment Management produced earnings of $722 million, up 8% from Q2 2015. Year-over-year, revenue was down modestly but expenses were down even more, improving pre-tax margin to 26%, up meaningfully from Q2 2015. This quarter included a modest gain from the previously announced sale of Bank of America Global Capital Management. This reduced AUM comprised of short-term liquid assets by approximately $80 billion. Overall, revenue declined 2% from Q2 2015, as strong NII growth and the gain were more than offset by lower market-sensitive revenue.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Asset management revenues declined from Q2 2015 on lower market values while improving modestly on a linked-quarter basis. Transactional revenue was down and continues to be impacted by market uncertainty as well as the migration of activity from brokerage to managed relationships. NII benefited from solid deposit and loan growth. Non-interest expense declined nearly $200 million or 6% from Q2 2015, with half of that benefit derived from the expiration of the amortization of advisor retention awards that were put in place at the time of the Merrill Lynch merger. The rest of the improvement was a result of lower revenue-related incentives and other support costs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Moving to slide 16. Despite volatile markets, we continued to see overall solid client engagement. Client balances at $2.4 trillion were down from Q1; but excluding the sale I mentioned earlier were up from Q1, as higher market valuation levels, $10 billion of long-term AUM flows and loan growth more than offset tax-related deposit outflows.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Driven by the expected seasonality, average deposits were down from Q1 as clients paid income taxes. Importantly, average deposits are up 6% from Q2 2015, driven by growth in the second half of 2015. Average loans also grew this quarter. Growth was concentrated in consumer real estate and structured lending as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Turning to slide 17. Global Banking earned $1.5 billion, producing solid improvement over both Q1 and year-over-year. Returns on allocated capital was 16%, a 200 basis point improvement from Q2 2015, despite adding $2 billion in allocated capital. Double-digit percent revenue growth year-over-year offset a low single digit expense growth creating strong operating leverage that improved the efficiency ratio to 45%. Global banking continues to drive solid loan growth within its risk and client frameworks producing solid year-over-year improvement in NII. Revenue benefited this quarter from mark-to-market gains on our FBO loan portfolio due to recovery in certain energy and mining exposures. Higher Treasury fees and leasing gains also aided the improvement from Q2 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">While total investment banking fees for the firm were down from Q2 2015, global banking gained a little share supported by M&amp;A fees which were up on an absolute basis. A modest increase in noninterest expense compared to Q2 2015 reflects the cost of adding sales professionals over the past 12 months and a modest increase in incentive related due to do the higher revenue.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Looking at trends on page 18, and comparing Q2 last year, clients were comforted \u2013 excuse me, clients were confronted with increased volatility once again this quarter, with concerns around both global growth as well as the outcome of the U.K. referendum. However, despite concerns, companies still need to finance as well as store and move their money, and this is when the strength and diversity of our franchise is most appreciated by our clients. Average loans on a year-over-year basis grew $35 billion or 12%. Growth was broad-based across large corporates as well as middle market borrowers and spread across most products. Having said that, we slowed our construction-led commercial real estate lending a few quarters ago. Average deposits increased from Q2 2015, up 11 billion or 4% from both new and existing clients.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Switching to global markets on slide 19, the past couple of quarters are great examples of the importance of this segment to not only its clients around the world but also to our customers and clients in all our business segments. Customers and clients were able to live their financial lives better in Q2 because global markets delivered for them under challenging market conditions, helping them raise capital, buy and sell securities, as well as manage risk. We believe we increased our relevance with clients during Q2 and more specifically during the market volatility after the U.K. referendum. We did this by showing them that we will be there for them when they need us most. That we are there for them with consistent set of products and services at terms that make sense for our clients and our shareholders.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And therefore, then, with thoughtful advice as well as the capabilities, strength, and confidence to make markets and execute, all of this resulted in global markets reporting earnings of $1.1 billion and a return on capital of 12%, 13% excluding net DVA impact. Revenue was up appreciably year-over-year as well as linked quarter. Total revenue excluding DVA was up 8% year-over-year on solid sales and trading results and up 18% over a Q1 that saw challenging market conditions. Strong expense management drove expenses 6% lower year-over-year even while revenue was higher.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Moving to trends on the next slide, and focusing on the components of our sales and trading performance, sales and trading revenue of $3.7 billion excluding net DVA was up 12% from Q2 2015 driven by FICC. In terms of revenue, this was the best second quarter we have had in the past five years. Excluding DVA and versus Q2 2015, FICC sales and trading of $2.6 billion increased 22% as the improvement which began in late Q1 continued through Q2 as global concerns abated and central banks took further monetary policy actions. Improvement was across both macro and credit products driven by stronger rates and currency, client activity as well as improved credit market conditions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Tighter spreads benefited mortgage, trading and municipal bonds outperformed treasuries with strong retail demand. Equity sales and trading was $1.1 billion, declining 8% versus Q2 2015 which saw significant client activity in Asia driven by stock market rallies in the region.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">On slide 21, we show all other which reported a loss of $815 billion. This loss was driven by the current quarter\u2019s $974 million market related NII adjustment. The loss is lower than Q1 due to both a lower market related NII adjustment as well as the absence of retirement-eligible incentive costs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Compared to Q2 2015, the difference is driven by a number of factors. First, the negative NII market-related adjustment in this quarter versus a large positive adjustment in Q2 2015. Second, we had reps and warranty recoveries in Q2 2015 related to a court ruling and gains on the sale of consumer real estate loans. Third, provision expense declined from Q2 2015 driven by continued portfolio improvement.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">The effective tax rate for the quarter was about 29%, which is in-line with what we expect for the remainder of the year, absent any unusual items. And as a reminder, we still expect to record a tax charge of about $350 million, most likely in 3Q that reduces the carrying value of our U.K. DTAs as a result of the U.K. tax reform announced last year. The vast majority of this charge will not impact regulatory capital.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. So let me offer a few takeaways as I finish. Q2 was another quarter of solid progress in a challenging global environment. While growth concerns persist in many countries, the U.S. economy continues to steadily improve, albeit at a less than optimum pace. The diversity and strength of our franchise makes us more relevant to clients and customers during times such as these, and you can see that in our results.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Clearly, interest rates affected our financial performance this quarter. Still, while we cannot control interest rates, we are not waiting for them to rise. We grew in this environment by focusing on the things that we can control and drive. We grew deposits, we grew loans, we managed risk well, reflected in reduced charge-offs. We delivered for customer clients in another challenging quarter, especially around the U.K. referendum. We invested in our future by adding sales professionals and continuing to deploy technology that improves customer satisfaction. We returned capital to shareholders and we announced plans to return increasing amounts. And we did all of this while we lowered expenses and drove operating leverage</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Thank you. And with that, let\u2019s open it up for questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">[Operator Instructions]. We\u2019ll take our first question from Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O\u2019Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O\u2019Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I had a few follow ups on the expense commentary. I guess first, though, just maybe what drove the timing of giving a three-year expense outlook? Is it acknowledging kind of lower for longer rates? Is it finding more opportunities, or what was kind of the motivation to give expense outlook for 2018 at this point?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Well, Matt, as we looked at it, this is our current plan, so there\u2019s no new news for us in terms of how we operate the company. But what we saw is that people were not sort of getting the expenses right in the out years thinking that we could not continue the rate of investment and continue to bring down expenses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Secondly, to make sure people understood it in terms of blending in LAS and putting it into the base. It\u2019s now become less of the contribution and now it\u2019s more the general expense base we\u2019re working on. So I think it was consistent with the way we\u2019re running the company but we want to make sure that people had clarity over the next six quarters and going into 2018 of where we think the expense base goes versus what we saw in some of your guys\u2019 estimates and stuff.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O\u2019Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. And then I guess specifically, the $53 billion that you pointed to, does that include the first quarter stock expense of around a billion and some I assume nominal amount for legal?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yeah, it includes an estimate based on current views of both. That\u2019s all-in expenses for the year. Now they come in different quarters, as you just pointed out. We have it front-loaded of that, but \u2013 so this quarter did not include that I think it was about a quarter of a billion dollars plus a quarter when you think about the $13.5 billion this quarter. But overall, it includes the estimate for that out there plus the litigation estimate.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O\u2019Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. And then just separately, if I can ask, we\u2019ve had a couple other banks talk about loosening standards a bit on the consumer side. I feel like you\u2019ve held your standards quite high, especially in credit card. But just any thoughts on appetite for loosening standards a little bit here, given the challenging rate environment and the economy still hanging in there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We\u2019ve worked I think extraordinarily hard to transform the company, its balance sheet, its ability to produce earnings. We\u2019ve got a customer and risk framework on the consumer side that is focused on prime and super prime. That strategy, I think, works for our shareholders and our customers and we\u2019re sticking to it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And just to give you a simple view of that, Matt, this quarter we did the highest number of new credit card originations we\u2019ve done for a long time. And all of them are consistent with that risk appetite. So there\u2019s plenty of market share to gain there by just concentrating on current customers and deepening. And while people always ask the question you ask, the answer is there\u2019s still about seven out of 10 mortgage customers at Bank of America get their mortgage somewhere else that fit within our credit customers. There\u2019s plenty of cardholder that fit our credit parameters that are out there that don\u2019t have our card or aren\u2019t using our card as their primary card. And so just giving those couple of examples, there\u2019s plenty of market share to get there. So we don\u2019t need to change the standards to grow and you\u2019re seeing that come through.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O\u2019Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. Thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And we\u2019ll take the next question from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Hey. Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Maybe I could follow up a little bit on the NII discussion. Maybe if you could help us think through \u2013 you talked about near-term kind of flattish, but as we think a little bit longer term, if the forward curve is realized and/or maybe give some color. You\u2019ve had good deposit growth, core loan growth of 9% but net loan growth\u2019s only been about 2.5%. Do we start to see that inflect more? And does that start to help the out years as well? So just any color on NII beyond the next quarter or two would be helpful.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Sure. Look, as I said in my comments, if rate follow the current path of the forward curve, we would expect with the extra day and the client long-term rates to be at around a $10.4 billion range in the next quarter. So...</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Right.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">But as you get out to 4Q and next year, I think we get more optimistic about being able to grow, given just our current pace of deposit and loan growth. We\u2019ve obviously experiencing good deposit growth. We\u2019ve got, as we talked about, a strong risk in client framework, so we\u2019d like to put all of that deposit growth into loan growth. But we\u2019re going to only do so if it meets our criteria. Whatever deposit growth doesn\u2019t get absorbed by good loans with our clients obviously goes into the investment portfolio and we get a return there. So I think, look, it\u2019s just a question of the further you get out, the more that wave of deposits and asset growth kind of overwhelms the change in interest rates and we see growth.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Also if you look at page six, you can see that \u2013 a point you made is that the inflection point was hit a few quarters ago where the sort of the non-core loans and leases were running down and not being made up by growth. We\u2019ve passed that. And so as we think about it going forward, in the upper right-hand part of page six, you can see that other loan and leases balances coming down. They\u2019ll continue to come down but there\u2019s just less of them. And then if you look at the lower left, you see the core loans are growing at a good rate, have been growing a good rate now can come through. So I think your point about what give us encouragement because you saw it last year second quarter, this year second quarter about how even in a lower for longer rate environment we can grow NII is that you\u2019re actually are growing the net loan book pretty consistently now each quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So I guess you don\u2019t want to put too many numbers around it. But should we think that maybe starting in 4Q or 1Q, we might start to see some incremental NII growth; and maybe that accelerates \u2013 as you point out, the loan growth overwhelms the rate picture?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I think we\u2019d say that you got to be careful about your rate scenario, even on a spot basis because it can move around and move that around. But think about it as second quarter next year, you\u2019d start to see this breakthrough again, based on absolutely no change in rates from the low point they were.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Right. Okay. Great. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And we\u2019ll take the next question from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ken Usdin</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Hey. Good morning, guys. Just one. On the fee side, you mentioned all the great metrics in terms of the growth of activity and account growth and whatnot. But we\u2019re continuing to see declines year-over-year in card income, service charges and the brokerage business. So I was wondering, you can walk us through when do you anticipate some of the, kind of the building blocks turning into revenue? Or are there still some of the \u2013 kind of the spending or kind of competitive pressures building in underneath? So just kind of the outlook for some of those kind of core consumer and brokerage-related fee areas would be great. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. Well, let\u2019s start with card. I think card actually is up on a linked-quarter basis, down year-over-year. But you have to remember, again, we had portfolio divestitures. So I think we\u2019re at the point now, we\u2019re not going to be seeing those sorts of divestitures in the future. And we start feeling better about more consistent growth around card.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">If you look at brokerage income, we have been in a multi-quarter, trend of people shifting from brokerage to more managed accounts. That trend has obviously put pressure on the revenue line because at the same time that was going on, we had had a lot of volatility in the marketplace, lower overall capital markets, lower overall activity. But I think over time as \u2013 if capital markets continue to rise, we will get \u2013 we will offset that decline in transactional revenue.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">[Audio gap] in terms of FA attrition? And then the second part is in Wealth Management, what specific products or behavioral changes are you putting in place ahead of the DOL rules kicking in in April?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So on the first quarter, we haven\u2019t seen any change in attrition after retention. And most of the retention \u2013 most of the attrition experienced financial advisors have been more due to our change in our way we do the international business, which has been going on for about a year. But in terms of aggregate numbers, it\u2019s been relatively stable. In terms of the attrition we see is actually in the lower production levels, mainly due to people not being able to kind of build a book of business. And we\u2019re trying to fix that through the integrated business system with our consumer and preferred teams.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">In terms of DOJ and the fiduciary standard, we\u2019re visibly implementing this. It\u2019s consistent with where we\u2019re going with the business. It\u2019s consistent with the move from an old view of what financial advisory was versus a managed money fee-based, loaded with a financial planning driven business. Admittedly it\u2019s a little tricky, because the actual rules only apply to the $200-odd billion of 401(NYSE:<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/K\" title=\"Kellogg Company\">K</a>) and retirement assets we have, but it\u2019s consistent with where we\u2019re taking the business and the team drawing we don\u2019t see meaningful revenue or changes due to that. We\u2019ll see meaningful changes to implemented, but not meaningful revenue changes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. I appreciate that. And just a follow-up on the 2018 expense target, which everyone appreciates, it might be a silly question, but should \u2013 is it safe to assume that 2017 will be somewhere between 2016 and actual in 2018\u2019s target?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Well, we\u2019ve got \u2013 yes, it\u2019s a safe assumption. It\u2019s not a silly question. But we\u2019ve got six quarters between now and then, and you can see what we\u2019re running at now to get it down to that level. It will take work every quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. Thanks, Brian.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">We\u2019ll take the next question from Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Hi. Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So I hate to beat a dead horse on the expense question, but, Brian or Paul, I was hoping you could provide some more detail as to what specific expense levers you can pull to really drive that figure to 53 billion? It is a pretty meaningful delta versus the 56 billion run rate over the last four quarters. I\u2019m just trying to gauge how those expense initiatives might impact revenues? And whether we should expect any revenue attrition as those additional initiatives take hold?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Sure. So let me just back up a little bit. I will definitely answer your question, but I want to emphasize again, we\u2019re talking about LTM 56 billion going to 53 billion, absorbing in that merit, healthcare, inflation and other investment. And the first thing I would point out as you sort of think about the credibility of that, look at what we accomplished over the last five years. From Q2 2011 to Q2 2016 we have reduced quarterly expenses by $4.8 billion. That\u2019s a $19 billion annualized run rate. And we did this by not only reducing legacy mortgage related expenses, which were only make up $2 billion of that $4.8 billion, but just through good expense management in every major category across the company.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So from here it\u2019s about a number of things. A lot of those things have been identified through our simplify and improve initiative. We\u2019re investing in technology and capabilities to improve efficiency. The most obvious example of that you can see is in the increasing adoption of customers for digital channels. But I do want to emphasize that it is, you know \u2013 it is about making progress across the entire company from our leaders and our teams. So if you look in consumer, they\u2019re an example of the digital adoption. We\u2019ve got mobile users of 15% over 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">When they make a deposit, that\u2019s one-tenth the cost. We\u2019ve got digital sales up 12% year-over-year. We\u2019ve got more customers using digital statements, a lot more work to do there with transition from paper to electronic. We are optimizing the coverage model in both consumer and GWIM, and they all have goals. We all have goals and initiatives around controllable expenses including travel, supply, support costs. If you look at global banking and global markets, we\u2019re simplifying our legal entity structure and business model. We\u2019re integrating wholesale credit origination and processing across the lines of business. We\u2019re centralizing data platforms. We\u2019re expanding electronic capabilities and we\u2019re optimizing the coverage model. So, you know, there\u2019s a lot going on and we\u2019re going to need all of it to get to our goals</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. So, Paul, from based on your comment, it sounds like it\u2019s really going to be driven by technology and other efficiency initiatives. So there shouldn\u2019t be any expectation that we could see any meaningful revenue drop-off or attrition in light of those actions that you\u2019re taking?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I think Paul gave you a lot of different places it comes from, but I think you have to back up and say it comes from reducing the expense base and by people. And you can see that even in markets, year-over-year we\u2019re down 7% and people revenue went up. So it\u2019s electronification of fixed income platform and the equity\u2019s platform continue down that road. So every single area is moving here and then if you also have to think about the stability of the platform, this company has now been operating with a consistent strategy and a consistent ability to execute for many years. And what\u2019s gone with the legacy and stuff that just allows us to keep operating on ourselves. And we always have performed best in history when we had that period of time no acquisitions, no divestitures, no legacy asset servicing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So we\u2019re very confident that it will happen. On revenue, I\u2019d say look at it year-over-year, look at it linked quarter so last three or four quarters you\u2019re seeing revenue is stable and well bounces around with market activity in a given quarter. The core revenue continues to go forward and the expenses keep coming down on a core basis. So we\u2019re comfortable that there\u2019s nothing \u2013 we won\u2019t allow our people and our responsible growth to give us cost saves and not grow the business. So it has to be sustainable. It has to be actually taking out real work and yet still investing in more client-facing teammates, more salespeople and more technology capability for customers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">We\u2019ll take the next question from Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go head.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Thanks. Just a couple of questions on auto and then one clarification on the OpEx guidance. I\u2019m sorry to come back to that but on the OpEx, is it the 2018 figure where you expect to begin 2018 or end 2018?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">That\u2019s for the full year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">For the full year. On auto, you underscored the origination quality and the high end of the FICO range, but one of the things that we\u2019re hearing from dealers is, is about the compression and pricing that\u2019s occurring in the high end ranges, some other lenders move up out of the mid-FICO range. And I wanted to see if that\u2019s something that you think you\u2019re experiencing or if you\u2019re in fact seeing some stabilization in the competitive area around high FICO auto lending.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I would say we haven\u2019t experienced that. We can check and get back to you. I would \u2013 I would just make a couple more comments about auto. We are \u2013 we\u2019re maintaining our share, but we are very focused on the prime and super prime. And as we pointed out last quarter, we\u2019re booking these loans at FICO scores of around 70, 74. We\u2019ve got debt-to-income at all-time lows, and importantly, we are not from a structuring standpoint extending kind of way we see in the marketplace.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">We\u2019ll take the next question from Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Hi. Still more on expenses. This might be good news bad news. I guess the good news is your expenses over the last year, branches are down 2%, FTE down 3%, almost every expense line is lower. So that\u2019s good. And your efficiency ratio is down to 62%. But the bad news the way I look at it is over the last five years, your expenses are down a lot, but your core revenues are down even more. So what might resolve at least the issue in my mind? Do you have a specific efficiency target for 2018?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Well, Mike, the \u2013 if you look at the risk adjusted revenue, you would come to a different conclusion. So, yes, we had a lot of revenue in 2011 or 2012, but the charge-offs were running tens of billions of dollars more a year than we have now. So a lot of that revenue was just going off the back end. So if you look at it from a risk adjusted basis, I think we grew from a low 60s to the low 80s over the last five or six years. So that is actually the work that gets done. So we could \u2013 going back a point, we focus on very high credit quality so we keep that credit cost moving in the right direction or stable when the world has gone a different way. We don\u2019t have a target efficiency ratio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">You can calculate on of that out in 2018 because as we talked about earlier, the NII differences will be driven by where rates go to some degree. But the idea is we are going to take expenses from $56 billion in the last four quarters to $53 billion and we think that\u2019s where we\u2019ll get them to. And if rates stay stable or go up a little bit, you\u2019ll see a lower efficiency ratio. Right now, we\u2019re running about 62% this quarter fairly stated and we think we can push it down from here.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And I don\u2019t want to take away \u2013 I think we collectively appreciate having a 2018 expense target, but if you just take the second quarter annualized, you\u2019re at $54 billion, and then if you reduce your LAS expenses, you kind of get down to a $53 billion number. So if...</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Mike, you\u2019re missing the FAS 123 and social security, which is $1.2 billion in the first quarter that doesn\u2019t occur this quarter but you\u2019ve got to add that back too.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And you said a lot is anything on, and I think some other analysts tried to restate what you\u2019re saying. But what are the three biggest drivers then of that reduction of what you might term a core expense base?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">It\u2019s then people. We\u2019re down 2,600 people quarter over quarter. It\u2019s a constant reduction in personnel through hard work and automation while we\u2019re continuing to increase the investment in salespeople. And so that helps on the revenue side and the revenue equation versus expense. It\u2019s the things like our data center configuration. We\u2019ve been in a program to take about a billion, billion and a half out of the data work, all the data centers and configuration that we\u2019re part way through. And in part it\u2019s just like Paul said, every line item is just grinding that. As we continue to bring down people, we have less occupancy, less telecommunications and everything else. So it really comes across the board.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And then lastly, should we expect a restructuring charge? Or do you pay as you go?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">We have consistently paid as we\u2019ve gone, as you well know, and even in every quarter we have between $50 million and $100 million of severance expense that we don\u2019t even talk bout.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">All right. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">The next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Vivek Juneja</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Hi. I won\u2019t beat the dead horse on expenses. Just a quick question on the card business. If I look at purchase volumes year on year, it slowed further from last quarter. Any color on what\u2019s going on there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yeah, I think purchase volumes are up 7% if you normalize for the divestitures.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Vivek Juneja</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. But the divestiture happened in 4Q. It slowed from where it was. It was up 2% year on year in the first quarter, and it slowed to 1% year on year in the second quarter. So it seems to me a little bit of a weakening trend.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I think we\u2019ve had divestitures in 2Q last year and in the fourth quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Vivek Juneja</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I know. I am [indiscernible]. Those were both reflected in 1Q 2016 year on year growth rates. And I\u2019m comparing growth rates...</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Let me just make it simple for you. The year-to-date through July is up \u2013 taking out divestitures, up 4% on debit and credit both and up 7% on credit card purchases normalized for divestitures year to year the first six months plus this part of July. So it\u2019s growing fine.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Vivek Juneja</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. Got it. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">We\u2019ll go next to Paul Miller with FBR and Company. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">PaulMiller</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yeah, thank you very much. On the LAS, so you now consolidate the LAS segment into pretty much the consumer segment. You still \u2013 the last on the appendix you said you had about 11,000 workers in that area where I guess continue to work through about 88,000 loans. Is that number \u2013 should that number continue to move down? Will we continue to see that move down? Or what\u2019s the thoughts behind that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Be careful because those 10,000 people work on the 88,000 loans plus the 3 million good loans. They service both good and not good loans, to make it simple. And so that\u2019s one of the reasons why we\u2019re separating. In all other going forward is the loans that we are actually only loans we\u2019d never do again and that we\u2019re running off 600,000, 700,000 units. Moved into the segments whether it\u2019s consumer, U.S. trust, or Merrill Lynch are the loans that relate to their businesses in terms of servicing costs, too. So that was one of the confusions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">As this thing got down, you got the point where the good servicing costs are becoming a more meaningful part of the total. It\u2019ll continue on, because that portfolio, whether it\u2019s direct servicing costs for third parties or even the stuff on the balance sheet, will continue.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">But to give you a sense, from first quarter, second quarter, we\u2019re down the total head-count of about 2,600. About 900 and change came from LAS from the servicing side. So it still contributes, but its contribution is going down each quarter, because the amount left to service the good stuff and just generally service our portfolio will be a higher percentage of what\u2019s left.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Paul Miller</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. And then you gave some guidance on where you think LAS expenses will be by the fourth quarter. And I\u2019m not sure I wrote it down correctly, and I might have misinterpreted it, but was it close to 500 million you said? Or am I off somewhere?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yeah, so this quarter we ran about 600 and we said we\u2019d get \u2013 a long time ago we said we\u2019d get to 500 by the fourth quarter this year. So we\u2019re almost there, and the idea is that will be completed.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Paul Miller</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So is 500 the run rate to service the good loans? I\u2019m confused. Or is that still servicing the bad loans?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Both.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Paul Miller</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Both. Okay. Thank you very much, guys.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">The next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Good morning. Sorry to come back here, but I just hate horses. So I\u2019m anything to take another whack at this thing. On expenses, what should we think about as far as your assumptions for legal and then some of your market-related businesses, market-sensitive businesses GOM and markets? Just because the expense line items in those businesses do have a pretty big impact from market conditions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So I\u2019ll start with legal. From a legal perspective, if you look over the last four, five, six, seven quarters, we\u2019ve been running around 300 million per quarter. We did 270 this quarter. You know, that I feel like is a reasonable range if you\u2019re building a model for the near term.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And in terms of the Capital Markets businesses, I\u2019m not quite sure I get your question. Obviously they are \u2013 that line is tied to the performance of the business. The total performance of the business, returns, earnings and revenue, and we have \u2013 we have programs in place that we think are competitive with what\u2019s on Wall Street so that we can attract the best of talent and retain the best of talent. We\u2019re constantly benchmarking against those programs, and we feel like we\u2019re where we should be for the quality and the market presence we have in those areas.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Q \u2013 Brennan Hawken</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Overall, you should think about the environment we\u2019re talking about is an environment consistent where we are now from growth of 1.5%, 2% of U.S. GDP and stuff. So it doesn\u2019t contemplate any change in the current environment from just a general operating principle.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Again, remember what I think Brian said and what I emphasized again, that 53 billion is absorbing increases in merit, absorbing increases in healthcare, investment that are just inflation that are just natural in the business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Right. I guess I was just \u2013 so you\u2019re saying that first of all on legal, the 53 billion includes roughly 300 million per quarter rate, and that your operating assumption for the GWIM and other market business would assume a revenue inflation and corresponding payout inflation from those businesses from here?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Yeah, based upon our current plan.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Got it. Got it. Got it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Within our current plan. And in terms of legal, I hope it\u2019s going to be less than 300 million when we get out there. I\u2019m not telling you to stick that in your model, but that\u2019s a good range to be thinking about.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay. That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you. And one quick follow up on GWIM, you guys highlight a gain on sale, but could you talk about how much that impacted the margins in that business? And then whether or not there was any EPS tailwind there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Yeah, it\u2019s \u2013 it was 80 billion of AUM again. That was all short-term. It had minimal impact on margins. Minimal.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">We\u2019ll go next to Matthew Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">MatthewBurnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Paul, I wanted to follow up on the mortgage banking side of things. That was one of the areas you highlighted in terms of potential growth. Year over year the mortgage banking revenue was down fairly substantially. It seems like a lot of that was hedging gains and losses and things like that. But you also mentioned that you\u2019re planning on keeping more mortgages that you originate on the balance sheet. Could you give us a little bit more color in terms of how you\u2019re thinking about that going forward, both in terms of the mortgage originations being kept in the balance sheet and sort of how you\u2019re thinking about mortgage banking fees?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Sure. Let me \u2013 you\u2019re right. MBI line was down year-over-year. That was planned for. We knew that was coming. I just want to walk \u2013 so for everybody else, I just want to walk through kind of why it\u2019s down and then we can talk a little bit about going forward. So kind of four items. First, we sold an appraisal business last year, so there was revenue in last year\u2019s second quarter that isn\u2019t in this quarter. Second, we had some servicing sales in the second quarter of last year for a gain that we didn\u2019t have this quarter. Third and probably most significant from a revenue perspective is that we have the ace decision in the second quarter last year, so we released last year some reps and warranties. That was a significant amount of benefit last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And then fourth and probably strategically most important in the point you\u2019re getting to is we are selling less mortgages choosing instead to hold them on our balance sheet, and obviously this decreases MBI but increases NII over time. So and plus you have to note that as we just talked about, servicing bad servicing is going to continue to run off. So if servicing is running off and not being replaced as fast, if we\u2019re holding more mortgages on the balance sheet as we transition from MBI to NII you could see that line continues sort of trend lower. In terms of the mortgages, you know, I think in the short-term, it\u2019s going to be fairly stable and that trend is going to this is a good base.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">This quarter is a good base to sort of start from. I think that trend lower is going to be, you know, in some quarters very slow because as you point out other items \u2013 other line items are a little bit messy and bounce around there depending on what happens with interest rates.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Right.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">But that\u2019s the trend. In terms of what we\u2019re trying to accomplish, all of the loans we originate that are nonconforming we would like to keep on our balance sheet. And even the conforming loans that have a certain characteristic we\u2019re going to be holding on our balance sheet. So right now that\u2019s around 75-ish percent of the loans we\u2019re originating are going on our balance sheet. Is that helpful?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Q \u2013 Matthew Burnell</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yes. Thanks. Thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And we\u2019ll go next to Richard Bove with Rafferty Capital. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Richard Bove</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Hi. I apologize for going back to the net interest income issue, but obviously the reason why central banks keep interest rates down is because they expect it to increase lending. And I\u2019m wondering if you have any elasticity studies which show what happens to loans when interest rates go down or up. And as part of that, there are multiple examples of what happens to earnings if interest rates go up 100 basis points or down. And I\u2019m wondering if you have done anything to show if interest rates remain flat and loans go up 2%, 5%, 6%, 8% what the impact on earnings would be.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yeah, absolutely. On that last part of your question is precisely what I think we\u2019ve been talking about today in the Q&amp;A and in the remarks. We\u2019ve got interest rates \u2013 we talked about interest rates following the forward curve. We talked about interest rates being flat. And despite both of those circumstances, we think in the out years we can grow NII or in the out quarters we can grow NII because we\u2019re growing deposits, and we\u2019re putting them to work where we can within our risk and client frameworks to grow well priced loans. Any amount of deposits that doesn\u2019t go to our clients and customers we\u2019re sticking in the securities portfolio and getting as much yield as we can get there within the constraints of liquidity and capital risk and interest rate risk.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">So we think we can grow in even a flat interest rate environment, grow the NII line not necessarily in the next quarter but as we again move out into the future. Brian has already pointed out all the work we\u2019re doing around expenses, so when you combine what we think we can do from a fee base, from an NII perspective and lowering expenses, we think we can grow earnings of a company even if interest rates are flat.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Richard Bove</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">What I\u2019m asking is a lot more specific in the sense that you do this with interest rate changes, right? In other words, there\u2019s these bubble charts which show what will happen to net interest income if interest rates go up 100 basis points. There\u2019s nothing which says what happens to earnings if you see a 5% increase in loans. In other words, what is more important? I mean, in the old days, people would show these charts if you hold interest rates flat and volume goes up, what happens to earnings if you get a 5% increase in lending as a result of interest rates staying so low?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Yeah, I get it, Dick. You\u2019re right. I mean, we tend to talk in our disclosures about interest rates moving 100 basis points, 50 basis points, and holding all else kind of equal what\u2019s in our plans.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">We could just as easily do the opposite. We could hold interest rates flat and then you could see the effect of deposit and loan growth. We certainly have that analysis. That\u2019s how we arrive at our perspective on the future. And I think if that\u2019s something that interests you, maybe after the call, we can kind of share with you some of that work. It\u2019s just math.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Richard Bove</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Yeah, no, the reason why I\u2019m interested is because the whole discussion that we now have is that interest rates are staying flat, and therefore, bank earnings cannot go up because the other side of the equation which is what happens to volume when interest rates go down is just not discussed at all. So I\u2019d love to talk to you more about it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Yeah, okay. That\u2019d be great.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay. Next we\u2019ll go to Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Oh, thanks. Just a quick follow up on the capital ratios. Paul, we saw a pretty big improvement across you and your peers in PP&amp;R on seemingly lower op risk hits, particularly legal. Do we start to see that factor into the advanced approach calculation? You guys get punished pretty hard on op risk in the advanced approach. Do you start to see some, I guess some light at the end of the tunnel of being able to reduce that, given all the reductions in legacy risk assets that you\u2019ve seen?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Thanks for noticing. So let me start by saying that we are very pleased with our results in CCAR this year. And we believe they really do reflect all the hard work we\u2019ve been putting into that process and improving capital planning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Operational risk, we have a third of our advanced RWA roughly is operational risk. And we would characterize most of that, Brian might say all of it, as for businesses we\u2019re no longer in, products that we no longer sell, and risk that I don\u2019t think we ever took as a basic Bank of America. So there\u2019s a lot of RWA sitting there, and we have to work overtime to show the regulators that we can get that down.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">But this \u2013 you\u2019re not \u2013 there\u2019s nothing to read into the results in CCAR yet anyway?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">No, I don\u2019t think so. I mean, obviously CCAR is on a standardized basis, so it doesn\u2019t incorporate operational risk.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">No, no. But in the PP&amp;R, they obviously made that point that...</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Yeah, you\u2019re right.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">You\u2019re right. I think they improved their models. I mean, I don\u2019t know, but I think we\u2019re all kind of looking at what they\u2019ve done and trying to understand it, and I think they probably improved their models a little bit around op risk and there was a little bit less across all the banks. I think the banks that had the most maybe benefited because it was more of an average type of thing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Right.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">So maybe we got a little extra benefit in that. But I don\u2019t know, to tell you the truth. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s in their models.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Right. So it\u2019s just a little too early to see any kind of spillover benefits yet?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">It appears we have no further questions at this time. I\u2019ll turn the program back over to our presenters for closing remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Thank you very much, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And this will conclude today\u2019s program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Lee McEntire</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning. Thanks to everybody on the phone as well as the webcast for joining us this morning for the Third Quarter 2016 Results. Hopefully everybody\u2019s had a chance to review the earnings release documents that were available on the website.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Before I turn the call over to Brian and Paul, let me remind you, we may make some forward-looking statements. For further information on those, please refer to either our earnings release documents, our website or our SEC filings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">One thing before Brian and Paul get into the results, I just want to remind you we file an 8-K on October 4, giving notification the company changed our method of accounting for the amortization of premium and accretion of discounts related to certain debt securities known by the investment community as FAS 91. Our change to the contractual method which is used by the just majority of our peers will provide better comparability of our results. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">As a result to the change, we restated our historical results, and provided the historically restated information in the 8-K and our earnings materials today naturally reflect those restatements. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">With that, let me turn it over to Brian Moynihan, our Chairman and CEO, for some opening comments; before Paul Donofrio, our CFO, goes through the details. Brian?</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you, Lee. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to review our third quarter results. Our results this quarter continue our progress on our long term strategy. We continue to drive responsible growth and deliver more of the company\u2019s capabilities to our clients and customers. This progress is becoming clear with each successive quarter, and you can see the highlights of that on slide 2. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We reported earnings of $5 billion or $0.41 per diluted share and EPS improvement of 8% from the year ago quarter. We improved operating leverage across the businesses, utilizing technology to lower costs and improve our processes. Our pretax earnings improved 17% compared to the third quarter of 2015. This pretax earnings comparison is important as it eliminates the unusual movements in the tax line like this quarters\u2019 tax charge and the UK corporate tax rate change. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Like last quarter, I thought I\u2019d address a few topics before hearing from all of you. To do that, let\u2019s look at slide 3 and 4 of the earnings material. The first question is, are we making progress driving our responsible growth strategy? Yes, we continue to show progress throughout all the businesses. Our revenue growth has more clarity as we move past the periods of significant impacts from implementing regulations, running off non-core portfolios, and divesting non-core businesses. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Revenue grew 3% over the third quarter of last year. Behind that improvement is our continued investment in this great franchise, in our sales teams, in our technology across the board. These sales teams and the buildup we\u2019ve been doing there help us to increase our capacity to serve our customers and clients. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">An example of that is in our consumer business, they are focused on being the core bank to all our households. This has resulted in fewer checking accounts than we had years ago, but the average balance of the checking accounts we have has doubled and they are now roughly $65 to $100 per account. You can also see this in the growth of our Merrill Edge brokerage balances, which now total over $138 billion, adding investment relationships to the mass market customer base. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In general, consumers are deepening their relationships with us, as they use our straight forward investing tools to get them started on a path to investing. For affluent and wealthy customers, our customer progress also continues. Our global wealth and investment management teams, US Trust and Merrill Lynch not only manage $2 trillion plus in investment balances, but also manage nearly $150 billion in loans and more than $250 billion in deposits, and we continue to see net flows of core assets in that business. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">On the commercial side, clients continue to respond to our universal banking model for a simplified stuff for financing, investing, and advisory services. We will continue to operate within in our established risk framework in defined customer groups and we aren\u2019t reaching for growth. This would drive more sustainable results over a longer period of time for our shareholders. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">And then with our global peers restructuring, including in the markets business, I think this quarter is another great example of how global markets business is important to our investing and issuing clients. We better client activity driving the best third quarter results we\u2019ve had in the five years in investment banking and in sales and trading, and we are doing that with a smaller balance sheet, fewer people, and lower value at risk or VAR. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">So growth in deepening, all consistent with our responsible growth strategy continues across all the customer bases. Paul will talk to you more about the statistics and its successes. Another question that we get asked is can credit remain this strong? Well many of you asked that last quarter and the quarter before that and the quarter before that. And in this quarter, it\u2019s still got better again with our charge-off ratio decline to 40 basis points this quarter at an historic low. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">This is driven by changes we made right after the crisis, thinking 2008 and 2009 and the long term benefits of that effort continue to come through. And by the way, sticking to our responsible growth strategy, even as times have been relatively better. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">US consumer health is generally good. Over the past few quarters, exposures in our oil and gas that were causing industry concerns for commercial losses have improved, and charge-offs have receded. Other commercial credit remains very strong and Paul will touch on these topics later. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Another question we get asked is, what can we do to drive earnings even if we stay in this low rate, low growth environment? We aren\u2019t waiting for interest rates to rise here at Bank of America. We are driving our earnings growth now. We work on the things that we can control, expenses, loan and deposit growth, and fee growth. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Long-term rates are down compared to last year, yet earnings have grown. Despite that, net interest income is up 3% from third quarter \u201915, while net interest yield has been stable because we grew core loans and deposits. Paul will take you through the loan growth details later, but I want to pause a moment and talk about our deposit growth.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Deposits are core part of what drives our franchise earnings. We have 1.2 trillion of deposits that\u2019s proof the customers entrust us to safeguard their money. We are heavily weighted and mix those deposits towards consumers, whether they are general consumers or wealthy consumers. This in turn provides a very stable base of funding for the company and allows us to be less relied on the markets we are funding. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Nearly $450 billion or 36% of our deposits are non-interest bearing, a very strong mix. Deposits on average grew $68 billion year-over-year or 6%. The teams have done tremendous work here, and this quarter wasn\u2019t an anomaly. This is the fourth quarter consecutive quarter where we have grown deposits more than $50 billion over the previous year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Our commercial teams remain focused on growing deposits also. They\u2019re growing deposits that are LCR friendly and doing great work with our industry leading cash management capabilities. As a result, year-over-year global banking grew their deposits 3% to 300 billion. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Our consumer and wealth management teams combine have $860 billion in deposits. They grew this large base by 8% in the past 12 months. For the first time, consumer tops $600 billion in deposits. These deposits are growing because our capabilities in the business are the best in the industry and our customers and clients see that. Whether it\u2019s our 21 million plus mobile banking customers, our 34 million plus online customers, or the more than 5 million customers that come in to our financial centers every week. These customers show that they appreciate the capabilities and integration of our network.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">So when we look at what else we can do to control and drive earnings in a low growth environment, we get asked a lot about expenses and can those expenses keep being driven down and go lower. Well the answer is yes. Last quarter we gave you a 2018 expense target and we continue to make progress towards that. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Our expenses declined 3% from the third quarter of 2015 to 2016. Our efficiency ratio improved 60% to 62% this quarter that is a 400 basis points improvement from last year\u2019s third quarter. We continue to deliver expense reductions while continuing to invest in technology and sales teams and other matters are important for the futures franchise. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">After taking in to account the addition of large bank FDIC assessment at the start of this quarter, expenses are also down on linked quarter basis, even as we continue to invest and absorb all the severance, regulatory, resolution planning and other repositioning cost to continue to reduce our operating cost. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We have been innovating in technology and will continue to do so to improve processes and eliminate the need for paper and humans handling that paper. Our simplified and improved initiatives continue to help drive those costs down, and that leads to the question we also get asked. Can we deliver and sustain returns above our cost of capital? </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">As Lee talked about earlier, we restate our results to change under FAS 91 and reduce the variability and make us more comparable to peers. As you can see that makes a little easier to see the longer term return on tangible common equity trends. This quarter we reported 10.3% and it is now stabilized above the cost of capital even given our larger and larger capital base. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We still have work to do here to drive to our ultimate goals, and this quarter is another strong step in that direction. And importantly on slide 4, you can see that each business has improved its leverage. They grew their earnings, had strong efficiency and return far above the cost of capital. And all that continues to bode as we look ahead. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">So as we look forward, we are driving responsible growth and maintaining discipline on cost, and this has allowed us to deliver more capital back to you, and we\u2019ll keep on doing that. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Now let me turn it over to Paul to cover the numbers. Paul?</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"><strong>Paul Donofrio</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Thanks Brian. Good morning everybody. Since Brian covered the income statement highlights, I will start with the balance sheet on page 5. Strong deposit growth drove a small increase in the size of our balance sheet versus Q2. Deposits rose 17 billion or 6% on an annualized basis. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">During the quarter, long term debt fell by 5 billion. We put cash to work growing securities in our investment portfolio and more modestly through loan growth. Global equity sources rose driven by the positive growth, and we remain well compliant with LCR requirements. Tangible common equity of 174 billion improved by 2.8 billion from Q2, driven by earnings. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In the process, we returned 2.2 billion to common shareholders through a combination of dividends and 1.4 billion in share repurchases. On a per share basis, tangible book value increased to $17.14, up $1.60 or 11% from Q3 \u201915. I would note that this increase was driven by both retained earnings, as well as share repurchases below tangible book value as we reduced shares 3% from Q3, \u201915. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to regulatory metrics, as a reminder we report capital under the advanced approaches. Our CET 1 transition ratio under Basel III end of the quarter at 11%. On a fully phased-in basis, CET 1 capital improved $4 billion to $166 billion. Under the advanced approaches compared to Q2 \u201916, our CET 1 ratio increased 40 basis points to 10.9% and is well above our 10%, 2019 requirement. RWA declined roughly 20 billion, driven by reductions in global markets exposures and improvements in credit quality, driven by run-off of non-core legacy exposure.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We also improved our capital metrics under the standardized approach. Here, our CET 1 ratio improved to 11.8%. Supplementary leverage ratios for both parent and bank continue to exceed US regulatory minimums to take effect in 2018.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to slide 6. On an average basis, total loans were up 23 billion or 3% from Q3 2015. And while up from Q2 \u201916, growth was at a slower pace. Consistent with past periods, we break out loans in our business segments and in all other. Year-over-year, loans in all other were down $30 billion, driven by continued run-off of first and second lien mortgages, while loans in our business segments were up $53 billion or 7%. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In consumer banking, we continue to see growth in residential real estate and vehicle lending offset somewhat by home equity pay-downs, which continued to outpace originations. In wealth management, we saw growth in residential real estate and structured lending. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Global banking loans were up 26 billion or 8% year-over-year. On the bottom right of the chart, note the growth of 68 billion in average deposits that Brian mentioned. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to asset quality on slide 7, we believe a number of factors including our strategy of responsible growth, enhanced underwriting standards since 2008, and a healthier economy have transformed the risk profile of Bank of America, as we look forward to future economic cycles. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Total net charge-offs of 888 million improved 97 million from Q2. Consumer losses declined across a number of products and commercial losses also declined, driven by lower energy losses. Driven by these improvements, provision expense of 850 million declined 126 million from Q2. We had a small overall net reserve release in the quarter as consumer real estate releases more than offset bills and other products. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On slide 8, we provide credit quality data on our consumer portfolio. We remain focused on originating consumer loans with borrowers with high FICO scores and our asset quality remained strong. Net charge-offs declined 71 million from Q2. This improvement was broadbased across consumer real estate as well as credit card. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Note that credit cards account for more than two-thirds of losses in our consumer portfolio, and within our US credit card book, the loss rate improved to 2.45%. NPLs improved and reserve coverage remained strong. Moving to commercial credit on slide 9, net charge-offs of 110 million improved 26 million from Q2. With respect to energy, exposures are down, losses improved, oil prices have stabilized and we have $1 billion of reserves. More specifically, energy charge-offs of 45 billion decreased 34 billion from Q2. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">While reservable criticized declined from Q2, we did experience an increase in NPLs this quarter, which concentrated with two clients, one in metals and mining and one in energy. Overall, our commercial portfolio continues to perform well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">As I shared with you last quarter, the metrics in the commercial portfolio speak for themselves in terms of quality and performance. The reservable criticized exposure declined and as a percentage of loans remains low. The commercial net charge-off ratio is 10 basis points. Excluding small business it is 5 basis points and it has been around 15 basis points or better for 15 consecutive quarters. And the NPL ratio remains low at 45 basis points.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Turning to slide 10, net interest income on a GAAP non-FTE basis was 10.2 billion, 10.4 billion on an FTE basis. As Lee mentioned earlier, we changed our accounting method for the amortization of premium or discount paid on certain of our debt securities from the prepayment method to the contractual method. The contractual method is used by our peers and should make it easier for investors to make comparisons. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Compared to Q3; \u201815, NII is up 3 million or 3%, as loan growth are shorter than rates and higher security balances funded by deposits more than offset the negative impact of generally lower long-end rates over the past several quarters. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Okay with respect to assets sensitivity as of 9/30, an instantaneous 100 basis point parallel increase in rates is estimated to increase NII by 5.3 billion over the subsequent 12 months. This is lower than the sensitivity we reported at June 30. The reduction was mostly on the long end, driven by the change to the contractual method and slower prepaid speed based upon on recent trends in customer behavior. Note that this sensitivity on the short end at 3.3 billion has not changed significantly. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Turning to slide 11, non-interest expense was 13.5 billion, that $0.5 billion lower or 3% lower than Q3 \u201915 driven cost reductions across the company. This is the initial quota of the increased FDIC assessment to show off the deposit insurance fund, the increase in expense for us is roughly a $100 million per quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Compared to Q2 \u201916, expenses were stable, as good core expense control was offset by the higher FDIC cost and modestly higher incentives. Q3 litigation expense was 250 million, which is fairly consistent with both Q3, \u201915 as well as Q2 \u201916. Most expense categories were lower year-over-year. This trend was led by personnel expense, which includes the Q4 \u201915 exploration of the full amortized advisor awards in wealth management. The rest of the improvement was driven by reduced cost of mortgage servicing coupled with same efforts in other initiatives. Our employee base is down 3% from Q2 \u201915. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">While the overall headcount is down, it\u2019s important to note that year-over-year we added over 1,000 primary sales associates across consumer, wealth management and global banking. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Turning to the business segments and starting with consumer banking on slide 12. Consumer earned 1.8 billion continuing its trend of solid results and reporting a robust 21% return on allocated capital. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">I would note that pre-tax, pre-provision earnings rose 377 million or 10%. Expense and NII improvement were both notable and together enough to more than offset higher provision expense and prior year divestiture gains. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Revenue was relatively flat on a reported basis compared to Q3 \u201915, as 4% growth in NII was offset as I said, by the absence of approximately 200 million of divestiture gains in Q3 \u201915. As a reminder these gains in Q3 \u201915 resulted from divestitures of an ancillary appraisal business, a card portfolio and some financial centers. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Excluding those prior period gains, revenue improved year-over-year and growth in pre-tax, pre-provisioned earnings was even more substantial. Falling 400 basis points, consumer banker\u2019s efficiency ratio of 55% improved meaningfully year-over-year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Turning to slide 13 and key trends, first on the upper left the stats are a reminder of our strong competitive position. Looking a little closer at revenue drivers compared to Q3 \u201915, net interest income continue to improve as we drove deposits higher. Average deposits continued their strong growth up 50 billion or 9% year-over-year, outpacing the industry. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">With respect non-interest income, service charges were up modestly, while card income was down. Spending levels and issuance were strong, but revenue growth was muted by customer rewards. We are attracting relatively higher quality card customers that on the one hand have higher spending habits, but on the other hand receive more awards. This has two important benefits to note; first, rewards deepen relationships, helping to grow deposits and make them more sticky for example. Second, in our experience, these customers have lower lost rates and a reduced need to interact with call centers, thereby allowing us to lower costs. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Turning to expenses, they declined 7% from Q3 \u201915 despite the higher FDIC assessment charges in the quarter. Expense reductions are the result of a number of initiatives. For example, mobile banking penetration helps to optimize our delivery network, while improving customer satisfaction. More chip cards help us lower fraud cost and digitization of processes and statements helps us eliminate paper and related handling cost. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">One can observe the impacts of these types of initiatives on the cost of deposits which continued its March lower dropping below 1.6% this quarter. Focusing on client balances on the left, in addition to deposit growth, Merrill Edge brokers assets at a 138 billion are up 18% versus Q3 \u201915 on strong account flows and market valuations. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We also increased the number of Merrill Edge accounts by 11% from Q3 \u201915. We now have nearly 1.7 million households that leverage our financial solution advisors and self-directed investing platform. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Moving across the bottom right of the page, note that loans are up 7% from Q3 \u201915 on strong mortgage and vehicle lending growth. As we viewed in previous quarters, we continue to focus on originating high FICO score loans, which have generally produced low loss rates and strong risk adjusted returns. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Loan growth included consumer real estate production of 20.4 billion, up 21% from Q3 \u201915 and in line with Q2 \u201916 as customers continue to take advantage of historically low interest rates. We retained about three quarters of first mortgage production on the balance sheet this quarter. Average vehicle loans were up 17% from Q3 \u201915 with average book FICO scores remaining well above 750 and net losses remaining below 30 basis points.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">With respect to US consumer card, average balances grew 7% from Q2 on an annualized basis, aided by seasonal backed school lending. We issued more than 1.3 million cards in the quarter and spending on credit cards adjusted for divestitures was up 8% compared to Q3 \u201915. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Turning to slide 14 in digital banking trends, as I mentioned earlier, we continue to see strong momentum in digital banking adoption with use across service, appointments and sales. Mobile banking in transforming how our customers bank and reshaping our consumer segment. Importantly as adoption rises, particularly around transaction processing and self-service, we see improved efficiency and customer satisfaction. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We continue to improve capabilities with the latest example being the launch of our Spanish mobile app which attracted over 800,000 active users in the first 10 weeks. We added roughly 1.1 million new mobile users in the quarter. The pace of user growth has increased despite an already impressive penetration rate of our check-in account holders. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">With more than 21.3 million active users, deposit from mobile devices now represents 18% of deposit transactions, and 26 million checks were deposited via mobile devices this quarter. That is an average of 280,000 deposits per day, an increase of 27% year-over-year and the equivalent to volume of 830 financial centers. Digital sales now represent 18% of total sales, and we now have more than 3500 digital ambassadors in our financial centers driving further adoption. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Also as you know, we are a leader in person-to-person and person-to-business money movement through digital transfers and bill payment capabilities. Consumers moved 243 billion in Q3 up 6% from last year, and while all this is transformative, I would just remind you that we still have a little less than 1 million per day walking in to our centers across the US. This in-person interaction is important in terms of deepening and retaining personal relationships, providing more complex financial help, and creating opportunities for further engagement. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Turning to slide 15, global wealth and investment management produced earnings of 697 million, up 10% from Q3 \u201915. Now it\u2019s no secret that this segment operates in an industry undergoing meaningful change as firms and clients adapt to the new fiduciary rules and other market dynamics. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">The good news is, we start from a position of strength with 2.5 trillion in client balances. We have market leading brands and a wide range of investment service offers from self-service to fully managed, plus we have the resources to continue to invest in market leading capabilities that address the changing needs of our clients. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Year-over-year, revenue is down modestly, but expenses were down even more improving pre-tax margin to 25%, up meaningfully from Q3 \u201915. Overall revenue declined 2% from Q3 \u201915, as NII growth was more than offset by lower transactional revenues. NII benefitted from solid loan and deposit growth, non-interest income declined from Q3 \u201915,driven lower transactional revenue that continues to be impacted by market factors as well as migration of activities from brokerage to managed relationships.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Non-interest expense declined nearly 313 million or 6% from Q3 \u201915, with half of that benefit derived from the exploration of the amortization of advisor retention award that were put in place at the time of the Merrill Lynch merger. The rest of the improvement was a result of work across many categories of expense, more than offsetting higher FDIC cost. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Moving to slide 16; we continue to see overall solid client engagement, client balances approached 2.5 trillion and are up from Q2 including higher market valuations, 10 billion of long term AUM flows and continued loan and deposit growth. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Average deposits compared against Q3 \u201915 are up 4%, driven by growth in the second half of 2015. Compared to Q2, average deposits were impacted by seasonal tax payments. Average loans were up 7% year-over-year, growth remained concentrated in consumer real estate and structured lending. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Lastly, earlier this month, we announced some innovations to our IRA products and services which we believe position us to better serve our clients, given new fiduciary rules. These innovations are industry-leading and address not only the new fiduciary rules for time and accounts, but also client preference for more choice and new ways to invest. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">First, we announced the roll-out of a new offering called Merrill Edge guided investing. This solution offers clients online investing, enhanced with professional portfolio management. With the addition of this solution, clients have three fundamental choices which they can mix and match to best meet their needs. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Clients can invest online, completely self-directed through Merrill Edge or if they are interested in enhanced professional portfolio management, they will be able to use Merrill Edge guided investing, or they can chose fully advised working one-on-one with the financial advisor via brokerage or fee based advisory platforms.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">We also announced at the beginning in April 2017 for clients that chose to have a financial advisor provide advice with respect to their IRA accounts, we will provide this service through our fee based advisory platform Merrill Lynch One, as we believe this is the best way for us to deliver for IRA clients who chose to have this level of service and advice. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Clients will also have the option to invest their retirement through Merrill Edge either completely self-directive or through Merrill Edge guided investing. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Turning to slide 17, global banking earned 1.6 billion which is up 22% year-over-year. Q3 reflects good revenue growth, solid cost control and solid client activity. The efficiency ratio improved to 45% in Q3. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Compared to previous third quarters, the investment banking fees this quarter were the highest since the merger with Merrill in 2009. Return on allocated capital was 17%, a 300 basis points improvement from Q3 \u201915, despite adding a couple of billion dollars of allocated capital this year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Global banking continues to drive loan growth within its risk and client frameworks producing solid year-over-year improvement at NII. Revenue growth also benefited from roughly a 175 million from gains on [NPL] this quarter versus loses in Q3 \u201915. Higher treasury fees also added to revenue growth. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">A decrease in non-interest expense compared to Q3 \u201915, reflects good expense control that offset modestly higher revenue related compensation and higher FDIC costs. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Looking at the trends on slide 18 and comparing to Q3 last year, average loans on a year-over-year basis grew 26 billion or 8%. Growth was broad based across large corporates as well as middle market borrowers and diversified across most products. Having said that, as we noted last quarter the pace of commercial loan growth has slowed over the past couple of quarters, demand across the industry appears have slowed as well. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">We remain diligent in certain sectors such as commercial real estate and energy, and we are also closely monitoring certain international regions. Average deposits increased from Q3 \u201915, up 10 billion or 3% from both new and existing clients. As we grow treasury services, we remain focused on quality deposits with respect to LCR.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Switching to global markets on slide 19, let me start by reviewing what I said last quarter, regarding this segment. The past few quarters are examples of the importance of this segment to not only its clients around the world, but also to the customers and clients of all our business segments. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Again this quarter, global markets delivered for clients by helping them raise capital, buying self-securities, as well as manage risk. We continue to invest in and enjoy leadership positions across a broad range of products. We believe this improves the sustainability of our revenue and makes us more relevant to clients across the globe. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">We\u2019ve been there for clients when they needed us across all these products. Our results this quarter reflect the strategy and continue commitment to clients. Global markets spent 1.1 billion and returned 12% on allocated capital. Revenue was up appreciably year-over-year and even outpaced typical seasonality by posting modest improvement over Q2 \u201916. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Total revenue excluding DVA was up 20% year-over-year on solid sales and trading results, which rose 18%. It\u2019s worth noting we achieved these result with slightly less balance sheet, lower VAR and 7% fewer people. Continued expense discipline drove cost 1% lower year-over-year as increases in revenue related incentives were more than offset by reductions in operating and support costs. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Moving to trends on slide 20 and focusing on the components of our sales and trading performance; sales and trading revenue of 3.7 billion excluding DVA was up 18% from Q3 \u201915, driven by FICC. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">In terms of revenue, this was the best third quarter in five years. Excluding DVA and versus Q3 \u201915, FICC sales and trading of 2.8 billion increased 39% as we built momentum as the quarter progressed across a host of credit products and continued gains in rates products. Mortgages showed particular strength among credit products, as investors sought yield.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Equity sales and trading were solid at $1 billion in revenue, but declined 17% versus Q3 \u201915, which benefitted from higher levels of market volatility and client activity. On slide 21 we present all other, which recorded a net loss of 180 million. This loss includes a previously disclosed tax charge of 350 million due to the third quarter UK enactment of tax rate reduction, which reduced the value of our UK DTI. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">A loss in the current period compares to earnings of a 152 million in Q3 \u201915 as lower security gains and higher expense litigation offset higher mortgage banking revenue. MBI revenue this quarter includes 280 million benefits from higher valuations on our MSR driven by slower expected prepaid speeds based upon recent observed trends and customer behavior. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Let me offer a few takeaways as I finish. We reported solid results this quarter that were consistent with our strategy responsible growth. We remain focused on delivering responsible growth as well as strengthening and simplifying Bank of America. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Capital and liquidity strengthened, asset quality remained strong. We grew revenue, we grew deposits, we grew loans, we delivered for clients in capital markets, we lowered costs. We invested in our future by adding sales professionals and deploying technology that helps the customers better live their financial lives and improves satisfaction. And importantly, we returned more capital to our shareholders. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">With that lets open up to questions. </p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p9\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">[Operator Instructions] we\u2019ll take our first question from John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Your line is open. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Just wanted to ask about expenses, could you talk about what kind of timing expectations you have under various projects helping to drive down your expenses further in 2017 and \u201918, maybe just remind us what are some of the big items that you\u2019re working on and should we still think about 53 billion in 2018 as kind of your hard target that you\u2019re shooting for. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Well let me start with the last part first, nothing has changed at all for our thoughts regarding the 2018 target that we discussed in the second quarter call. Again, I would note that, year-over-year we\u2019ve reduced expenses by $0.5 billion. And I would also just point out to remind everybody that if you look at expenses over a longer term, we reduced quarterly expenses ex litigation by 4.8 billion from Q3 \u201911, that\u2019s a 19 billion run rate. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So if you think about what we have to do between and 2018, I think we talked about this before, roughly a third of that is going to come from continued progress on delinquent loan servicing. The other two-thirds is going to come from a lot of different initiatives across the company. We\u2019ve talked about same or simplify an improved initiative. We\u2019re going to be utilizing technology to digitize processes, eliminating handling cost. We\u2019re going to get technology efficiencies from our datacenters consolidation and from more efficient servers. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">As I said, we\u2019re going to continue to make progress on delinquent loan servicing cost, hopefully see some modest improvement on litigation. A very important part of this is the shift to self-served digital channels, mobile, online, ATM. So that\u2019s what the list sounds like and it goes on and on. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I would emphasizes this shift to self-serve. We\u2019re seeing good momentum with more than 21 million mobile banking active users and that\u2019s growing every week, every month. 18% of our deposit transactions are now completed through mobile devices, that\u2019s better for customers, it\u2019s also better for our shareholders. It\u2019s one-tenth the cost of walking into a branch. So it\u2019s all these things kind of put together, it\u2019s initiatives across the whole company. It\u2019s going to come a lot from support and operations, but there\u2019s a little bit in the front office as well as we get more efficient. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">In terms of the timing Paul, is it something that we should think of as ramping throughout 2017, and is it longer tail at the end. Can you give us a sense there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I would say it\u2019s going to be fairly spread out throughout the whole process, however, as you think about one quarter over next, it\u2019s not going to be straight down every quarter. Not every quarter is the same, there is going to be some lumpiness. Let\u2019s look at the fourth quarter for example, we traditionally have some seasonality in the fourth quarter, so generally we\u2019ll make progress, but don\u2019t expect that you\u2019re going to see it in every single quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And then a second question just quickly on net interest income. Can you help us try to translate your 100 basis points rate sensitivity into something closer to what one fed hike might do for your net interest income, and what would be the trajectory of NII and NIM if we did get a fed hike this quarter? What would you expect more in the near term next quarter too on NII and NIM?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I can help you through that. So if you look about 25 basis points that would be one quarter of our 5.3 billion in sensitivity. If you want to assume that 25 basis points increases the long end by 25 basis points, you kind of know the answer. You can roughly take a quarter of it, perhaps even a little bit more because we\u2019re probably more asset sensitive on the first 25 and the last 25 of that 100. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">But if you don\u2019t want to increase on the long end, just look at the short end we\u2019ve disclosed. It\u2019s 3.3 billion, you could divide that by 4 and get a pretty good sense of what 25 basis points would do over the subsequent 12 months. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And we\u2019ll take next question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Just curious for point of clarification, Brian had mentioned global markets, feels like it\u2019s taken a little share. Alluded to global peers restructuring, completely get it, believe it\u2019s going to happen. Just curious if you can give a little color on where you might see some of that evidence taking shape product, [indiscernible] whatever?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I\u2019ll try to do that, but let me just start with a couple of thoughts. First of all, I think it\u2019s difficult to see share shifts in global markets in any given quarter. Fee pools are just not as transparent as they are, and let\u2019s say invest banking fees or other areas. What we know is client activity was up in the third quarter and that\u2019s what drives our short term results. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Over the longer term, it\u2019s easier just to assess what\u2019s going on with fee pools and share. So, I just want to point out from \u201914 to \u201915 on declining fee pools, we\u2019re pretty sure we improved our share, third parties tell us that. And I think that share has come from a number of regions and a number of firms and a number of products as competitors adjust their strategies and capabilities. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">More specifically we\u2019ve been investing in rates, but for a number of years, I think we\u2019re making some progress there. We have a very strong credit platform as you know, I think we\u2019re making progress there relative to the competitors around the world, and I think we\u2019re investing in equities, and I think your equities revenue is down, but I think you\u2019re seeing improvement relative to the fee pool and equities as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I do want to emphasize very importantly that our strategy is to have a diversified product portfolio across both FICC and equities and globally. That\u2019s what our clients need and want from us, and so you could see gains one quarter and one place and see something lower in another place, and that\u2019s okay with us. That\u2019s our strategy. It\u2019s about what the client needs in any given quarter. If we\u2019re doing a little bit worse in one place, we\u2019re probably doing better in another place. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Fair enough nature of the business, I guess. One another one, and I appreciate all the color on the different products and what you\u2019re doing on the wealth management. The curious move in the quarter was the move away from the commission based IRAs, and I\u2019m curious, is that more specifically done to avoid the best interest contract. I\u2019m just curious based on how we roll forward, if the SEC comes in, what that might mean. You talked about giving customer choice, but this sounds like less choice for the FA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Look, clients are going to have three ways to invest in their IRA, they\u2019re going to do it completely, self-direct to Merrill Edge. They are going to be able to do it online, but enhance with professional portfolio managed through Merrill Edge guide and investing. And again for those clients who want one on one advice and service from their FA, they\u2019re going to be able to do that on a fee based advisory platform. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">What we\u2019ve decided not to do is use the best interest exemption to allow IRA accounts to be added to our brokerage platform where clients pay on a transaction basis. After reviewing all our options, let\u2019s say, if a client choses one on one advice and service on her IRA, we believe the best way to provide that advice is through Merrill Lynch One on our fee based advisory platform.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">We took a lot of time to make this decision. We took months thinking about this, we did research. We believe this is in the best interest of our client and our advisors. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I don\u2019t doubt that, I worry about just the execution of it. I\u2019m assuming it means that the advisor has to talk to the client and explain this whole thing and just --.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yeah, that\u2019s right. But the advisors are going to be tough to their clients and explain the best interest exemption. That\u2019s going to be a much harder compensation than the one we\u2019re going to have.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And we\u2019ll take the next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Couple questions, just one on loan growth, could you give us a sense as to how you think you\u2019re trajecting there. We talked a little bit about market share and trading. Could we talk a little bit about how you think you\u2019re doing in the lending side of the equation and if there\u2019s any like there. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">We feel good about loan growth, the economy feels good. So we are confident that we can grow. But of course there\u2019s going to be some uncertainty, and as I said in certain sectors and certain regions around the world. I would remind you that we are focused on responsible growth. So, in some of those, we\u2019re going to look a little bit different than some of our competitors in some places, but we feel good. Year-over-year if you look at our business segments, we had 7% loan growth. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">One of the areas that I just wanted to dig in a little bit more to is on the mortgage side where you have had some loan growth, but I\u2019m just wondering if there is more opportunity there as it relates to either taking some duration exposures or on credit as you\u2019ve moved in to some wider credit boxes with my first home which is insure by Fannie and Freddie, but just want to get some color on that. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Betsy if you go to page six of the materials you can see that we\u2019re continuing in the mortgage area overall, so thinks both in home equity and first mortgage loan. You can see that we continue to run off some of that non-core portfolio and overall the balances grow in the business segment, and we expect that to continue. We\u2019re doing about 2,000 applications a day, we\u2019ve got a 1,000 each plus in each of the products that have continued to grow. And so we\u2019ll continue to drive that core capability to the customer. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">In terms of expansion of product sets, we have a limited product that we built for some of the 3% down payment for $0.5 billion a year for production just to give us a more competitive product there but limited to size, and we\u2019ll do some other things. But we\u2019re going to stick with the core credit. </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Remember who you\u2019re talking to her Betsy. In our experience the mortgage is probably deeper than most people. So we will stick with what our customers need and what we think the right but for the company is. </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay, so as you\u2019re thinking about your revenue growth from here, which are the three key legs that you expect are going to keep that revenue growth growing. </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I think if you think about the growth, you\u2019ve got the side and you\u2019ve got the fee side and if you think about the interest side it\u2019s going to be driven by balanced growth between loans and deposits, and I think we keep growing deposits every year $60 billion we\u2019re paying four basis points in consumer and think about that dynamic and putting that to work in anything we can is important, and we continue to grow loans at less rate than we grow (inaudible). If that\u2019s going to drive our NIM, it\u2019s just a bigger and bigger, lower and lower cost deposit base. </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And on the loan side, I think consumers growing better now than commercial in linked quarter, but overall we expect commercial will get back in a little bit as the economy continues and some of the uncertainty listed in the political season here. </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So on loans and deposits, it will just be growing out. As you\u2019ve seen year-over-year, our core growth is 7% on loans and growth on deposits. On the fee side, what you\u2019re seeing is the dynamic and its specially fee areas finally turn a little bit stable and then turning for us in the card revenue and things like that, which would hit sort of the inflexion point where the run down and relative interchange due to selling some portfolios and getting out of non-core portfolios and putting on the core portfolios with rewards attached to which helps us generate deposit and things like that is stabilizing and starting to see in the last few quarters, card income starting to move up a bit. And on services charges it\u2019s been relatively stable.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So the fee side will be driven more by wealth management and markets and things like that and consumers\u2019 stable which is good because it had been a drag for a long time. </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And then on the expense side, you indicate all of the various technology efforts that you\u2019ve got underway, but is there more that you can do on the comp side as well?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">When we have less people going through our bonus pools and stuff, so you can see the comp continue to drift down. A large part of the comp obviously is the wealth management business which there\u2019s no meaningful changes there, but in the other businesses we continue as we have less people, we continue to reduce that as a percentage of revenue.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">We\u2019ll take our next question from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Maybe you could talk a little bit about the credit cycle, I think one of the major pushback from investors is that we\u2019re going to start to see credit at worse. But I think you guys are pretty clear that you are not lowering standards to drive growth. So how do you think about the cycle from here, like I said at the start?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I think I said it earlier, if you think about the last several quarters of earnings call, it\u2019s not going to get any better than this and every quarter it gets slightly better and that in part is because we\u2019re still getting the benefits of the changes made six, seven, eight years ago coming through the consumer business i.e. that what we call back book portfolios or legacy portfolios or whatever word you want to use continue to run-off with higher credit risk and we keep putting and have put on and continue to put on higher credit quality. </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So if you think about overall charge-offs of 880 this quarter, that\u2019s driven by the consumer business and that\u2019s driven by the card and some in legacy home equities. And so keeping the card business where we wanted is critical and you\u2019re seeing us continue, even as we start to see that portfolio both nominally and rate the charge-off picture strong. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So when you go back and look at what happened during the crisis the charge-offs came abnormally from the edges of credit and we\u2019ve kept ourselves out of that. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So you feel like you can keep at least ratios as you grow pretty stable?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">We have done that. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And just maybe follow-up on the capital ratios, while also that the [RTB] ways drops while the balance sheet grew a little bit. So it seems like you reduced risk. Where was that and can that continue?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yeah, now you\u2019re speaking about the advanced approaches we had dropped. We have it under standardized as well just late last. And that drop came again from legacy portfolios running off, and from a continued work by our goal markets team to better manage their balance sheet relevant to those ratios. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Is there any more detail or can you get a little more from here? </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yeah, there\u2019s always more to do, and we are focused on a lot of different regulatory metrics, and we\u2019re looking at all of them where there are some maybe a little bit more important than others right now and we are focused on all of them. And I think there\u2019s more to come there. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Obviously as we grow balance sheet, as we grow loans and deposits, we are going to continue to see some increase particularly on the standardize side. But relative to that growth we can continue to make a little bit of progress incrementally. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And our next question comes from Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O\u2019Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Can you talk about the strategy within the securities book? You did mention that you added some later in the quarter, and obviously deposit growth has been exceeding loan growth to justify that. But give some color in terms of what you are buying, the duration, and how to make sure it doesn't get too big relative to the size of the balance sheet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yeah Matt you pick up on the (inaudible) and the drives. We have a securities portfolio because we have more deposits coming in that we have loans. So our view of that portfolio is, we don\u2019t take credit risk there and so we have two alternatives treasuries and mortgage backed securities or cash I guess is the third. And so that\u2019s how we invested and Paul can take you through his earlier comments a little bit and give you some color on that. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">But I think people always have to remember, the reason why we have more is because our deposits grew at $60 billion year-over-year and that\u2019s more than our loans grew by quite a bit. So Paul you want to answer or give some color on that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Sure. Just one step back, obviously what we\u2019re doing every day is managing earnings, capital, liquidity and interest rate risk. We think that portfolio and where we want to invest things. This quarter as you noted, our deposit growth exceeded our loan growth, and so we did add significantly to the investment portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Most of that incremental amount we devoted to treasuries, just as we think about the balance in that portfolio, we wanted just to add a little bit more treasuries. That\u2019s really kind of it. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O\u2019Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And then a little bit related, but on the deposit side, obviously a very strong growth year-over-year, you mentioned $60 billion and really little to no repricing despite the one bump in fed rates that should impact the year-over-year comp. So, I guess the question is, if we do get a rate increase, do you think you\u2019ve got more flexibility to limit the possible pricing given its basically worked so far and loan growth has obviously not enough to absorb the deposit growth you have. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Remember that the reason why you don\u2019t see much repricing is really two or three dynamics. One is, a 450 billion of our deposits are non-interest bearing. So they aren\u2019t going to reprice. The great debate is about how sticky are those. And if you think about that, and there\u2019s a dominate by our consumer business and our non-interest bearing accounts and consumer have doubled in size over the last five or six years due to focusing on primary accounts in the house or where they run their household finances through our account and therefore the correct deposit are check and things like that. </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So, the first thing the number are [1 trillion] to 450 non-interest bearing and a dominant part of that consumer and also in the wealth management, (inaudible) transactional count of both consumers and then on the business side similarly we have driven our deposits to be really LCR friendly and core operating accounts. And so those aren\u2019t going to move, the non-interest bearing aren\u2019t going to move much and the big debate is how much balance will be there and we feel confident that the balances will stay just because of the nature of the accounts. </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And then when you go to the second dynamic, remember with all those deposit growth, one of the things we continue to do and the impact less and less is we are expecting consumer business running off CD still at a fairly decent cliff that were historically used to fund prior companies, balance sheets that we don\u2019t need the funding that caused. </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So we have some roll over, but that continues to decline, that weighted average cost drops off and that cost drops off and it drives down or holds steady the weighted average cost. And then if you look at money and other interest bearing they really haven\u2019t moved much. So we feel good about the consumer, we forget base overall. We feel very good about the consumer deposit base just cross 600 billion for the first time in the company\u2019s history and consumers generally, and with that I think if rates rise, we think that it is substantial value for the company and Paul gave you what you think about that earlier with a quarter of 3.3 billion, 25% of 3.3 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">We\u2019ll take our next question from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ken Usdin</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Wanted to ask about the card business a little bit, I saw in the deck that you grew card issuance at the fastest level since 2008. And there is a burden on the fee side with reward stuff and balances are still flat. I was wondering if you could walk us forward and help us understand a little bit better just the ROA and income direction of the card business? When do we start to see that show up in both balances, and when do expect to see that fee growth come along for the ride, given the good underlying growth that we haven't quite seen yet in the financials?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I think you\u2019re noticing some modest card balance growth in the quarter, which we think will continue as we add new accounts and again we\u2019re very focused on adding high quality accounts there. I think you probably also noticed that while combined debit and credit card spend was good in the quarter at 5%, 6% of it could fuel, I\u2019m adjusting for our divestitures last year that the growth in the card camp was impacted by customer reward programs. </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">However just focusing on the fee income, this is some really key benefits of our strategy which is a track relatively higher quality card customers reward them for deepening their overall relationship with us. This strategy really drives deposit growth and makes deposits stickier, plus we believe these customers have little loss rates, they used to (inaudible) which helps us lower cost. </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I think when you want to see the effect of this, you have to look at the overall consumer segment and what\u2019s going on there in terms of growth of profits and improvement in expenses. And lastly I just point out, our risk adjusted margins on card are stronger and over 9%. This is in no way a signal that we are not going to be able to grow the card income line. I just want to get a better sense of how we think about it. </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I think if you think about that more broadly, we had the last divestitures of size we made in this card business were the fourth quarter of last year, and now through the P&amp;L. So you were through the balances and through the things. And what you\u2019re starting to see if you look at the trends this year, you\u2019re starting to see positive movement both in card income and in balances as we move across the year and we expect that to continue.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">It will be strong responsible growth and one of the great debates we have in the company as people say why can\u2019t you grow this faster or we\u2019re giving up too much in the interchange for the preferred balance the preferred rewards. The interesting question is, are you giving up something you\u2019d never have in the preferred rewards i.e. we\u2019re bringing more customer relationship in debt and that gets us something. </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So incrementally the net interchange is actually there as oppose to what theoretically get gross interchange with a non-customer in the (inaudible) program. So, we focus on entire customer relationship. It is very valuable, it is very powerful. And believe me if we could grow faster responsibly we would. But the idea is just to grind up a slow and steady growth and we\u2019re starting to see that come through and largely it was massed in \u201914-\u201915 and behind that those areas, because we are divesting a lot non-core relationships and now we have synergy one and we have the core card business we wanted. </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And again you can see it if you look at the whole segment. I\u2019m also comparing us to peers, but just take a look at our PP&amp;R year-over-year it fell 10%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ken Usdin</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Understood. Second quick question is you mentioned that you are now achieving the cost of capital in an ROE above 10% and capital is just still building. Do you think you can continue to hold does not improve the ROE as capital will likely continue to grow, presuming that you still will get those benefits going forward, and you are not at the point of returning more than 100% of your earnings yet?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Well I think embedded in that the future return of capital and we now have a significant buffer above the requirements. And as Paul said, we continue to optimize our requirement. So I think you\u2019re little bit of a horse race between increasing earnings and increasing capital and as we return more you expect that the horse race increasing earnings would stay ahead of it. But we\u2019ve got room to go and we\u2019re driving at it. But if we don\u2019t hit - the issue is that our capital continues to grow that capital is also used as investor and continues to go under our book value and so it\u2019s not going anywhere. It\u2019s there to be returned when we can get through the process of getting from where we are to higher percentages of capital return and ultimately returning excess capital.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And we have a goal to return more. </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And we\u2019ll take our next question from Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead. </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">You've reduced your branch count from 6,000 to 4,600, where do you think that count can go? And on the one hand, we heard you say almost 1 million customers walk into branches each day, but on the other hand you have grown deposits 1.2 trillion. You did mention more self-service digital channels. You did mention mobile banking is 18% of the deposit transactions, and less reliance on the branches might ease any extra pressure to sell more products in this low rate environment. So where do you think you might take the branch count to, and I don't think you mentioned the impact of the cross-selling issues on Bank of America or if we wake up one day and find out that Bank of America did something inappropriate? </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Well lets go to how we run our consumer business. We run our consumer business consistent with responsible growth for the company, and what that means is that you focus on deepening relationships what we call [stair stapler]. It\u2019s the core deposit account, the core credit card and getting it used in the core mortgage and the core home equity and the core auto loans that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been driving at and we continue to drive that and that\u2019s the backbone of what we did and how we reposition this company over many years. </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">In terms of the branches, Mike, yeah you rounded off our statistics which Paul talked about earlier, but it is a complex optimization in it but it all starts with the consumer. What is the consumer going to do? And so while 18% of deposits were made by mobile, the deposits 82% by the very nature aren\u2019t. And where do they go? About 50 percentage points of that go through the ATM and about another 30% odd go through the teller line still today. And so you have to be ready and able to serve in all dynamics. </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So what we continue to do is optimize the branch structure, the call structure, the ATM structure, the mobile structure and the online structure altogether. And the way to think about that optimization and why it is extremely important business to the company is that we\u2019ve gone from 300 basis points the cost of all that to deposits to about 150 over the last 6-7 years and that\u2019s by continuing to optimize the physical plan as well as all these other means. So if you ask me, your question is, how far you can you? You have to also then think about what we want to do monitor branch. </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So if you look back at some of the statistics that Paul had in the deck for consumer, when you see things like appointment set up or 340,000 in the third quarter. So just think about, 340,000 times the customer went on a mobile phone and asked to come to a branch. So we need those branches to receive those mobile phone customers and why are they coming usually for much more important financial transaction to them then handing us a check for deposit.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So it\u2019s a quality versus quantity and making sure we understand. So we are optimizing all those and you can see them on page 14 on the lower right, you can see different clues. I\u2019d say we went from 7 million visits probably 4-5 years ago to 6 to 5. But those 5 are of a higher quality, and we think that\u2019s important. And there are certain transactions and certain capabilities that you just have to have at your branch, and you just have to do it face to face, Very difficult things like, how to get a power of attorney for a parent that\u2019s sick or I want to do a mortgage, still difficult to do through the phone and things like that. </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So we\u2019ll have all aspects, we drive it down and then you can see that we continue to make that progress..</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I mean just as a follow-up and slide 14 is kind of saying Bank of America we're a [Thinktech] company and look how well we are doing, and you are showing some good growth rates. That chart on the upper right, so at what point does that lead to a greater number of branch reductions? Do you have the answer and you don't want to say for competitive or you don\u2019t know yet, it\u2019s kind of a give and take based on the customer experience. Some of your competitors talk about closing 100-200 branches per year, you reduced 112 over the last year, but it seems to be slowing. So I\u2019m trying to get a sense of that. </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I\u2019d say that the point is that, we\u2019ve run this business and we start with the consumer and their activities and their behaviors. So what they want to do and the key is not to get ahead of them, because that can cause you problems and not to be behind them because that can be cost issues and empty branches. So even in the 112 we\u2019re down we\u2019ve added branches in places like Denver. The Denver branch that we\u2019re adding are top 10% of performing branches today on relationship building. We\u2019ve added branches in Manhattan, we\u2019ve added branches in Minneapolis. And so we\u2019re in a sea change in terms of what the branches look like individually. The new branches are different. </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">We\u2019re adding branches we didn\u2019t have, we\u2019re closing branches where the utilization isn\u2019t there. The nature of how far a customer will travel is also different now than it was 10-15 years ago. I think you said what are all the different reasons? The answer is, I think you said we\u2019ll follow the customers and I don\u2019t know the exact number because I can tell you, eight years ago when we had 6100, there were people who said there was never going to be less branches in our system and maybe we should add more and guess what we\u2019re 4500. </p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">We\u2019ll take our next question from Paul Miller with FBR &amp; Company. </p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Paul Miller</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">You guys took an MSR write-up or a hedging benefit; I can't really which one it is, about $360 million. But you did write up the MSR from 51 basis points to 60 basis points. Was that all rate driven, the 10 year did go up a little bit or was that also some better credit metrics out of the servicing portfolio?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">We had a $280 million benefit this quarter and that was from a higher valuation of the MSR, which was due to slower observe pre-payment speeds. So we\u2019re just updating the way we value that. We have to monitor our - it\u2019s a level three asset, so there\u2019s a lot of things that go in to that. It\u2019s hard to value and you\u2019ve got to be continually looking at that valuation and we thought it was time based upon observation of pre-payment speeds to make a change in some key assumptions. </p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">We\u2019ll take our next question from Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. </p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I just wanted to follow up on a couple of questions related to the various consumer lending businesses. First, Paul just from your response to Ken's question a moment ago on card. I heard everything you said about the risk-adjusted margin and the credit quality of the portfolio, etcetera. But just to be clear, are you expecting improving, stable or deteriorating ROA based on the current competitive environment, because it seems like many peers are underscoring the near-term risks to profitability from awards and customer acquisition costs?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Look based upon how we\u2019re growing the business, how we\u2019re running the business we expect stability. </p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And with respect to mortgage, I saw there was about $100 million benefit from rep and warrant release. How much of that reserve still exists and what would be your expectations about potentially realizing it at this stage given where we are with respect to that issue?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">The rep and warranty is counter revenue. So was that you were referring to?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yes, correct. It's the provision line item. You had a negative provision.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">So if that\u2019s going to bump around, that bumps around because --.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lee McEntire</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Eric, it\u2019s Lee. I think what you\u2019re looking at what Paul is referring to is a contra revenue item, so it\u2019s a negative revenue item when its provision expense on the provision. </p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Maybe I will come back to you in a bit. Just finally on auto it seemed that some peers were signaling that competitive conditions in auto underwriting were easing a bit after intensifying over the past several quarters. Are you seeing anything like that across any particular segment of the FICO strata? </p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">We\u2019re continuing to see good growth in consumer vehicle lending the way that we run the business. We\u2019re up roughly 7% or $7 billion or 17% year-over-year. Again we\u2019re focused on prime and super prime, so originations were down modestly Q3 versus the prior quarter as we accepted a little bit less dealer flow, but we still feel good about that product offering. </p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">The third quarter average book FICO scores remained at approximately 770, debt-to-income was at all-time lows. We\u2019re not following the market expansion to 84 months in terms of tenure. We\u2019ve got a maximum tenure of 75 and I think in the third quarter we were averaging around 67. So we\u2019re getting the growth within our responsible growth framework and we feel good about it. </p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">We\u2019ll take our next question from Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead. </p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Want to kick things off with a follow-up to an earlier question on the DOL. Paul you had noted that Merrill FAs will no longer be permitted to engage in brokerage activities in retirement accounts. I was hoping you can give us an update as to what portion of Merrill client assets are currently in brokerage IRA, and maybe more specifically, how should we think about the net economic impact from transitioning some of those retirement assets into some of the other offerings that you highlighted, whether it be fee-based which should generate higher fees versus robo or self-directed Merrill Edge?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Sure. So the primary affected portion of our business is in the transaction brokerage retirement accounts. And if you look at our roughly 2 trillion of due inclined assets outside of loans and deposits, we would see the DOL rule having an impact on significantly less 10% of those balances. And again that\u2019s as the industry works towards the full implementation of the rule in January 18. </p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">So as you noted, we\u2019re going to see some geography movement on the P&amp;L. There\u2019s going to be some shifts, and if I had a guess today, we might see some modest revenue impact in 2017, but it\u2019s really kind of way too early to know how it\u2019s all going to shake out. But we would expect to mitigate that in subsequent years. </p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I think people, just Steven you talk about backing up for the fuller trends on wealth manager. There\u2019s been a constant decline in brokerage revenue over the years largely because it\u2019s really been in the industry and we have been moving more to a financial device to manage those account executions. And so in that broker - obviously a limited portion of that\u2019s IRA related in both counts, but the reality is this is against the backdrop that you\u2019ll see that brokerage number has been tough to chase for five years now. </p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Got it, okay. And just one other quick follow-up on the same topic, the press article highlighted some of the changes that you've made indicated that some clients that would transition to the, \u201chigher touch advisory offerings\u201d will be rebated some incremental fees. I was wondering how are you planning to apply changes to the fee structure for those brokerage assets that do, in fact, transition. I'm just struggling to see how a two-tiered structure might work in practice across the hundreds of billions of assets that would be affected here?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I think the implementation has to be carefully handled. In the team Andy and John have been leaders in trying to figure this out the right way for the client and we start with what\u2019s best for the client. So what you\u2019re reading about is, there\u2019ll be adjustments made clients-by-clients basis in that circumstances and what they want from us, and FA\u2019s will engage in a lot of conversations about that as we go through the next several months. </p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay, thanks Brian. Just one more on the topic of capital, just switching gears for a moment. Following (inaudible) recent remarks, there's one area of debate has been whether the Collins Floor would in fact apply to this new capital framework, i.e. whether you will be forced to manage to capital minimums under both the standardized and advanced approaches. Now that you've had some time to digest the initial release or guidance, I was wondering if you can give us any insights into how you are thinking about that potential change?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay well that looked like obviously a technical question and it\u2019s not that we haven\u2019t thought about it, but to be frank, its\u2019 just a speech at this point and he didn\u2019t really address that in his speech. So we don\u2019t really know the answer. That\u2019s one of the questions we have. I think once we get the best proposal we\u2019ll have a better idea, but all I can tell you is based upon our current reading of the speech, and particularly some of the changes you mentioned in CCAR around asset growth, we think that the substitution of the capital conservation buffer would be with the stress capital buffer would not be a material change for Bank of America given our risk profile and given how we run the company.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">We\u2019ll take our next question from Brian Foran with Autonomous Research. </p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Foran</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I guess we've had a couple of good quarters in FICC both for you and the industry, and I know volatile business not really looking for quarterly expectations. But just more broadly there is an investor debate, is it just a couple of good quarters or has the business absorbed all the changes in regulation, absorbed low rates, absorbed all the restructuring required and the cycles inflecting FICCs at the bottom and has upward pressure from here? So where do you come in on the debate, is it a couple of good quarters at this point or has FICC bottomed?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Well I think the way I come out of that debate is to go back many years ago and sort of think through the repositioning was done in our company and so the key was to make fixed work. You\u2019re talking about revenue, but we look at profit and so to get the profit we needed to have a fixed income and equities business. We had to take the cost structure down which we did in \u201910 or \u201911. Tom Montage and the team worked very hard at that and got the breakeven down over a $1 billion a quarter. And then we range along those a number of years and they\u2019ve actually taken out year-over-year. You can see the cost continue to be managed well despite higher revenue. </p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">So I would say taking discussion I would say that the way our fixed income business generates revenue, a lot of it is around our capabilities and underwriting, our competitive capabilities and all the different from high grade leverage to everything that goes on and that\u2019s a relatively stable pool of revenue that you see repeated. And what goes up or down is really the activity around that based on the market ceasing in certain quarters in terms of the issuance and things like that. </p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">When you think about the other thing that Tom and the team had to really go after which is to broaden our capabilities in the macro segment a little because that was something that traditionally the Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch came together and so that\u2019s added some more volume to it. So we think we\u2019ve been gaining share as Paul said earlier. </p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">When you look at revenue comparison with one of the top 10 without all the [lead] charge or just revenue, but we think its driven by our fixed income capability and its driven by our connectivity from the issuer of the bonds and debt to the investor, and we\u2019ll continue to drive that. So the teams\u2019 done a good job and I\u2019d say we\u2019re at a fundamental level. </p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Well this quarter feels better than last year\u2019s quarter. It\u2019s not a quarter that when you look across four or five years that we haven\u2019t come close to on many cases and have done better than a few times. </p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Foran</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">I guess a similar question on commercial lending. You referenced some of the strategies you have in place driving responsible growth, and how you felt good about the business going forward. But we saw this pause across the industry in the third quarter in commercial growth, the Fed numbers, your numbers, other banks reporting so far. </p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Have you seen signs of customer demands coming back late in 3Q and early in 4Q, do you have visibility and confidence that the commercial loan growth cycle more broadly is still in gear? </p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">What we noticed in commercial in the quarter was lower industry growth this quarter, and I think that really reflected a slow-down in closed, actually books closed acquisition financing for us which probably may be different for peers depending on the timing of transactions. And then uncertainty around the election and then I think some lingering concerns around certain countries or regions. That\u2019s what I think impacted the third quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">When you look at the US, when you look around the globe, when you look at GDP growth, we\u2019re optimistic. We think the economy feels good, so in a good economy, we should be able to grow commercial loans. We\u2019ll have to stay focused on some sectors and some regions, but we think we can grow commercial loans. </p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">There\u2019s enough utilization rates and revolvers, they came off their highs, but they\u2019re at the higher end of the range which also suggest or reflects good commercial activity. We\u2019re adding bankers in the US and commercial banking in small business. We\u2019re adding them to regions where we know we have some synergies or some capabilities and big MSAs. So there\u2019s no reason why we can\u2019t grow within our responsible growth framework, assuming the economy continues to trough along here. </p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Also if you think about by sub-asset class in real estate we modulate our growth based on our view of wanting a diverse portfolio and then how we lend in the business. And if you see that number it was growing on and it flattened out a little bit, and that relative to others that was a difference. </p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">But Paul\u2019s last point is a key point. They are a credit worthy customers that we can do more with and the only way to do that is because we have a talented world class commercial banking team, is to add more capacity. And that capacity is starting to build and it takes a while, because we hire commercial banker and we sometimes give them some of the under-covered in our portfolio and then they go after the prospects that we have and it takes a while to build those up. </p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">People don\u2019t change commercial banking relationships in an afternoon. So in our business banking and our middle market especially across America, we have been adding commercial bankers and we expect that to be down to our benefit. Given an environment which maybe solid but okay, we\u2019d expect to gain in those markets as those bankers come on stream and become more productive and Alistair Borthwick and Katy Gnapp and their team is driving that. </p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">It has proven that those bankers do get share and you\u2019ll see that come through. </p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">We\u2019ll take our next question from Nancy Bush with NAB Research. Please go ahead. </p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Nancy Bush</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">We are all of course very attuned to the issue of fraud after the recent news at Wells Fargo, both on the customer side and on the employee side. I guess my question to you would be, as you move more to digital methods of attracting customers and keeping customers, etcetera. Is fraud on either side becoming a bigger issue, or if you could just speak to the whole issue of how you prevent fraud as you become a more electronic bank. </p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">I think when you think about fraud most people think about in terms of the electronic side, most people think about credit card, (inaudible) fraud been tried as a broad word. Arguments about whether the charge was valid, whether a [merchant] and things like that. And so there\u2019s long history of adjudicating that. </p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">So as more and more sales online by the consumer, the techniques for online continue to develop. At phase to phase or point-of-sale the chip card win were largely through all our customer having chip cards, merchant what we call chip-on-chip i.e. used with a merchant chip machine is rising sort of 1% or so a quarter and is now as best we judge it in the high 20s or something like that Nancy. So all that being said, we expect to get leverage in our fraud losses in the consumer business, year-over-year we expect that to continue to come down, and so yes, that is a major initiative for us to continue to drive that down, part of its education to consumers, part of it getting the chip cards in the hand getting machine merchant using the chip machines. Part of it is the tokenization and wallets and things that go on in Visa check out and all the variations in Master Card and getting, because that\u2019s tokenized better execution and is more secure. </p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">And so our view as a provider has been to adapt all these wallets and technologies that have this tokenization capabilities and that then drives down the cost of losses due to merchant complains and other types of things. So you\u2019re absolutely right, cyber security, theft of cards from other people and sold on the internet, all of that stuff is important for us and so we spend as we said $0.5 billion a year protecting ourselves, but also part of it is making sure we understand where our consumers are in terms of lost cards and things like that. </p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Nancy Bush</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Well how about on the other side there, the employee side, opening false accounts. If you could just speak to how you think your methodology is different from what produced the problems at Wells Fargo.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">May be I\u2019ll take that one. Look I want to take just one step back, because to really answer that question you just have to have a better appreciation for how we run Bank of America, and it truly really does start with our purpose which is to help customers better live their financial lives and from there you have to understand what we mean responsible growth. </p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">If you ask anyone in the company, responsible growth, it\u2019s about developing relationships so that we can grow with our customer\u2019s overtime, based upon their needs and goals. It\u2019s not about the number of products that would be open, its whether customers want to meet the products and services we\u2019re offering them and use them. That\u2019s how we measure ourselves. </p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">We spent years building controls and governance and escalation around us. We\u2019re always monitoring them. It\u2019s just how we run the company. So that\u2019s probably the best answer in can give you in terms of how we think about this issue. </p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Nancy Bush</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">And Brian, I have what is going to be a difficult question for you. But in response to the problems at Wells Fargo, we have seen them separate the Chairman and the CEO roles. And while that may have been due to exigent circumstances, do you foresee another push now either by regulators or by shareholders to separate those roles? </p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Nancy, I\u2019d say this, if we have dialog with all our shareholders off and Jack Bovender, Lead Independent Director, obviously we went through his, your so-goal, and we (inaudible) they voted on it, but the key is how we run the company, how we govern ourselves. So again Paul\u2019s view of what we talked about responsible growth, one of the tents is to be sustainable and sustainable and although it has to be sustainable and it involves things like you got to invest in the future, but also involves how we govern company and our Board, independence of our Board, the experience on our Board, how they approach their responsibilities I think is very strong and our shareholders have understood that agree with that. </p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">So I think we govern ourselves in a very touch fashion i.e. the Board demanding on us and understand the strategy and has helped support through some times when people would challenge it. And I think it\u2019s proven to be the right strategy at this point. And so if we to technicalities, our leader and director duty are strong as anybody in the industry. If you look at all the new government surveys have come out all the words about proper governance and all the difference things you\u2019ve been seeing recently, we made or exceed everything. Anybody says to go to (inaudible) comfortable there. </p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">We\u2019ll take our next question from Brenna Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. </p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Just wanted to follow-up on the fiduciary rule questions before. So I appreciate retirement assets are less than 10% of your balances as you've highlighted before. But I think what a lot of folks are thinking about here is that SEC has been pretty clear that they are working on their own version of this applying to taxable. And so when people watch what you are doing here on the fiduciary rule for retirement people, it's sort logic to assume you would apply the same policy in the event we see a similar rule come out more broadly. So isn't that the message that you are basically sending to Fas, and aren't you concerned that FAs might look at your platform versus some of your competitors that will offer the (inaudible) and think that they might have greater amount of flexibility as some of those other platforms?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">When you look at the advisor attrition today, its\u2019 at an all-time and we don\u2019t expect significant attrition for the same reason that attrition is low today. Merrill Lynch is a great place to work and serve your clients. So if you are FA, you\u2019re looking at a platform. We have market leading capabilities, we have breadth of products across banking and wealth management. </p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">We have lots of options in terms of servicing clients. We got great technology that we are investing in, tremendous transparency that provider tool, Merrill Lynch One, award winning research and an incredible global execution to global markets. So there\u2019s a lot of reasons to be here. This is a great place to serve your clients. We are implementing a strategy that creates significant flexibility for our advisors and we\u2019re delivering fiduciary, best interest advice to the clients. </p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">I said before we\u2019ll be king to this decision not to use the best interest exemption after a lot of months of thinking and research and this is better for our advisors and its better for our clients. The best interest exemption is going to create confusion, it\u2019s got operational pay-in for clients, it\u2019s going to be inefficient and cumbersome for advisors. This is the best solution we believe for our clients and advisors. </p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">And if you look at the BRASS tax financials in to the third quarter of \u201916 we had $4.4 billion of revenue in our wealth management business. Of the 4.4 billion, 500 in total was brokerage and so this part of the business has been declining in favor of financial advice to the clients and to manage portfolios that meet the needs of the clients and have investment framers and decisions based on the client\u2019s goals. So the goals based method is the dominant method in our business and so you\u2019ve seen a constant growth in asset management fees, net interest income and other sources of revenue and frankly a cost decline in the brokerage business across many years. So the SEC has an obligation to rule on this at some point and they will and we\u2019ll adjust to that there, but its consistent, we have been taking the business five or seven years. </p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Sure, I get it and there's no question that commissions have been declining. It\u2019s just that when you look at some of the asset classes like alternatives and such it's hard to get everything to fit into a fee-based approach. So that was the gist of my question. But maybe going a different direction --</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Careful not to speak, just be clear we\u2019re not doing away with brokerage. Unless something changes in the industry and that\u2019s going to affect everybody, we\u2019re not doing away with brokerage. Brokerage is a very important part of our advisory relationship, and FA\u2019s will work that out with their clients what\u2019s best for them. </p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Right. But if we take the logical conclusion that your approach here with retirement would be similar to taxable under the assumption and, I am making assumptions with all of this, but we all have to that the SEC comes out with a similar rule, then your option within to maintain brokerage is self-direct. And I could see how FAs might dislike the idea of having a component of their relationship move effectively away from them. So what has been the response from FAs of this idea that if we want to maintain brokerage it has to go the self-directed route, and has that tapped in on any of the worries that some of these brokers have seen much of their book shift over to discount brokers that would fit in that type of an approach?</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">I thinking you\u2019ve stated yourself that you\u2019re making a lot of assumption. I think let\u2019s let it play out. We have the biggest and most capable business in the world, making more money and having better margins than anybody else and I think we\u2019ll figure it out. </p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">We\u2019ll take our next question from Matthew Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. </p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Perhaps a bigger picture question, on your media call you were asked a question on Brexit, and it sounds like you do have plans in place for that which certainly makes sense. I guess given relative to your $53 billion cost target for 2018 and the fact that the negotiations seem to be starting to gear up early next year, how you\u2019re thinking about the costs in the global markets and global banking businesses from Brexit if it ends up being a harder Brexit than a softer Brexit?</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">I think it\u2019s just too early to tell at this point. We don\u2019t know how it\u2019s all going to unfold in the UK and in Europe. We don\u2019t know what the effect is going to be on our clients on the new rules. So as I said on the press call, we\u2019ve developed plans based upon various scenarios and we\u2019re just going to have to wait and see how everything unfolds to know what we\u2019re going to do. </p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">But as I emphasized on that call, today we are focused on our clients and as I alluded to, this impacts them too. So for now we\u2019re just working with them, providing them loans, helping them raise capital to remove their money, manage risk and that\u2019s what we are focused on. </p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">Just remember (inaudible) out of there, the markets business is about 20% of our expense base today. If that\u2019s the entire business, so I don\u2019t think the impact of Brexit in the overall company we would manage it without having any impact of any great magnitude. As it relates to the European business itself, we\u2019ll have an impact if it costs us more but not to the whole company.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">And then just a quick administrative question, you mentioned on slide 9 that the non-performing loans in the commercial portfolio were increased by $340 million quarter-over-quarter. It seems like it's mostly in the energy and related space. Is that a US or are those US credits and what's your outlook for those balances going forward? </p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">Yeah with two credits, one in metals and mining, one in the US and if you look at the ratio it\u2019s at a very comfortable level. So that doesn\u2019t concern us. If you note criticized assets were down in the quarter that\u2019s because these two credits that went NPL were already in reserved for criticized. </p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">We\u2019ll take our next question from Vivek Juneja with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. </p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Vivek Juneja</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">Couple of questions, Paul, your deposits at the Fed declined pretty sharply almost 20% linked quarter, even though you had deposit growth and given that long-term rates are still very low. Can you talk a little bit about what drove that thinking?</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">Yeah, we moved some cash in to securities. We\u2019re always the managing the trade-off between sort of liquidity, capital in terms of interest rate movements and returns and we just deployed some of that as I said in US treasuries because you can think about it going from one part of the government to the other. We just moved them to get a little bit more yield. We feel good about that move and we\u2019ll continue to optimize our cash on investment securities. </p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Vivek Juneja</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">Is that saying that you don't expect rates to go up that much, given that you move credit chunk at a time when long-term rates are pretty low?</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re making any - we\u2019re not projecting any view of rates when we make that move, we\u2019re just balancing liquidity, capital and earnings. It\u2019s a big portfolio, we are always looking at to make sure that we feel good about where we are at any point in time. </p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Vivek Juneja</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">One more question, earlier you mentioned in response to a question that global markets was doing a better job managing the balance sheet. Could you give us some more color about what specifically they are doing? </p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">I\u2019m not sure I really want to give much color out there. They\u2019re doing the standard things you might do to optimize RWA, trade compression, looking at returns on various assets, and just optimizing. </p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">We\u2019ll take our next question from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead. </p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">Wanted to ask you about two strategic balance sheet decisions; one is that there seems to be a lot more retention mortgages. So when we have these surges, we are not picking up as much mortgage fees but growing mortgage loans maybe a little bit faster. That is a shift, and do you think that will hold mortgage fees down and trade-off for further net interest income down the road?</p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">Yes you\u2019ve got the dynamic but the route is as Paul was just answering last question here we continue to build cash that we need to put to work. These are our core customers, very high credit quality mortgages and pipeline is grown quarter-over-quarter and continues to grow on production passing capabilities. So you\u2019ve got it right, the technical differences that are recognizing the upfront gain on sales of the mortgage and capitalizing the servicing, you see that come through NII over time. And the other dynamic remember is the MSR asset will continue to drift down because we have less and less third party servicing. </p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">And again I want to point out, we\u2019ve done a lot of thinking about that, and we think maybe there is a near term impact on earnings but long term we think that\u2019s a better strategy for our shareholders given the risk profile of the mortgages that were originating putting on the balance sheet. </p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">And kind of in connection with that you talked about the big question on asset sensitivity, which is duration, expectation on your deposits. As you've gone through this cycle, and initially we all assumed that there was going to be a lot more volume run-off than the volumes just keep going higher. Have you adjusted that duration and is that part of why you are also comfortable putting on more mortgages that have that longer duration feel to it? </p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">In terms of the technical modeling NII we still use the same assumptions we\u2019ve used. You could have great debate in our company whether we think those assumptions are conservative or not, but in terms of the NII modeling we\u2019ve been very consistent in terms of what they got Marty the deposit data and what would change and how it would work. </p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">I think the pragmatic answer is that we are - 90% of our consumer checking accounts are core transaction accounts, the primary checking account. Those balances are touching $250 billion plus. They\u2019ve been doubled over the last seven or eight years. Those balances are the data cash flow of household and I don\u2019t think they are going to change much, but until you\u2019ve got experience the model has to sort of look backwards as we say and so we\u2019ll see what happens. But so far those of us that take the side, this will be less sensitive if [won] let\u2019s just say that. </p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">And then lastly, just a strategic utilization of capital, if you look at your allocation of capital and returns by business segment, you kind of do a weighted average, you come up with close to an 18% return. As profitability is getting higher that\u2019s getting further away from the overall return which is still around 10%. How do you envision trying to clean up either the capital positions or the overhang from overhead expenses that brings those two numbers maybe a little bit closer together? </p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">Marty, moving expenses down we talked about that earlier, that helps the returns. But we always have to remember that there is basically leave aside how the allocation works for the business, it works differently. But when you think about the 10% capital requirements for us 300 basis points or 3 percentage points of that cannot be put to use, it cannot take risk. </p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">And so we\u2019re earning all our money on the 7% and so when you think about the weighted average of that, it comes out over 10 and that means that you\u2019re in a lot more on the seven even across the whole company, and so that\u2019s one of the difficulties. So how do we optimize that, we make that 10% less dollar volume if we can keep dollar volume down and keep increasing earnings you get. That\u2019s by all the discussion Paul had in response to the questions about optimizing the balance sheet. </p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">Will we get expenses down, will we grow less risky earnings that generate an income, but it\u2019s a constant optimization, but the basic principal of people that we sometimes forget is that when you think about 10% only 30% of capital can take no risk and so basically you\u2019re in to cost of debt. </p>", "<p class=\"p p25\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p25\">We\u2019ll take our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. </p>", "<p class=\"p p25\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p25\">A question on your digital sales, obviously you\u2019ve had 18% of total sales coming through digital channels and 25% through the mobile. Can you share with us what products you are having the most success with selling through these channels and which products proved to be more challenging?</p>", "<p class=\"p p25\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p25\">Well generally you should think that the products which are more straight forward like a card application, we build a nice auto loan execution that\u2019s kind of unique and because those things are fairly straight forward applications. Mortgage and things like that it really takes a lot more process around them. So, I\u2019d say cards and autos are the [downward] part. </p>", "<p class=\"p p25\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p25\">Is there any target of where you can get these sales to as a percentage of total sales? Can eventually 50% of sales come through the digital channel?</p>", "<p class=\"p p25\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p25\">I think it will continue to rise in terms of dollar amount, probably rise in terms of percentage. But remember as sales grow overall in the company, getting in to 50 means they have to win next race in the growth overall, but we are becoming more and more capable in delivering this and that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing a nice growth and so we\u2019re applying deeply where it can really be the primary method and things like cards and auto are the easier place. </p>", "<p class=\"p p25\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p25\">And then, finally, sticking with digital; is there any application in the digital channel, where you can have success like you are having in the consumer bank in the Merrill Lynch brokerage channel?</p>", "<p class=\"p p25\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p25\">Yeah, Merrill Edge is obviously across-the-board execution; their clients utilize that in Merrill and in US Trust and the broad consumer business. So, it\u2019s a broad execution and well recognized as being one of the leaders by the various authorities. </p>", "<p class=\"p p25\">We believe and one of the things Jerry [Lockwood] and Keith Banks and Andy Sieg and John and other are working on is to increase our capabilities for both the advisor and the customer and the digital more or less stated in the (inaudible) business and so we think there is upside for us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p25\">Again less customers so the leverage is not quite the same and that\u2019s why we spend a lot of our time around the consumer, and there\u2019s just less leverage and the advisor you have to think about that business because the advisors are core strength that we have to the customer that we have to have an execution which is universal between the advisors and the customers, they can all see the same thing. So we\u2019ve got some great capabilities now My Merrill things like that. But we plan to continue and enhance them and continue to integrate them. So when they get to loans and deposits and things like that they are much more integrated over time. You can still see it all, but it\u2019s not where we want to be. </p>", "<p class=\"p p25\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p25\">And we\u2019ll take our next question from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead. </p>", "<p class=\"p p25\">Q - Brian Kleinhanzl</p>", "<p class=\"p p25\">I just had one quick question, and it\u2019s on the $52 billion expense target. If we got into an environment where you saw revenues come back more robustly near-term, could you still commit to that $53 billion target, meaning you have enough levers to pull or would you see yourself switching to maybe an efficiency ratio target if all of a sudden these revenues came back stronger? Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p25\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p25\">Yeah, if you remember when we made that target it was in the context of 1.5%, 2% GDP growth economy much like we have now in the rate environment, incremental from where we have now. So I think the shareholders and this management team would be happy if we are having a discussion about revenue related incentives going up faster than that that would be good news for the company. </p>", "<p class=\"p p25\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p26\">And it appears we have no further questions at this time. I\u2019ll return the floor to our presenters for closing remarks. </p>", "<p class=\"p p26\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p26\">Thank you very much and we look forward to speaking to you next quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p26\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p26\">And this will conclude today\u2019s program.

B Time to Required Funding (TTF) is a debt coverage measure and is expressed as the number of months unsecured holding company obligations of Bank of America Corporation can be met using only the Global Liquidity Sources held at the BAC parent company and NB Holdings without the BAC parent company issuing debt or sourcing additional liquidity. We define unsecured contractual obligations for purposes of this metric as mat urities of senior or subordinated debt issued or guaranteed by Bank of America Corporation. Prior to the third quarter of 2016, the TTF metric incorporated only the GLS of the BAC parent company. Effective September 30, 2016, the TTF metric was expanded to include the GLS of NB Holdings, following changes in the Corporations liquidity management practices, initiated in connection with the Corporations resolution planning activities, that include maintainingat NB Holdings GLS previously held at the BAC parent company. For the period shown in 2015, we have included in the amount of unsecured contractual obligations the liability, inc luding estimated costs, for the previously announced BNY Mellon private -label securitization settlement. In 1Q16, settlement payment was made for$8.5B. C The numerator of the SLR is quarter-end Basel 3 Tier 1 capital calculated on a fully phased-in basis. The denominator is total leverage exposure based on the daily average of the sum of on-balance sheet exposuresless permitted Tier 1 deductions, as well as the simple average of certain off-balance sheet exposures, as of the end of each month in a quarter. Off-balance sheet exposures primarily include undrawn lending commitments, letters of credit, po tential future derivative exposures and repo-style transactions. DRevenue for all periods included net debit valuation adjustments (DVA) on derivatives, as well as amortization of own credit portion of purchase discount and realized DVA on structured liabilities.Net DVA gains (losses) were ($101MM), ($127MM) and ($198MM) for 4Q16, 3Q16 and 4Q15, respectively. Net DVA gains (losses) included in FICC revenue were ($98MM), ($121MM) and ($190MM) for 4Q16, 3Q16 and 4Q15, respectively. Net DVA gains (l osses) included in equities revenue were ($3MM), ($6MM) and ($8MM) for 4Q16, 3Q16 and 4Q15, respectively. EVaR model uses historical simulation approach based on three years of historical data and an expected shortfall methodology equivalent to a 99% confidence level. Using a 95% confidence level, average VaR was $19MM, $22MM and $22MM for 4Q16, 3Q16 and 4Q15, respectively. 24\" data-src=\"https://staticseekingalpha1.a.ssl.fastly.net/uploads/sa_presentations/377/4377/slides/24.jpg?1484314059\" title=\"Notes\"></figure><figure class=\"item\" data-index=\"25\" itemprop=\"image\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"https://schema.org/ImageObject\"><meta content=\"https://staticseekingalpha3.a.ssl.fastly.net/uploads/sa_presentations/377/4377/slides/25.jpg?1484314059\" itemprop=\"url\">\n<meta content=\"1280\" itemprop=\"width\">\n<meta content=\"960\" itemprop=\"height\">\n<img alt=\"Bank of America Corporation (the Company) and its management may make certain statements that constitute forward -looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

It speaks only as of the particular date or dates included in the accompanying slides. Bank of America does not undertake an obligation to, and disclaims any dut y to, update any of the information provided. The Company may present certain key performance indicators and ratios excluding certain items (e.g ., DVA) which result in non-GAAP financial measures. The Company believes the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides additional clarity in understanding its results of operations and trends. For more information about the non-GAAP financial measures contained herein, please see the presentation of the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and accompanying reconciliations in the earnings press release for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 and other earnings-related information available through the Bank of America Investor Relations web site at:/investor.bankofamerica.com. The Company views net interest income and related ratios and analyses on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis, which when presented on a consolidated basis, are non-GAAP financial measures. The Company believes managing the business with net interest income on an FTE basis provides invest ors with a more accurate picture of the interest margin for comparative purposes. TheCompany believes that the presentation allows for comparison of amounts from both taxable and tax - exempt sources and is consistent with industry practices. The FTE adjustment was $234MM , $228MM, $223MM, $215MM and $225MM for 4Q16, 3Q16, 2Q16, 1Q16 and 4Q15, respectively. The Companys fully phased-in Basel 3 estimates and the supplementary leverage ratio are based onthe Standardized and Advanced approaches under Basel 3 and supplementary leverage ratio finalrules. Under the Basel 3 Advanced approaches, risk-weighted assets are determined primarily for market risk and credit risk, similar to the Standardized approach, but also incorporate operational risk and a credit valuation adjustment component. Market risk capital measurements are consistent with the Standardized approach, except for securitization exposures, where the Supervisory Formula Approach is als o permitted. Credit risk exposures are measured using internal ratings-based models to determine the applicable risk weight by estimating the probability of defaul t, loss given default and, in certain instances, exposure at default. The internal analytical models primarily rely on internal historical default and loss experience. The calculations under Basel 3 require management to make estimates, assumptions and interpretations, including the probability of future events based on historical experience. Actual results could differ from those estimates andassumptions. TheseBasel 3 fully phased-in Advanced approaches estimates assume approval by U.S. banking regulators of our internal analytical models, including approval of the internal models methodology (IMM). As ofDecember 31, 2016, BAC did not have regulatory approval for the IMM model. Our estimates under the Basel 3 Advanced approaches may be refined over time as a result of further rulemaking or clai n by U.S. banking regulators. The Company allocates capital to its business segments using a methodology that considers the effect of regulatory capital requirements in addition to internal risk- based capital models. The Company's internal risk-based capital models use a risk-adjusted methodology incorporating each segment's credit, market, interest rate, business and operational risk components. Allocated capital is reviewed periodically and refinements are made based on multiple considerations that include, but are not limited to,risk-weighted assets measured under Basel 3 Standardized and Advanced approaches, business segment exposures and risk profile and strategic plans. As a resultof this process, inthe first quarter 2016, the Company adjusted the amount of capital being allocated to its business segments. 26\" data-src=\"https://staticseekingalpha1.a.ssl.fastly.net/uploads/sa_presentations/377/4377/slides/26.jpg?1484314059\" title=\" Important Presentation Information\"></figure><figure class=\"item\" data-index=\"27\" itemprop=\"image\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"https://schema.org/ImageObject\"><meta content=\"https://staticseekingalpha.a.ssl.fastly.net/uploads/sa_presentations/377/4377/slides/27.jpg?1484314059\" itemprop=\"url\">\n<meta content=\"1280\" itemprop=\"width\">\n<meta content=\"960\" itemprop=\"height\">\n<img data-src=\"https://staticseekingalpha.a.ssl.fastly.net/uploads/sa_presentations/377/4377/slides/27.jpg?1484314059\"></figure><div class=\"press-overlay\"><div class=\"pull-right press-overlay-cnt\">\n<div class=\"pull-left\">Click to enlarge</div>\n<div class=\"pull-right\">\n<!--[if (gt IE 8)|(IEMobile)]><!--><svg height=\"14\" viewbox=\"10.600000381469727 10.5 10.799999237060547 11\" width=\"14\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M14.4 10.5h7v7M17.6 21.5h-7v-7\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"#FFFFFF\" stroke-miterlimit=\"10\" stroke-width=\"2\"></path></svg><!--<![endif]--><!--[if (lt IE 9)&(!IEMobile)]><span></span><![endif]-->\n</div>\n<div class=\"clearfix\"></div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"notes hidden\"><div class=\"note-w\">\n<span class=\"ttl\">Notes:</span> <span class=\"note-ctn\"></span>\n</div></div>\n</div></div>\n<meta itemprop=\"url\" content=\"https://staticseekingalpha1.a.ssl.fastly.net/images/revshare/placeholder.png\"></span></p>"]},

[Operator Instructions] Please note this call is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. Lee McEntire. Please go ahead, sir.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Lee McEntire</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning. Thanks everybody for joining us. I know it\u2019s a busy morning for all of you for the fourth quarter 2016 results. Hopefully, everybody has got a chance to review the earnings release documents that are available on our website. Before I turn the call over to Brian and Paul, let me remind you we may make some forward-looking statements. For further information on those, please refer to our earnings release documents, our website or SEC filings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">With that, let me turn it over to Brian Moynihan, our Chairman and CEO for some opening comments before Paul Donofrio, our CFO goes through the details. Brian?</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning. Thank you, Lee and thank all of you for joining us to review our results today. Results this year in the fourth quarter complete a solid year of execution in driving our responsible growth strategy. We have produced earnings of $17.9 billion in 2016, that\u2019s a 13% growth over 2015. In a year in which we had a series of unexpected and sizable events around the world and a rough start in the capital markets, we are able to achieve 1% growth in revenue against the backdrop of a slow growth U.S. economy. Importantly focused on driving what we could control, cost, production and risk.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">So, how do we do on all that? We lowered our costs to improve productivity, with result in reduction expenses by almost 5% compared to 2015. That\u2019s nearly $3 billion in expense reductions continuing a long-term trend. From their peak in 2011 at $77 billion, expenses are now down $22 billion at 29%. And reductions coupled with the revenue growth drove 6% in operating leverage. In improving economy, a relentless focus on client selection and growth through responsible lending combined to result in a historical low charge-off rate of 39 basis points for our company this quarter. We also returned more capital to shareholders through higher dividends and more share repurchases during 2016.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">As you may have seen in the news release this morning, we announced an additional $1.8 billion expansion to our share buyback program. So adding the $1.8 billion to the $2.5 billion left, that brings us to $4.3 billion for the first 6 months of 2017. Our approach has resulted in a 2% reduction in share count at the end of 2016, which adds to the earnings growth to produce a 15% growth in earnings per share. For the year, our return on tangible common equity was 9.5%, while return on assets was 82 basis points. And the efficiency ratio improved from 70% to 66%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">From a balance sheet perspective, let me mention a few things that are noteworthy as items continued to grow with the business, while optimizing the balance sheet at the same time. Our average deposits grew $64 billion or 5% compared to fourth quarter of \u201815. Our average loans grew $22 billion or 3%, as the lending segments outgrew the legacy runoff and Paul will show you that later on. On regulatory capital, we ended the year at 10.8% on a fully phased-in CET 1 advanced basis. Importantly, after reviewing our year end calculation and through the hard work of our teams, we are pleased to report that our method 2 G-SIB capital ratio requirement has dropped 50 basis points. So, our total 2019 CET 1 requirement is now 9.5%, instead of 10%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Turning to Slide 3, on these charts, you can see that each business segment played a role in driving our earnings growth in 2016. The businesses are producing good efficiency ratios and returns above the firm\u2019s cost of capital. And on this page, you can see that each business is driving hard to create operating leverage in the upper right hand corner. Consumer banking, our biggest earning business, continued its strong performance through its transformation, produced more than $7 billion in after-tax earnings, growing 8%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Our global wealth and investment management business improved its earnings 8% as well, earning $2.8 billion. Our global banking business serving our commercial customers continued to produce strong revenue and generated $5.7 billion of earnings. And lastly, but not leastly, our global markets business earned $3.8 billion, the most it\u2019s earned in the past 5 years, with a rebound in sales and trading revenue and strong expense discipline on the part of the team. As you know and you can see from the slides Paul walked through later, our business has important leadership positions across the board in their industry and we believe that they have room to grow their market shares by focus on deepening relationships with their existing customers as well as winning customers from the competition.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Turning to Slide 4, let me cover a few highlights in the fourth quarter before I turn it over to Paul, reported earnings of $4.7 billion after-tax at $0.40 per diluted share and EPS improvement of 48% from the year ago quarter on a reported basis. We had a couple of pennies and net benefit this quarter from resolutions and tax matters that were partially offset by the combination of smaller charges for revenue, for debt hedge ineffectiveness, additions to our UK card ppi reserves we prepared for sale and DVA. This improvement in the year-over-year results was driven by expense reductions as we lowered costs by 6% from fourth quarter \u201815 to fourth quarter \u201816. Revenue from the fourth quarter \u201815 to fourth quarter \u201816 was up 2% on a reported basis. Note that this quarter had lower levels of non-core gains from equity, debt and asset sales than in past years. So, there is effectively more core earnings. Provision expense was modestly lower in the aggregate from fourth quarter \u201815 as our responsible growth strategy resulted in a 23% improvement in net charge-offs and we also had a lower amount of net reserves release from last year\u2019s fourth quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">So overall, I am pleased with the results. The company has produced another quarter of solid results, with strong operating leverage. We reported year-over-year earnings growth in every quarter of 2016, with expenses declining in every quarter and revenue growing in 3 out of 4. Our focus on operating leverage, expense management and operating excellence continues. The fourth quarter \u201816 represents the 20th successive quarter of year-over-year non-litigation expenses going down. The expense reduction has been an important ability to grow our earnings without the benefit of significant rate increases. But now we see rate increases in the fourth quarter of \u201816 in the latter part of the quarter on both the long end and the short end. As these rate increases were late in the quarter, they didn\u2019t benefit the fourth quarter NII number that\u2019s significant, but we look forward to first quarter \u201817 when we expect NII to all things remaining equal by approximately $600 million per quarter despite having 2 less days in that first quarter. And with loan and deposit growth, we would expect NII to continue to improve from there throughout 2017 and beyond and Paul will take you through these numbers in a minute. This dynamic bodes well as we expect growth and earnings from productivity improvements will now get the added benefits of rate increases.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">This quarter, investors have a lot \u2013 asked a lot of questions that they usually asked, but importantly, questions about the incoming new Presidential administration. Their questions have ranged from corporate tax reform and what do we think about that, regulatory changes, economic growth and the impacts of these things and interest rate changes. The optimism for positive change here at Bank of America and among our customers is palpable and has driven bank stock prices higher. We will have to see how these topics play out, but that we are optimistic and we will continue \u2013 but in the interim, we will continue to operate the company by controlling and driving what we can. We are going to drive responsible growth.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In prior calls, I have sort of answered the questions you are asking about the fundamentals. First, can we continue to stay this discipline on risk? Yes, we are making progress, growing our loans, growing our deposits, growing our market business and keeping the risk in check in all areas. And our credit is among the best it\u2019s ever been in history. Can we get earnings growth in low rate environment? The answer is yes. We are seeing our earnings growth even without significant rise in rates and now we look forward to those rises in rates. And the question is can we keep driving expenses lower? Again, the 20th consecutive quarter of year-over-year lower operating expenses and we have room to move them lower even as we continue a healthy investment across all our businesses. And can we continue to drive our returns up above our cost of capital? And we are seeing that happen. So while we are very optimistic about the future, optimistic about new policies which could spur our growth, we at Bank of America will continue to drive what we can control and that\u2019s a call through what we have and we\u2019ll keep doing that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">With what, I will turn it over to Paul for the fourth quarter results. Paul?</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"><strong>Paul Donofrio</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everybody. Since Brian covered the income statement highlights, I want to start with the balance sheet on Page 5. Overall, the end of period assets declined $8 billion from Q3 as solid loan growth across our business segments was more than offset by lower levels of trading assets in our global markets business. On an ending basis, loans grew $10.9 billion from Q3 \u201816. This includes adding back $9.2 billion in UK card balances that were moved from loans and leases to assets of businesses held for sale pursuant to the announcement of the sale of our UK card business. Loans on a reported basis showed growth of $1.7 billion as a result of that movement. We expect to close the sale around the middle of the year subject to regulatory approvals.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On the funding side, deposits rose $28 billion from Q3 or 9% on an annualized basis. At the same time, long-term debt fell by $8.3 billion, driven by hedge and FX valuations. Global markets trading liabilities declined in tandem with global markets assets. Lastly, common equity declined $3.2 billion compared to Q3, as additions from earnings were offset by a decline in AOCI and capital return to shareholders. AOCI declined by $5.6 billion. Driving the decline was a $4.7 billion reduction in the value of AFA securities held in our investment portfolio, which reduced in value as long-term rates rose significantly during the quarter. Reflecting this, global liquidity sources declined a bit in the quarter and in the year just below $0.5 trillion. However, we remain well compliant with fully phased-in U.S. LCR requirements. We returned a total of $2.1 billion to common shareholders through a combination of dividends and repurchases in the quarter. Return of capital, plus the decline in AOCI, drove a 1% decline relative to Q3 \u201816 in tangible book value per share to $16.95. However, it\u2019s up $1.33 or 9% from Q4 \u201815.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to regulatory metrics and focusing on the advanced approach, our CET 1 transition ratio under Basel III ended the quarter at 11%. On a fully phased-in basis, compared to Q3 \u201816, the CET 1 ratio decreased 12 basis points to 10.8% and remains well above our new 2019 requirement of 9.5%. CET 1 capital declined $3 billion to $163 billion, driven by the negative OCI valuations. Benefiting ratio was a $12 billion decline in RWA driven by lower exposures in our global markets business, partially offset by loan growth. We also provided our capital metrics under the standardized approach, which remain relevant for CCAR comparison. Here, our CET 1 ratio is higher at 11.5%. Supplementary leverage ratios for both the parent and the bank continued to exceed U.S. regulatory minimums that take effect in 2018.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to Slide 6, on an average basis, total loans are up $22 billion or 3% in Q4 \u201815, versus Q3 \u201816 we saw pick up in growth driven by holiday spending on credit cards and some late quarter growth in commercial activity. Looking at loans by business segment and in all other, year-over-year, loans in all other were down $26 billion, driven by continued runoff of first lien and second lien mortgages, while loans in our business segments were up $48 billion or 6%. Consumer banking led with 8% growth. We continued to see growth in residential real estate, as the pipeline from Q3 \u201816 flow-through, vehicle lending was solid, home equity pay-downs and runoff continued to outpace originations. In wealth management, we saw year-over-year growth of 7%, driven by residential real estate. Global banking loans were up 6% year-over-year. And on the bottom right chart, note the $64 billion in year-over-year growth in average deposits that Brian mentioned.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to asset quality on Slide 7, one can see clear evidence of our responsible growth strategy. Credit quality metrics remained strong, perhaps best symbolized by our net charge-off ratio which hit a record low of 39 basis points this quarter. Our strong credit quality metrics are a manifestation of our overall risk management which has been transformed since 2008 and we expect our performance to bode well as we move through economic cycle. Total net charge-offs of $880 million improved slightly from Q3 and are down $264 million from Q4 \u201815. Provision expense of $774 million declined $76 million from Q3 and $36 million from Q4 \u201815. Our net reserve release in the quarter of $106 million was slightly higher than Q3 \u201816, as we released $75 million of energy reserves, given the improvement in asset quality and current stability in energy prices. The Q4 \u201816 total net reserve release was roughly a third the amount released in Q4 \u201815, as consumer real estate releases continue to moderate lower. Our allowance to loan ratio this quarter was 1.26%, with a current coverage level 3x our annual net charge-offs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On Slide 8, we break out credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios. As you can see charge-offs improved in both periods with consumer real estate driving consumer improvement and reduced energy losses driving commercial improvement. We saw improvement in most of our other credit metrics.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning quickly to Slide 9, net interest income on a GAAP non-FTE basis was 10.3 \u2013 $10.5 billion on an FTE basis. Compared to Q4 \u201815, NII this quarter was relatively stable after adding back the $612 million charge we incurred last year when we called some troughs securities. Compared to Q3 \u201816, NII was up $91 million. NII benefited in the quarter from solid loan and deposit growth. We also saw some modest benefit in NII from higher interest rates. Partially offsetting these benefits was market based hedge and effectiveness totaling $169 million related to the accounting for our long-term debt and associated swaps where we have swapped interest payments from fix to floating. This ineffectiveness is recorded in NII and will revert to zero over the remaining life of the debt. It is just a timing issue caused by accounting rules.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Although I am not likely to give specific NII guidance in most quarters, the moving Q1 \u201817 is expected to be significant. So we wanted to provide some near-term perspective. As you think about Q1 \u201817 versus Q4 \u201816, the benefit from the absence of negative market related ineffectiveness will be offset by two less days in the quarter, so you can effectively take this quarter\u2019s NII as a starting point. Now assuming interest rates remain at current levels and we see modest loan and deposit growth, we believe we will earn approximately $600 million in additional NII in Q1, primarily driven by the Q4 rate increases in both the long and short end. From there, we would expect continued growth in 2017, assuming modest loan and deposit growth and stable short-term and long-term interest rates. With respect to asset sensitivity as at 12/31 and instantaneous 100 basis point parallel increase in rates, it is estimated to increase NII by $3.4 billion over the subsequent 12 months.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Turning to Slide 10, non-interest expense was $13.2 billion. That\u2019s an improvement of more than $800 million or 6% from Q4 \u201815 and as you can see, the reductions are across the company and in virtually all line items of expense. Our productivity projects and efforts to simplify how we get our work done and how we deliver for our clients are driving these reductions. Q4 litigation expense was $246 million, which is fairly consistent with Q3 \u201816, but lower than the $400 million recorded in Q4 \u201815. Our employee base declined 2% from Q4 \u201815. However, we continued to invest in growth by adding primary sales associates across consumer, across wealth management and across global banking. As a reminder in Q1, similar to past years, we expect to incur roughly $1.3 billion for retirement eligible incentives and seasonally elevated payroll tax expense. Additionally, if we were to see a normal seasonal rebound in capital markets based activity, we would most likely see an associated increase in expense.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Turning to the business segments and starting with consumer banking on Slide 11. This business is generating above average deposit growth, solid loan growth, improving customer satisfaction and strong growth in earnings. Consumer banking earned $1.9 billion and produced a 22% return on allocated capital this quarter. I would note that pretax, pre-provision earnings rose more than $400 million or 12%. 7% expensed and 5% NII improvement were both notable and enough to more than offset higher provision expense and prior year divestiture gains. Revenue was up 1% compared to Q4 \u201815, as NII growth was partially offset by the absence of approximately $100 million of divestiture gains in Q4 \u201815 as we sold the last of our larger non-core affiliate portfolios in that quarter. Credit quality remains good and provision was higher primarily as a result of reserve releases in the year ago quarter. Consumer continued to lower expenses and the efficiency ratio dropped nearly 500 basis points to 53% from Q4 \u201815. With good pricing discipline, prepaid on deposits remained a steady 4 basis points and the operating cost of deposits was also steady at 160 basis points.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Turning to Slide 12 and looking at key trends, first in the upper left, the stats are a reminder of our strong competitive position. Looking a little closer at revenue \u2013 excuse me, looking a little closer at the revenue drivers compared to Q4 \u201815, while we report NII and non-interest revenue separately, it is important to emphasize again that our strategy is to focus on relationship deepening and growing total revenue, while improving operating leverage through expense discipline. Our relationship deepening is improving NII and balanced growth, while holding the fee line flat as we reward customers for doing more business with us. We believe the overall result is the more satisfied customers whose balances are more sticky over time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We continue to see strong client enrollment in our preferred rewards programs. For the year, we enrolled 1.2 million clients in preferred rewards and that\u2019s up 42% from 2015. We are seeing a 99% retention rate for customers enrolled in preferred reward. Average deposits continued their strong growth, up $54 billion or 10% year-over-year outpacing the industry. With respect to card, spending levels and new issuances were strong. However, the industry trend of increasing reward costs continues to mitigate our overall card revenue growth. By the way, this makes it even more important to hold down acquisition costs through the use of our branch network to source and fulfill customer demand. I would also emphasize that our underwriting standards in card results in a relatively higher quality new card customers that on the one hand have higher spending habits, but on the other hand, receive more rewards.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Turning to expenses in the upper right, they declined 7% in Q4 \u201815 despite higher FDIC assessment charges between the two periods. Digitalization and other productivity improvements continued to help us drive down costs in our delivery network. Focusing on client balances on the left, in addition to deposit growth, client brokerage assets at $145 billion are up 18% versus Q4 \u201815 on strong account flows and market valuations. We also increased the number of Merrill Edge accounts by 11% versus Q4 \u201815. We now have more than 1.7 million households that leverage our financial solution advisors and self-directed investing platforms.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Moving across the bottom of the page, note that the average loans are up 8% from Q4 \u201815 on strong mortgage and vehicle lending growth. Loan growth reflected total consumer real estate production of $22 billion, up 29% from Q4 \u201815 and 7% higher than Q3 \u201816 as the prior quarter\u2019s pipeline came through. We retained about three-quarters of first mortgage production on the balance sheet this quarter. As you might imagine, the sudden rise in long-term rates caused a noticeable decline in applications to refinance, driving the overall mortgage pipeline down 43% from the end of Q3. Auto lending was up 15% from Q4 \u201815, with average booked FICO scores remaining well above 750 and net losses of 35 basis points. On U.S. consumer card, average balances grew from Q3 aided by seasonal holiday spending. And spending on our credit cards adjusted for divestitures was up 10% compared to Q4 \u201815.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay. Turning to Slide 13, we remain an established leader in digital banking. With improvements like our Spanish app and contactless sign in, we continue to see momentum in digital banking adoption. Mobile banking continues to transform how our customers bank and we expect to introduce our artificial intelligence application, Erica, this year. She will add to both the functionality and excitement around digital banking. Importantly, as adoption rises, particularly around transaction processing and self-service, we expect to see efficiency and customer satisfaction improve.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">I won\u2019t go through all the details on this slide, but mobile devices now represent 19% of all deposit transactions and represent the volume of more than 880 financial centers. Sales on digital devices continued to grow and now represent 20% of total sales. While these trends were important and continued to transform how consumers interact with us, I would remind you that we still have nearly 1 million people a day walking into our financial centers across the U.S. Many of these customers still use our branches to transact, but many also use the branch as a financial destination where they can learn more about products and services, work face-to-face with a specialized professional and generally improve their financial lives.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Turning to Slide 14, global wealth and investment management produced earnings of $634 million, which is up modestly from Q4 \u201815 on solid operating leverage. The business continues to undergo meaningful change as firms and clients adapt to the new fiduciary rules and other market dynamics. We remain well positioned with market-leading brands and a wide range of investment service options ranging from fully advised to self-directed, with Guided Investing for those who want something in between. We also have strong margins and returns as well as resources to help us manage through market dynamics and customer trends.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Year-over-year, non-interest income declined $104 million as higher asset management fees were more than offset by lower transactional revenue. A 4% decline year-over-year on expenses drove 170 basis point improvement in operating leverage from Q4 \u201815. The decline was driven by the expiration of the amortization of advisor retention rewards that were put in place at the time of the Merrill Lynch merger. Other declines were the result of work across many categories of expense more than offsetting higher litigation and FDIC costs compared to last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Moving to Slide 15, we continue to see overall solid client engagement. Client balances climbed over \u2013 they climbed to $2.5 trillion driven by market values, solid long-term AUM flows, and continued loan and deposit growth. $19 billion of long-term AUM flows include clients transferring assets from AUM, client transferring assets to AUM from ROA brokerage. Average deposits of $257 billion were up 2% from Q4 \u201815. Average loans of $146 billion were up 7% year-over-year. Growth remained concentrated in consumer real estate.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Turning to Slide 16, global banking earned $1.6 billion, which was up 11% year-over-year. Global banking continues to drive loan growth within its risk and client frameworks, continued stabilization in oil prices and improvement in exposures drove provision expense lower in Q4 \u201816. Investment banking fees were down 4% from Q4 \u201815 as strong debt underwriting activity was more than offset by a lower advisory and equity issuance fees. Expenses decreased from Q4 \u201815 despite the addition of new commercial and business bankers and increased FDIC costs. The efficiency ratio improved to 45% in Q4. Return on allocated capital increased to 17%, despite adding a couple of billion dollars of allocated capital this year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Looking at trends on Slide 17 and comparing Q4 last year. Relative to Q3 \u201816, we saw a pickup in lending, with average loans on a year-over-year basis up $19 billion or 6%. Growth was broad-based across large corporates and middle-market borrowers and it was diversified across industries. Average deposits increased from Q4 \u201815, up $6 billion or 2% from both new and existing clients.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Switching to global markets on Slide 18, the business had another solid quarter. Given our broad product and geographic footprint, we were well-positioned to help clients address volatility around the elections and central bank policy uncertainty, both in the U.S. and abroad. We continue to invest in and enjoy leadership positions across a broad range of products. This business is another great example of our focus on improving operating leverage. Revenue grew 8%, excluding net DVA, while expenses declined 10%. Global markets earned $658 million and returned 7% on allocated capital in what is typically the most seasonally challenged quarter of the year. For the year, the return on allocated capital was 10%, as sales and trading revenue ex-DVA grew 5%, while expense declined. It is worth noting that we achieved these results with a stable balance sheet, lower VAR and 7% fewer people. Continued expense discipline drove costs 10% lower year-over-year, led by reductions in operating and support costs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Moving to trends on Slide 19 and focusing on the components of our sales and trading performance. Sales and trading revenue of $2.9 billion, excluding DVA, was up 11% from Q4 \u201815, driven by FICC. In terms of revenue, while we experienced a normal seasonal decline versus Q3, this Q4 was our second best fourth quarter in 5 years. Excluding net DVA and versus Q4 \u201815, fix sales and trading of $2 billion increased 12%. Mortgages showed particular strength among the credit products as investors sought yield. It was a challenging market for municipals. With the exception of rates, we saw an improvement in trading of macro products. Equity sales and trading was solid at $948 million, up 7% versus Q4 \u201815. Flows were strong in the second half of the quarter, driven by a challenging \u2013 excuse me, driven by a changing investor sentiment after the U.S. elections, which drove a favorable environment for derivatives as clients repositioned across industries. We were able to help many clients who are underweight equities leading up to the election at exposure.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">On Slide 20 we show all other, which reported a net loss of $95 million. This quarter includes a $132 million charge to add to our PPI reserve. You will also note that this quarter includes no debt security gains. Equity investment income was only $56 million and there was little to no gains from asset sales. Given the increase in rates and our progress with respect to reducing non-core assets, this quarter\u2019s results are more reflective of future trends with respect to these two line items. All other\u2019s Q4 \u201816 loss includes a net benefit from some tax matters of roughly $500 million, which reduced our tax rate in the quarter to 22%. Excluding those matters, the effective tax rate would have been about 31%. I would expect a similar tax rate of 31% for the average for 2017, excluding unusual items.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. Let me editorialize a little bit as I finish here. We reported solid results this quarter that capped a year filled with improvement. These results show that our strategy of responsible growth is working. One can see responsible growth in our deposit growth, while maintaining good pricing discipline. You can see it in the reduction in our expenses, even as we continued to invest in the future of the franchise. And you can see it in the deepening of relationships with our customers and clients. Our focus on responsible growth is helping us return more capital to shareholders and today\u2019s announcement of an increase in our share repurchase authorization is another example of that. Responsible growth has also driven the transformation of our risk profile, which is evident in our credit risk metrics and something we believe will differentiate us through future economic cycles. And responsible growth is driving operating leverage, which is visible in each of our lines of businesses. Lastly, responsible growth has put us in a solid position to benefit in 2017 from higher interest rates.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">With that, I will it open up to Q&amp;A.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p8\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Your line is open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hi, good morning. Paul, I was wondering if you could give us a little more split, some of the drivers of the net interest income increase that you are expecting to recur between the fourth and first quarter, the $600 million, how much is that is driven by the Fed hike we saw on the short end and how much of it might be the long end in rates versus loan growth?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Sure. Let me \u2013 maybe the simplest way to sort of answer that question would be to take you back to 9/30, right, when the inter-sensitivity on the long end was $2.1 billion. We saw 75 basis point increase in long end rates since then, so 75 basis points times $2.1 billion is $1.6 billion. At that time, the short end sensitivity was $3.3 billion. We saw 25% of 1%, 25 basis points. So $3.3 billion times 25%, that\u2019s another $600 million. So together, that\u2019s $2.4 billion. As you can see, just in the changes in the interest sensitivity, you divided by 4, you get your $600 million. Again, I would emphasize that we see NII growing from there as we moved to \u201817 assuming again we have modest loan growth, modest deposit growth and a stable short-term and long-term interest rate environment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. And then the reason the 5.3 future sensitivity has now moved to 3.4 as you have rolled $2 billion into your base case outlook?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yes. Conceptually, we have captured the decline in sensitivity. We are going to capture the decline in sensitivity that you just experienced in our NII over the next 12 months and you can see that under the calculation I just did for you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay, got it, that\u2019s helpful. Then a question for Brian on capital return and CCAR, some of the other banks have used the de minimis exception that kind of top off their 2016 CCAR authorizations. That leaves Bank of America standing out quite a bit on the low end of payouts versus peers, so I am kind of wondering \u2013 two questions, one how do you guys think about that de minimis, you did well in 2016, any reason that Bank of America couldn\u2019t think about the de minimis top off or their restrictions on that or could you do that at some point this year on the de minimis. And then second, as you move into 2017, what are your goals to get your capital distributions closer to peer payouts and why wouldn\u2019t you be able to do that? Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yes. John, so this morning and as part of our release, we announced that we got approval for de minimis of $1.8 billion, that\u2019s the $2.5 billion we have for the first half of this year to bring the repurchased volume for \u2013 to $4.3 billion for the first half year. So we applied to that obviously in December and got the approval and our Board has approved it. Now it went out with the release this morning. In terms of next year, we will see what the scenarios are, the dollar caveats, but you are seen us constantly move our numbers up and we will continue to do that in our \u2013 our cushions and stuff are strong on the earnings, but the most important thing for us was kind of getting to make sure the earnings power of the company kept coming back and now with $17 billion earnings, we feel confident we will be able to push forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And John, that $1.8 billion was the full 1%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Great. And that\u2019s that will take you through \u2013 just as a reminder Paul, that will take you through the end of the CCAR period, right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Right. The first two quarters, all in the first half year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Great. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yes. Hi, good morning. Maybe I will just follow-up on the NII question a little bit, does that guidance that you provided include the sale of the UK card business and what\u2019s sort of the impact from that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yes. The guidance includes the sale of the UK card business. But just to be clear, that\u2019s not going to close until probably mid this year. And so that NII will be with us until it does \u2013 until it closes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Sure. So when we think about going forward, what kind of deposit betas you are assuming in that $600 million per quarter and how do we think about the next rate hike, say we get one in June, which seems to be consensus, do you still expect to have very low positive betas from there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yes. So if you \u2013 again, if you go back to 9/30, I think we told you we were using deposit betas in our modeling on interest bearing deposits in the high 40s. And we said, hey, the first few rate hikes is going to be less. And the later rate hikes, it\u2019s going to be more. And that\u2019s kind of what we are experiencing. So if you kind of look at our deposit betas right now, you probably see it kind of inching into the 50s. It\u2019s definitely moving up as we get more short-term rate hikes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And do you think that continue into third \u2013 the next rate hike?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Well, again I think \u2013 well, we will see what happens here, right. I mean we had a rate hike a year ago. And I think a number of people would have said that we would had a pass around I think there was a significant pass-through in the industry. We just had a rate hike in December and we are going to see how much capacity we actually have. From a modeling perspective, in that guidance I gave you, from a modeling perspective, the pass-through rate on the next 100 basis points would be in the 50s. And again, it would be the same story, less in the beginning, more at the end.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yes, understood. Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And our next question is from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Hello, there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Good morning, Glenn.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Good morning. Two quickies. One on card, one on mortgage. On cards, you had some pretty good growth and we are seeing really big growth at some of the other big banks and some of the economics of the business are being given way to support that growth. I am just curious on how you are balancing that of customer growth versus giving up some of the economics to capture that growth?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Well, I think the way to think about it, Glenn, overall, is that we are doing on a customer basis. So when we \u2013 Paul gave you the statistics earlier for the preferred rewards enrollments and things like that, we are driving \u2013 our priorities are to get our card used by our core customers and reward them for that, who have other deeper relationships with the company. And so in a broad sense, we are getting paid through the NII line as well as in the other relationships they had as well as the card income fee line that you see on deposit balances and other things plus obviously the card balances. We have been pleased that we now have gotten through all the sales when you think about this quarter versus last year. And so active accounts are moving up I think 2% or 3% or so year-over-year. The active accounts were up, which shows the strategy is working. So while we make that investment you are talking about and that is part of the competitive dynamics. We feel good about the balances growing. So, we are getting more NII from it. But importantly, with our customers, these are the best customers we have and so we are seeing their other aspects of relationship grow.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And again, look, strong risk adjusted margins in that business is stable for us, above 9%. Charge-offs look great. And as Brian said, we are staying at the higher end of the market.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes, it\u2019s super ROA and ROE support of anyway for the overall company. And then the question on mortgage was, the production was good, but the pipeline fell a lot, obviously, a function of what happened in rates, but can you help us to think about what to expect, say, next year if say rates go up along the forward yield curve? Like how do you model that? How you can manage the expense along the way?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I think if you look at the page, Glenn that showed the quarterly production in the consumer section there, you see that I think it was three quarters over the last three quarters all over $20 billion in home mortgage loans and home equity loans. Look, you wouldn\u2019t know from the outside is during the last year, we have made a series of major changes in that business. We have consolidated the internal platform, so we have one group, a fellow named Steve Boland who does good job for us delivering the product across all the businesses, whether it\u2019s U.S. Trust, Merrill Lynch or the consumer business. In addition, we have brought in the servicing from third-parties of our customers and we continue to do that. So even in the year, we have made tremendous transformations even saw $320 billion plus. And so our view \u2013 the team would tell me that the pipeline will be down, because refinances are down and therefore expect less, but I think my view is that they should be able to continue to grow market share frankly because of the capacity that they were able to develop this year given those changes and still produce well. That being said, it\u2019s a rate sensitive product. So, we have told you, think about the mortgage banking income line as $300 odd million is a little higher this quarter just because some of the dynamics. So, it\u2019s a relatively modest line, but the production will be strong.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay, thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">The next question is from Steven Chubak with Instinet. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Hi, good morning. So Paul, I wanted to start off with a question on the FICC business. The revenues have been remarkably resilient over the last couple of years really helped by some of the factors that you cited whether it would be strong risk discipline, balance sheet management and the reduction in VAR. But as we look ahead, what we have been hearing from a lot of folks is growing optimism around the FICC business in the coming year. And what I am wondering is, whether your strong risk discipline actually precludes you from participating in a significant recovery if then materializes to the same extent that some of your peers?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Look, we feel \u2013 as you point out, look, we feel really great about that business. It is performing very well. We know \u2013 I would note the operating leverage we are getting, I would note our \u2013 as you said that our discipline on risk and the reduction of VAR. So we have no complaints. We have a diversified product set that has a global geographic footprint. We have scale in every major market around the world. And when you look at global banking and global markets together, I would argue that only three companies in the world can deliver what we can deliver for our clients and customers in every major market around the world. So, there is tremendous opportunity there. We are not going to look exactly like every competitor every quarter. We have often said that when things are great, we might not be as high, but when things aren\u2019t so good, we are not going to be as low. So, we are not \u2013 we feel great about it, but \u2013 and we think there is lots of opportunity and we would expect continued performance in that business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Got it. And switching over to just the capital side for a moment, I mean, you highlighted the progress you made in reducing the G-SIB surcharge 2.5. And I am wondering as you think about how you are going to allocate capital across the different businesses, whether that positions you to reduce your firm-wide targets or you \u2013 and maybe more specifically, how are you thinking about your spot capital requirement today for the firm overall?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Well, I am not sure I understand the question. In terms of \u2013 so, let\u2019s just talk about it a bit. In terms of the allocation of capital, that\u2019s a process we go through once a year. We look at a number of different metrics, return on \u2013 advanced approach, standardized approach, SLR. We look at internal models, economic capital and we arrive at we think is the right amount of capital to give to our businesses based upon their business operations and risk. Remember, we have got $500 billion of operational risk capital that was assigned to us by the regulators. From my perspective, personal perspective, most of that is for businesses that we are no longer in, products that we no longer sell, risk that we no longer take. So a big chunk of that sits in all other and it wouldn\u2019t really be appropriate to push it from a segment standpoint out to the businesses, because they are not really using that risk capital. So, is that what you are looking for or was there some other element of that question that I missed?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Well, I think the tricky part there and admittedly, it\u2019s a complex topic is thinking about how much capital you need to get through the CCAR process unscathed or maybe under the new SEB framework, how \u2013 like what\u2019s the minimum capital requirement that you would need over which you can \u2013 the remainder is considered to be excess and can be returned to shareholders over time?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes. We feel \u2013 look, we have made a lot of progress in CCAR. We have made \u2013 the progress we have really seen in the company \u2013 there is lots of technical things we have done to be much better on CCAR in terms of improving how we do it, involving everybody in the company, the qualitative aspects of it. I think from a quantitative standpoint, we have always looked like we have had enough capital. I think if you look at our stress losses relative to competitors, you can see responsible growth in \u2013 coming out in the Fed\u2019s models, not our models. And so I think we feel really good quantitatively. I think we feel really good qualitatively. If you look at the stress capital buffer, that\u2019s not going to impact capital for us, where we are probably \u2013 we would have to see how all the rules \u2013 this was a speech, so we don\u2019t really know what all the rules are going to say. But my guess is we are \u2013 our stress capital buffer is below the minimum that would be required, so we feel like we are in a good position for CCAR \u201817. We don\u2019t know what the scenarios yet. We don\u2019t know what the rules are. So, there is a lot still changing, but we feel really good about the progress we have made, and certainly, our cushion from a quantitative standpoint.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Alright. Thanks for taking my questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Our next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Hi, good morning. Hi, couple of questions. One is on just the balance sheet and as you think about your cash duration, just the profile that you have today in a rising rate environment over time, do you expect to stay more static where you are today or any changes that we should be anticipating?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I don\u2019t think you should anticipate any changes. We haven\u2019t changed since rates started rising. We feel good about the way we are. We are very focused on hitting on our balance sheet. Deposits come in, that\u2019s what really drives the size of the balance sheet, deposits come in, and the question is, within our risk framework, can we put those deposits to work with our customers and clients around the world? If we can, we put it to work within our risk framework. If we can\u2019t, it goes into some other place, either cash or the investment portfolio. We are not really thinking \u2013 and we are always balancing liquidity, earnings and capital, but we are not really sitting there every quarter talking \u2013 figuring out what the most optimum duration is for us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And then just from the cash perspective, the LCR, could you just give us a little color as to where you stand there and\u2026?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">We are in very good shape.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So I hear you on that and it sounds like, okay, we have some excess cash and I guess that\u2019s part of the reason I asked the question, is there any interest in moving some of that cash into?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Well, yes, but LCR isn\u2019t just cash. I mean LCR includes highly \u2013 lots of different securities go into the LCR calculation. Betsy, to make it simple, when the excess of cash coming in over loan growth goes sort of half into mortgage backed securities and half into treasuries at this point. And we \u2013 the duration of what we do on treasuries will be a little bit based on where we think rates are going and stuff like that, but it\u2019s driven \u2013 it just it goes in those two things because we have \u2013 once we fund the loan balance, that\u2019s where it goes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">We are not trying to hold, Betsy more cash than we need.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes, that\u2019s good to hear. Other question was just on the improvement in the minimum capital ratio and the RWA reduction that drove that, could you just give us a little more color on the drivers there and do you feel like you are optimized now for what you want to take in terms of risk relative to total size balance sheet?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes, sure. So as I think Brian mentioned, I mentioned, we took the G-SIB buffer down 50 basis points. It\u2019s at 9.5%, again compared to 10.8% on a fully phased-in basis, so that\u2019s 130 sort of basis points of sort of cushion at this point. We got there through things like reducing derivative notionals through risk less trade compressions. We got there by lowering Level 3 assets, as well as overall optimization as the rules became a little bit more clearer. So we have been working at this for some time. You have asked in other calls, I think other people will have asked, we haven\u2019t really wanted to declare where we were, but now we got to the end of the year, this is one of the calculation really matters, so we thought it was important just to disclose that progress. I would also say that global markets, it\u2019s going to be up and down in any given quarter. Ending balances in the third quarter were up. They were a little bit less in the end of the fourth quarter just on client activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Great, okay. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">The next question is from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Thank you. When you think about rate sensitivity in deposit betas, you get back to really deposit flows, we continued to see increases in deposit balances and until we see any pressure of those balances being kind of deployed back into the economy, there really shouldn\u2019t be much impact on pricing, what is \u2013 you are looking at the core deposit balances and kind of what are the flows you are seeing and where is that growth coming from and are you seeing any pressure in a sense of thinking of those balances being deployed back into the economy?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Well, Marty, we \u2013 so let\u2019s start. We saw a $50-odd billion of deposit growth year-over-year. Consumer business was the lion\u2019s share of that. To give you a sense, fourth quarter \u201815 to fourth quarter \u201816, checking balance in the consumer business grew 12%, so the growth is strong. And as you said, we expect to maintain pricing discipline in the company, not \u2013 obviously, those are non-interest bearing, but on the interest bearing side. So \u2013 and you have seen that so far as the first couple of \u2013 the first rate happened last year. In terms of deployment economy, we made $20 billion more loans, And we will continue to drive the economy and we can will invest in mortgage backed securities and things like that, so we are able to fund easily all the loan demand that we think is responsible to take on. And in the fourth quarter, we saw loan growth in our commercial business kicked up draws on lines, stayed at a high level. And loan growth in the middle market business was strong in the fourth quarter and we are looking forward for more of that in our small business. So you are exactly right, we are deploying the economy. There is not a lot of \u2013 they are growing faster than loans and we believe that we can price with discipline.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And then on just two kind of unusual things out there, the hedge ineffectiveness, can you give us the actual dollar amount, it looks like the day count will typically impact you about $150 million to $200 million. And then other fee income looks artificially low, if you could just give us some color on that line item as well?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Sure. So the hedging ineffectiveness was $168 million in the quarter and negative obviously. And in terms of the other \u2013 you termed the income line.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Other fee income?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So that last quarter, let me give you the sense. Last quarter, we had I think some \u2013 that line is going to bounce around a little bit, let me start with that. But the last quarter, we had some positive impacts in that line from loans related to our FBO portfolio. This quarter, it was negatively impacted by the UK PPI provision. That was $132 million and that\u2019s non-tax deductible. So look, if you adjust for just two items, we would be around $300 million. And I would say that\u2019s probably a good base for you to think about if you are modeling.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Perfect. That\u2019s \u2013 we were right in that range, so that got us right back to the normal level. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And we will go next to Mike Mayo with CLSA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Good morning Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Hi. So there is certainly a lot of positives on this call, whether its deposits, loans, expenses, etcetera, but the end result, it\u2019s still a single digit return on equity, a return on tangible common equity and I know you wanted to be higher, I know it\u2019s improved, but it\u2019s still below your peers today at 13% and below your target of 10%, so can you give us a target metric for RoTCE for 2017 or when do you think you get to that double-digit range where some of your peers are?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So thank you, Mike for noticing the improvement because we feel really good about all the progress we have made. As you point out, earnings I mean are up year-over-year on a 15% and that\u2019s on the very significant earning base of $18 billion. We need to get our capital down. We are returning more capital to shareholders. That\u2019s going to help. We need to continue to grow. So we feel really good about the progress that we have made. Our return on assets metric is tracking in the right direction. Our return on tangible common equity metrics is tracking in the right direction. So we will just have to wait and see. I think we would get there even without a rate rise eventually, but certainly rate rise is going to help.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Well, as a follow-up, I know I ask this each year, but I mean you just said wait and see and that\u2019s kind of been the answer. Is it just seems like from an investor standpoint, you get a free pass, like you will get to the double-digit RoTCE when you get there and as investors were just going to have to wait and see, I just \u2013 it would be nice to have that metric or more color or just anything else you can give along these lines. And maybe just more of that color, the efficiency ratio, I got it, you have gotten better, but still not where I think you want to be at 66% and your peers today, they have reported 60% for last year, what else can you do with the efficiency which might help improve that RoTCE to a double-digit range?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Mike, a couple of things, one is, if you look across the last three quarters, the return on tangible common equity was 10.5%, 10.28%, 9.92%, so you have a fourth quarter seasonal decline in trading, so it\u2019ll pick back up in the first quarter and we look forward to that going back up. And on the efficiency, we have told that \u2013 set the goal of $53 billion in expenses. And whether the rate increases, we will continue to drive that down. And if you look through the year-over-year, it was down from 70 into 66. In the last couple of quarters, have grown to sub-65, around 65 and it will continue to move from there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. Last follow-up, you have come a long way with branches from 6,000 down to 4,600, where do you think you ultimately could take that branch count and why all of a sudden are you reducing the level of ATMs?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Well, the ATMs are coming down, largely because as you reduce branches, there is one or two and then third-party ATMs in places that aren\u2019t very efficient. So they will continue to wind down, so I wouldn\u2019t necessarily focus on that as being a separate question and so we build them out. But if you think about the \u2013 on the branch, we are down. Through the year, we had 179 that closed, but we also renovated 205, put out 34 new ones. So we are continuing to invest, yet there is a steady downdraft in the total branch count. So I think we ended the year at 4,500, almost 4,579. So we will continue to work that count down. Again, based on how the customer flows go. These are critical to serve the customers and so we will end up as larger branches and smaller branches that are being folded in and we will continue to do that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yes. I think as you look at \u2013 think about that number, my focus on the active mobile users, because that\u2019s going to be the interplay here. We have got \u2013 active mobile users are up 16% year-over-year. On a big base, we grew active mobile users more than we grew in 2015. And deposit transactions are now 19 \u2013 mobile deposit transactions are now 19% of all deposit transactions, that\u2019s the equivalent of 880 financial centers, but \u2013 so that\u2019s \u2013 on the one hand, that says maybe you can optimize a little more, but on the other hand, as I said in the lead in, we still have 1 million people, almost 1 million people coming to the branch everyday and they need that channel. They need it to transact some of them. But a lot of them come in for advise and we want them to do that. So, we need a certain footprint of financial centers. I think Brian alluded to the fact that we are adding financial centers all around the country in certain markets around the country. So, it\u2019s going to ebb and flow.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Alright. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And the next question is from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Brian, maybe a question for you, I noticed on Slide 19, the breakout of the global markets revenue mix, 40% of the revenue in the past year coming from outside the U.S. and Canada. As we look towards what appears to be a potentially more volatile market condition in Europe relative to the Brexit negotiations which are set to start early in 2017, how are you thinking about that and what the effect could be on your sales and trading revenue in 2017?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Alright. But I think there is already \u2013 there is volatility this year around it just on the announced vote and things like that. Earlier in the year, that was one of the events that I referenced. The nice thing of the balance in this business when you think about it, so it\u2019s balanced by product, it\u2019s balanced by geography. So when one thing goes, there is something else that\u2019s going well, we pick it up. So, I am not overly worried about \u2013 we have got to get Brexit right as our company and industry and everything and there is a lot of discussion about that. But in terms of the impact on the trading revenue on a given day, it will ebb and flow and we will get through it. But the good news is as the United States strengthens in the first part of the year, we have seen a good normal first quarter developing, and we have seen customer activity strong, all of which bodes well. So we will get through it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. And then if I can just follow-up on your earlier comments about the post-election positive sentiment. Can you give a little more color as to what your borrowers and what your corporate clients are saying in terms of what their demand, the increase in their demand could be or are they holding back a little bit waiting to see what comes out of the Beltway over the next 6 to 9 months?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">What I\u2019d reflect on is that as you came from \u2013 through the summer into the fall through the election, you saw both on the consumer side and commercial side, you saw increasing optimism. On the consumer side, you saw a bit of an acceleration in spending coming into the fall. And so just if you think about the middle-market business, as I said earlier, the revolver utilization is on the high end of where it\u2019s been the past several years at 40% plus in a \u2013 that group, which is our middle-market business, a commercial real estate business, etcetera, at about $4 billion with loans in quarter four, so all that really relates to greater business confidence. And so I think we feel very good where businesses stand and if you get the same reports in the small business side, so they are very \u2013 as I go out and visit these clients, they are very optimistic. They think policies will be supportive of growth in their businesses. And they are facing all the things that we face. Can they find the good employees? Can they find the final demand? But I think overall, the optimism is very strong. And we are seeing it translate into some loan balances. I think it\u2019s still \u2013 will play out into early next year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Next question is from Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thanks. Two quick questions, please. One is on the \u2013 can you just perhaps update us on your outlook for auto credit? It\u2019s been an issue that\u2019s been a bit of a battleground, particularly on the mid and low FICO range? And I know that\u2019s not where you are concentrated, but I would love to get your perspective there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So we have got market share around 3.5% and we are originating in prime and super-prime with average FICO scores at 7.71 and debt to income ratio was at sort of all-time lows. And if you \u2013 and I know this isn\u2019t necessarily completely responsive to your question, but credit statistics here are phenomenal. I think in the quarter, our net charge-off ratio was 19 basis points. So we are able to grow that and we did grow it in the quarter well and we are able to grow it within our risk tolerance. Now the fourth quarter was a great quarter or not, though I think we have all seen the numbers and we are expecting that growth to continue assuming a modestly improving economy, we are expecting that growth to continue in the first and second quarter I guess as guidance I would give you kind of auto growth in sort of mid to low single-digits. By the way, I have just been corrected here. Our net charge-off ratio in the fourth quarter was 35 basis points, not 19, but still well, well within our risk tolerance for that product.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And does the potential decline in collateral values present any particular concern to you, guys?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">It presents a concern and you watch it carefully, but where we keep our business because how we view this business is it\u2019s a very high credit quality business. It hasn\u2019t affected us, as Paul just said, but we see it in the industry and it\u2019s obviously a concern, but there is always some seasonality to those recoveries and those statistics reported, but overall, with our high FICOs are 7.70ish range, so it\u2019s not really \u2013 it doesn\u2019t really affect us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And just one quick follow-up on capital return, I just want to make sure I understand all the dynamics. It seems that there is two trends that are coinciding. One, of course, is the continued increase in targeted payout ratio as a percent of your earnings. And then, of course, there is the expansion in earning of themselves, is that the right way to think about it and is there ever any dynamic to consider?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">You have it right. Well, actually, the only thing I would add is the process itself in terms of the scenarios and things like that, but we have had plenty of cushion, so unless they change dramatically, you\u2019ve got it right.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Our next question is from Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Paul Miller</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Hey, thank you very much and good quarter guys. Talking about mortgage banking a little bit, you talked about that you did about $22 billion of originations in the quarter. And correct me if I am wrong, Brian, but did you mention that your portfolio three quarters of that on to the portfolio? And if you did, what was the breakout between jumbos, just a rough estimate between jumbos and regular conforming or were they all jumbos?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Yes. So, we balance sheet I think, to be precise, 78% this quarter. And we generally balance sheet all of the jumbos. So then the question is for conforming how much do we do, I don\u2019t really have that in front of me. We are starting to do more conforming, but we are certainly not doing all of it, maybe a good guess would be around half.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay. Paul, just to think about that a second, that credit quality mortgages is so strong that frankly it\u2019s not worth getting the guarantees and things like that, we have the liquidity to fund them and it\u2019s obviously jumbos, but even on conforming, the credit quality of ours is at the top end and I think the charge-off ratio was 3 basis points in the fourth quarter. So economic, it\u2019s better to keep them the pay for the guarantee.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Paul Miller</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Now we are seeing a lot more people portfolio before what you just said because the guarantees are so expensive, is the PHH, is that all now consolidated down into your operations, the PHH stuff from Merrill Lynch that you brought over?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Yes, we are getting \u2013 it\u2019s finished up and we are still working through the last part of the conversion, but it\u2019s basically in-house.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Paul Miller</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay. Hey, guys, thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Our next question is from Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O\u2019Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Good morning, Matt.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O\u2019Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Sorry if I missed it, but did you guys comment on the $53 billion expense target that you put out there, I think it\u2019s exiting 2018 was what you said?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">It\u2019s still good.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O\u2019Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay. So even if revenue is better than expected, but it\u2019s rate-driven, that\u2019s not going to impact expenses materially?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Yes. It\u2019s still good and we still target that. And you are exactly right, rate increases will go to the bottom line.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O\u2019Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay. And then separately, credit quality overall is very good, the charge-offs, the non-performers. You did flag the \u2013 I think the non-guaranteed consumer early delinquencies, I think it was about 15% 2Q and a little bit year-over-year, just anything to flag there, especially given how quality of the consumer book is?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yes. That was the transfer of servicing that we just talked about on the previous question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O\u2019Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Apologies about that. Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">No, that\u2019s good question, but it\u2019s \u2013 we transferred servicing at the end of the quarter. When you transfer servicing, you have got to redo all the bill pay. And there is \u2013 that\u2019s just the result of not getting all those bill pays done off the quarter. By now, we are probably 90% of the way through that problem. It\u2019s just the timing issue.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O\u2019Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay. And then ex that impact, I assume the earlier stage delinquencies, what would the early stage delinquency look like?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I think 30-plus day in \u2013 mortgage was actually down $40 million, I think.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Absent that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Absent that issue.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O\u2019Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay, that makes sense. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">We will go next to Nancy Bush with NAB Research.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Good morning Nancy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Nancy Bush</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Good morning. Brian, could you just talk a little bit about your deposit market share, I mean you are sort of up the Street or around the corner from a company that showed us this morning that they are getting a lot of churn in their deposit base, so are you able to track whether you are benefiting from that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I wouldn\u2019t. I don\u2019t think we have specific guidance on that. Our market share \u2013 we are growing our deposits faster than market, therefore your market share is growing, where it\u2019s coming from exactly. Nancy, just for a historical perspective, because you have been around this company as this industry for a long time, I had them check something, but from 2007 to today, effectively the deposit per branch have doubled. And the checking account numbers are basically flattish and up maybe 1% or something like that, so think about the dynamics in terms of profitability. So we feel very good about the growth in deposits year-over-year, 12% in checking and 10% overall, so it\u2019s coming from somewhere, I just don\u2019t know where exactly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Nancy Bush</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Can you just give us an idea of where \u2013 are you gaining more market share through digital, mobile, are you gaining more through people still coming in the branch?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">The answer would be yes because\u2026</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Nancy Bush</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">All of the above?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yes. Let\u2019s think about it. I think Paul said earlier that mobile sales are 20-odd \u2013 20-ish percent, but that means 80% are not mobile therefore they are coming through other \u2013 call centers and branches, so it\u2019s an integrated business system. And Thong and Dean and the team have done a great job of optimizing that. If you look at the chart and watch the cost per deposit, deposit continues to work its way down while there is growth and additional salespeople. So it\u2019s coming. The year-over-year rise in mobile sales is actually faster, obviously, but it\u2019s still only 20% of the contribution.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">The other thing interesting, by the way, we are using a statistic I really like is we are using \u2013 we have digital appointments, so people come into the branch, but they don\u2019t just on walk in. Now, they are coming in for an appointment that they have made with over their smartphones. So that really helps us from an efficiency standpoint as well if we can get people to do that it\u2019s better for them, it\u2019s better for us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Nancy Bush</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay, yes. My follow-up question is this, I mean we have experienced or we experienced on November 8 sort of a sea change in the thinking about bank regulation going forward and everybody that I have talked to seems to think even if there are not significant changes in what\u2019s on the books, that there will be a \u201clighter touch\u201d in regulation and I guess I would ask if you are thinking in those terms and if so, do you think that, that will have an impact on your expense figure, expense numbers, number of people you need to add and compliance, etcetera, etcetera, sort of ongoing?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I think Nancy, if you think about it, there are a couple of dimensions obviously. That dimension is well spoken about out there. You saw yesterday, I think the House passed a couple cost benefit analysis type requirements for the SEC and the commodity things, so I think there will be a body of work that will go on to sort of balance, let\u2019s make sure we understand the pluses and minuses a lot of stuff. But the reality, if you think about our company, we have maintained \u2013 we invest a lot of talent and capabilities in people, in compliance and risk in \u201810, \u201811, \u201812 and it\u2019s then relatively flat, but the company has shrunk around it, so it\u2019s become a higher percentage, but it\u2019s not \u2013 we are able to now start to optimize that, make it better. And so I think if we get that, that\u2019s terrific, that will help us even do more potentially. But even if we don\u2019t, there is optimization to come now. We kind of crested all the different things have gone on in the industry. So first, it was the work of just collecting the bad mortgage and stuff, but now you are optimizing more the way we manage risk in a systems environment and stuff like that, so I look forward \u2013 that\u2019s what helps us to get confidence of the future path on costs overall.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Nancy Bush</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay, alright. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And we will take our last question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Good morning Gerard.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Hi Brian, how are you. I have got a question for Paul, you made a comment about that the end of the growth, end of the quarter, you saw some commercial activity, I know Brian referenced already some pickup in middle markets and commercial real estate, but can you give any further color of that commercial activity that you saw in the lending side at the end of the quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Yes, sure. That\u2019s \u2013 well, the earnings prep talk into ahead of our middle markets business, our DCB business and our small business banking. They are telling me that they are definitely seeing more interest from CEOs to have meetings. A lot of engagement around \u201817 and what the environment might be, things are feeling a lot more optimistic to those bankers. And it\u2019s not just talk. Late in the quarter, we actually did see an increase in loan balances that was a little \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t call it a spike, but there was definitely an acceleration late in the quarter in \u2013 particularly in middle market and to a lesser extent us in business banking.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Great. And another question actually Paul, obviously the banking industry has to live by a number of regulations that are dictated by the regulators on capital, liquidity, etcetera, coming back to that operational risk capital number you gave us for businesses that you have exited and no longer are operating in, is that an opinion that the Fed has just laid upon all the banks or is that actually in statutes where \u2013 to change it would require a lot of work versus if it\u2019s just the Fed wants to do that to make it extra conservative, maybe a new change in the Fed could maybe give you guys some relief there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Yes. So we have $500 billion of operational is RWA. I think our closest competitor has $400 billion. And then I think Citi is probably at $300 billion something. So we were given more by the regulators based upon the history of the bank, the acquisitions we did, the losses that were historical. But as you know, we have exited a lot of those products. We \u2013 Bank of America never had a risk profile. It was more the companies that we acquired, so it\u2019s a little bit arbitrary. There are models out there for calculating operational risk capital. Those models, there is lot of debate if you follow the Basel Committee process. So we are focused on trying to get that number down. But it\u2019s going to take a little while and we are going to need more clarity from the regulators on how they want to calculate a company\u2019s operational risk capital. But that\u2019s something that would be very helpful to us if new models were approved that were a little bit more rational in terms of looking at historical losses versus the current operations of a company.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">And then just finally. I think in your K, you put your DTA from last year, it might have been around $25 billion for the deferred tax asset, do you have an estimate yet for where it will stand at the end of \u201816?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Donofrio</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Yes, I do. The total DTA, guys keep me honest here, but I think it will be $19 billion. But let me give you the number that kind of matters probably is what you are \u2013 if you are thinking about the future. I mean we are not here sitting predicting any tax change, but what really matters if there is to U.S. tax change in the U.S. is, I will use 2015. In 2015, we had over $20 billion of U.S. profits, pretax profits, that\u2019s an important number. And then the other number that\u2019s important is, at year end, our DTAs that would be re-priced if the tax rate changed equaled approximately $7 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Thank you. Alright. So that was the last question. Let me close by closing up \u201816. We had 13% increase in net income for the year, 15% EPS. We had a good operating leverage, with 1% revenue growth and 5% expense growth. And we announced today that we increased our stock repurchase program another $1.8 billion. So that closes off a good year. As we look forward to 2017, we will just continue to do what we told you we are doing: focus responsible growth and we look forward to the benefits of a faster growing economy potentially and the increasing rates. So, thank you for your time and we forward to next time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">This will conclude today\u2019s program.

(Operator instructions) It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. Lee McEntire. Please go ahead sir.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Lee McEntire</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning, thanks everybody on the phone as well as the webcast for joining us this morning for our second quarter results. Before I turn the call over to Brian and Bruce, let me just remind you we may make some forward-looking statements today. For further information on those, please refer to either our earnings release documents, our website or the other SEC filings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">So with that I\u2019ll turn it over to Brian Moynihan our CEO for some opening comments before he goes to Bruce.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thanks, Lee, and good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. As you look at our results, you can see the storyline for this quarter is much the same as it was for last quarter. You can see that the revenue is showing stability in most of the core businesses. You can see the good core expense control, continued credit improvements, and solid business activity throughout the franchise.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">You can also see obviously the litigation expense from our legacy mortgage issues continued to affect our earnings this quarter. And you can also see we\u2019ve continued to build our strong balance sheet position and capital and liquidity. So in a minute, Bruce will take you through the details of the results.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">But I thought it would be good if we spend a couple of minutes at the outset here talking about what our customer and client data is telling us about the economy and what we see in our franchise.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">As we all know the economy is off to a little bit of a slow start this year, but growth has picked up recently. Most recent jobs data shows nearly 1.4 million are created in the first half of this year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">As we have strong positions, leadership positions across consumer and commercial companies in the Americas, we have a view into the key indicators of an improving economy which shows signs everywhere of improvement. Even in advance with the short-term interest rate is changing which would help our rich consumer \u2013 our deposit rich consumer and business banking segments, our consumer business had another good quarter. It performed well growing earnings 29% from last year included solid origination activities across the various products.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">In addition, as we look at our underlying consumers, they have increased their spending. We can see in our data that the retail volumes on debit and credit cards were up 4% from last year\u2019s second quarter but more importantly up 8% from the first quarter of this year showing increased momentum in spending among our card customers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Consumers are growing card balances also, they\u2019re borrowing a little bit more and they continue to add to their deposit balances. As you know, home sales continue to improve across the industry and we can see on our own results, as our originations and mortgages increased from first to second quarter, but importantly our purchase mortgage origination continue to grow. Our home equity originations also were up almost 30% for the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">When you look at the underlying transactional activity and volume activity in our stores, 7 to 8 million visitors come in each week showing continuous strong activity. We can also see that in our online activity where 30 million online customers continue to grow their overall volumes and importantly in our mobile activity where 15.5 million mobile customers continue to increase the use of technology including depositing 10% of all the checks, retail checks in our company through their mobile phones and other devices.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">The health of the consumer is also evident in our asset quality. Delinquencies continue to improve. Our consumer card loss rate ended the quarter at less than 3%. We see on the wealth management side, the consumer, the market\u2019s growth has added to consumer wealth. We have nearly $2.5 trillion in client balances in our global wealth and investment management business including a $100 billion in the brokerage assets for their retail and preferred customer base in our consumer business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We also see encouraging signs throughout our commercial customers. Commercial construction has improved and manufacturing activity in our clients has accelerated. The borrowing by our commercial customers remains healthy across the industry and credit quality is very strong.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Encouraging is that middle-market utilization rates are moving forward again this quarter ever so slightly. Industry sales and trading activity among our trading counterparties has been low as many of our peers have talked about in this low volatility environment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">However, our business \u2013 underlying business performed well. Tom Montag and his team had - our global markets business posted $1 billion - $1.1 billion in earnings for the quarter. Our investment banking pipeline remains strong and the back half of 2014 looks healthy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">While the economy still faces challenges, progress is being made throughout the economy but also throughout our company. We are seeing good business activity and a strengthening as we go through 2014. We are seeing improved financial health for our consumers, our customers and our corporate customers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">But the most important thing to think about is the signs of a gradually improving economy, is how our businesses is continually positioned to take advantage of the activity and deliver for you our shareholders.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">With that I\u2019ll turn it over to Bruce.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Great, thanks, Brian, and good morning everyone. Let\u2019s start on slide 2 and work through the second quarter results. We recorded earnings of $2.3 billion or $0.19 per diluted share this quarter which included pretax litigation expense of $4 billion which equated to roughly $0.22 a share after-tax. $3.8 billion of the litigation expense is associated with the build in reserves for previously disclosed legacy mortgage related matters which also included the AIG settlement that we announced this morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We are very pleased to have reached the definitive agreement with AIG which resolves all outstanding RMBS litigations between the parties for a settlement amount of $650 million. This agreement is important for two primary reasons.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">First, we have now resolved 95% of the unpaid balance of all RMBS as to which securities litigation has either been filed or threatened for all Bank of America related entities. It also includes AIG\u2019s agreement to withdraw as an objector to the Bank of New York Mellon private label securities settlement referred to as the Article 77 proceeding.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Revenues this quarter, on an FTE basis were $22 billion, relative to the second quarter of 2013 revenue was down $990 million driven by lower net interest income and mortgage banking income. Relative to the first quarter of 2014, it was approximately $800 million lower as higher investment banking fees, higher mortgage banking revenue was more than offset by seasonally lower sales and trading revenue, as well as lower equity investment income.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Total non-interest expense for the quarter was $18.5 billion, but included $4 billion of litigation expense. If we back out that litigation expense and compare it to Q2 2013\u2019s expenses, expenses improved by $1 billion or 6%, which was driven by lower LAS non-litigation expenses and to a lesser extent, our new BAC savings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">If we back out the $1 billion of retirement-eligible incentive comp from our first quarter results as well, you can see expenses declined roughly $700 million from the first quarter as a result of lower revenue-related compensation within our global markets business, lower LAS expenses ex litigation and to a lesser degree, our new BAC savings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Provision for credit losses was $411 million with net charge-offs of $1.1 billion and a reserve release of $662 million during the quarter. Our results from the quarter also benefited from the sale of $2.1 billion in non-performing residential loans.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">The income statement benefit from that sale was approximately $350 million of pre-tax or $0.02 a share after-tax and you saw roughly a $150 million of that benefit flows through other income and the balance through the recovery of net charge-offs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">And lastly, the aggregate amount of a few other items including debt securities gains, equity investment income, net DVA, as well as FAS 91 resulted in a benefit to EPS of approximately $0.04 a share.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">If we move to Slide 3 and look at our balance sheet highlights, you can see the balance sheet increased $21 billion from the first quarter of 2014. Our debt securities increased as a result of valuations and increases to highly liquid securities in our primary banking subsidiaries. Our Repo match book increased as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">If we look at ending loans, they were down $4.3 billion, primarily due to lower residential mortgages, principally within our discretionary portfolios and that also included the $2.1 billion bulk sale that I just mentioned.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">If we exclude residential mortgage loans, our consumer loans rose slightly as our US card balances grew $1.3 billion and our securities-based lending with our wealth management clients increased $1.8 billion. This was partially offset by pay-downs within our home equity book.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">If we move to the commercial side, commercial loans were up modestly as C&amp;I growth was mostly offset by a few sizable loan pay-downs, as well as a focus on overall relationship returns.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Period end deposits were over $1.1 trillion and reached record levels. Our tangible common equity ratio improved 14 basis points from the first quarter of 2014 to 7.14%. Tangible book value per share was $14.24, a 3% improvement from the first quarter and it was driven by both our earnings during the quarter, as well as a $2.3 billion increase in the value of our debt securities which you saw flow through OCI.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Lastly, to further enhance our Tier-1 capital structure, during the second quarter, we received shareholder approval and amended the Series T preferred shares, which increased our Tier-1 capital by $2.9 billion, and we issued $1.5 billion in preferred stock during the quarter at a favorable rate.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On Slide 4, we show our capital ratios under Basel 3. Under the transition rules, our CET1 capital was $153.6 billion, risk weighted assets $1.28 trillion, and that resulted in a ratio of 12%. If we look at our Basel 3 regulatory capital ratios on a fully phased-in basis, we saw very strong improvements in the first quarter of 2014. Our CET1 capital improved $7 billion driven by earnings, OCI improvement, as well as well as lower threshold deductions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">The numbers in the chart reflects risk weighted assets under the standardized approach with our CET1 ratio improving from 9% to 9.5%, well above our 8.5%, 2019 proposed minimum requirement. Under the advanced approach, our CET 1 ratio improved from 9.6% at the end of the first quarter of 2014 to 9.9%. That was driven by the improvement in our capital, partially offset by an increase in risk-weighted assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">If we turn to the supplementary leverage ratios, we estimate that at the end of the second quarter of 2014, we exceeded the updated US rules that are applicable beginning in 2018.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Our bank holding company exceeds the 5% minimum and our primary bank subsidiaries, BANA and FIA are both in excess of the 6% minimum.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">If we turn to Slide 5 on funding and liquidity, our long-term debt of $257 billion was up modestly during the quarter as our debt issuances were larger than maturities during the period. As we look forward at our debt issuance during the balance of the year, we\u2019ll continue to be opportunistic but we do expect our parent issuance to be below the $13 billion of contractual maturities in the second half of 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We\u2019ll also likely to continue to issue term debt out of our primary bank subsidiaries. Our second quarter 2014 long-term debt yields improved 12 basis points from the first quarter of 2014 2.29%. We realized significant improvements given only two years ago this yield was over 3% and our average debt balances were nearly $75 billion higher.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Our total global excess liquidity sources during the quarter increased to a record $431 billion as bank liquidity continue to grow in the second quarter and our time to required funding remained strong at 38 months.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">If we turn to Slide 6, our net interest income on a reported FTE basis was $10.2 billion, consistent with the first quarter of 2014 is a less negative impact from market-related adjustments was offset by an anticipated decline in the core net interest income. Negatively impacting our reported net interest income during the quarter were market-related adjustments of $175 million and that compares to $273 million negative in the first quarter of 2014, as you all know, long-term rates declined again during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Our net interest income, if we exclude the market-related adjustments declined as previously expected and communicated, due to seasonally lower average consumer loan balances and yields offset by an extra day of interest and all of that resulted in net interest income of $10.4 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As a result of the increased liquidity in the first half of the year, as well as lower loan balances and loan yields, the net interest yield excluding market-related adjustments declined 10 basis points to 2.26%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We continue to thoughtfully manage our OCI sensitivity and are very mindful of the liquidity and leverage rules as this quarter we invested more into shorter duration treasury securities. We continue to remain positioned to benefit if interest rates move higher, particularly from the shorter end of the curve.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">And as we head into the back half of 2014, we still expect modest improvement off of the second quarter of 2014 level of net interest income, which was $10.4 billion, excluding market-related adjustments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Non-interest expense on Slide 7 was $18.5 billion during the second quarter and once again included $4 billion of litigation expense. As we mentioned, $3.8 billion of the litigation expense relate to a build in reserves associated with previously disclosed legacy mortgage related matters including the AIG agreement. If we exclude litigation, total expenses were $14.6 billion this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">If we compare those to the first quarter of 2014 and exclude retirement eligible costs that we saw during the first quarter of 2014, our expenses declined $700 million on the lower incentives related to sales and trading revenue, reduced LAS non-litigation expense and to a lesser extent New BAC savings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Our legacy assets and servicing expenses during the quarter ex litigation were $1.4 billion and declined approximately $150 million from the first quarter of 2014. As we look forward with respect to our two expense programs, New BAC as well as our LAS expenses ex litigation, we have modified our expectations slightly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Our New BAC expense program is ahead of schedule and we now expect to reach a quarterly level of $2 billion in expense savings in the fourth quarter of 2014 as opposed to mid 2015. This means on an annualized basis, we will have fully achieved the $8 billion target that we announced in 2011. In the second quarter of 2014, our quarterly savings rate that was achieved on New BAC was $1.8 billion plus.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Moving to our LAS expenses ex litigation, we continue to make very good progress, but our compliance with applicable mortgage programs as well as governance guidelines may delay the expected timing of achieving our $1.1 billion goal by one quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">If we turn to asset quality on Slide 8, you can see credit quality once again improved on all fronts. Net charge-offs declined $315 million from the first quarter of 2014 to $1.1 billion or a 48 basis points net loss ratio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">As I mentioned earlier, this quarter did include a $2.1 billion sales of bulk non-performing loans, which included recoveries of $185 million on previously recorded net charge-offs. If we exclude the effect of the bulk sale net charge-offs, they\u2019ve declined a $130 million or 9% and the net loss ratio would have been at 56 basis points. These are decade level loans.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Delinquencies, a leading indicator of net charge-offs also showed improvement during the second quarter. Provision expense during the quarter was $411 and we released $662 million of reserves. We would expect net charge-offs going forward to continue to show modest improvement from the second quarter of 2014 levels of $1.3 billion, which excluded the recoveries that we received on the non-performing loan sales. We would also expect reserve releases to decline modestly through the balance of 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Let\u2019s walk through the business segment results now starting on Slide 9 with consumer and business banking. We continue to make solid progress on the strategy in this business through deepening relationships and reducing our costs by optimizing the delivery network. We are simplifying the product set as we reduce the number of offers, offerings and focus the smaller product sets on customer feedback and offer greater rewards to customers who bring us more of their relationships.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Some of the more significant operational activity during the quarter included the rollout of an advanced platform for mobile banking that had added functionality, rolling out the safe balance checking account, as well as an enhanced preferred rewards program that we launched after a successful pilot program. We are pleased with the results again this quarter as our earnings of $1.8 billion grew $29% from the second quarter of 2013 and were up 7% from the first quarter of 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">This business generated a 24% return on allocated capital during the quarter. Our revenue was relatively stable across the periods as lower net interest income was partially offset by higher service charges. Our expenses are down 4% from the second quarter of 2013 and lower operating, litigation and personnel costs. Our network delivery optimization benefit continued as we reduced another 72 banking centers through both sales as well as consolidations.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Our credit quality remains strong as net charge-offs decline versus both periods. Our U.S. credit card business exited the quarter with less than a 3% loss rate in June. Second quarter provision expense was $534 million, our net charge-offs improved $313 million from the second quarter of 2013 and $36 million from the first quarter of 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We released $120 million more in reserves this quarter than the second quarter of 2013 and $242 million more than the first quarter of 2014. From a customer activity perspective this quarter, we saw continued growth in our mobile banking customers which reached 15.5 million customers and our customer deposit transactions using mobile devices represented 10% of all transactions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Our average deposits of $544 billion are up organically almost $11 billion or 2% compared to the first quarter of 2014 and up 5% or nearly $25 billion compared to the second quarter of 2013 and we did that as our rates paid on our deposits reached a new low of 6 basis points.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Our brokerage assets surpassed $105 billion and are up 26% year-over-year based on both improved market valuations as well as customer flows. Our card issuance remained strong at 1.1 million new accounts in the second quarter of 2014 with approximately two-thirds of those cards going to existing customers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We saw growth in ending U.S. credit card balances this period with ending balances up $1.3 billion relative to the first quarter of 2014 and our risk-adjusted margin remains strong at approximately 9%. If you move to consumer real estate services, the loss in the quarter was driven by $3.8 billion of litigation expense.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Overall, we saw higher originations, improved mortgage banking revenues, and lower cost in both the fulfillment as well as the servicing sides of the business. Let\u2019s focus first on the reported sub-segments of home loans where we record the origination of consumer real estates.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Our home loans saw better leverage versus the first quarter of 2014 as both revenues and expenses improved. Our first mortgage retail origination were $11.1 billion and were up 25% from the first quarter of 2015 leading to higher core production revenues. As Brian mentioned, our mix of originations continued to shift to purchase as we are now at 47% purchased versus 17% in the year ago quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">At the end of the quarter, our origination pipeline was up 15% from the first quarter of 2014, but our applications per day are slowing a bit. Our home equity originations were $2.6 billion and increased 31% from the first quarter of 2014. We continued to reduce production staffing levels and the savings from several quarters of these reductions are beginning to show in our expense levels.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">If we move to the legacy assets and servicing sub-segment, the driver here was aforementioned litigation costs. From a cost of servicing perspective, our LAS expenses ex litigation did declined $141 million to $1.4 billion and our number of 60 plus day delinquent loans dropped 14,000 units to 263,000 units or down 5% from the end of the first quarter of 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">The primary revenue component in our LAS sub-segment servicing fees declined $40 million versus the first quarter as the size of our servicing portfolios declined. This was offset by a better net hedge performance on our MSRs. Also during the quarter, we did benefit from lower rep and warrant provisions which was $87 million or down nearly $100 million from the first quarter of 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">If we turn to Slide 11, global wealth and investment management, this business turned in another record revenue quarter, our pre-tax margins remained strong north of 25% for the sixth consecutive quarter. Our revenue of $4.6 billion was up 2% from the second quarter of 2013 and 1% over the first quarter of 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Record asset management fees offset the softness in transactional activity. Net income, $724 million was slightly lower than both comparative periods, driven by increased expenses. Our expense levels versus the second quarter of 2013 reflect higher revenue-related incentive comps, other volume-related costs, as well as continued investments in technology and other areas that support the growth that we are seeing within the business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Relative to the first quarter of 2014, expenses were driven by higher revenue-related costs, litigation-related expenses as well as marketing. Our return on allocated capital during the quarter was 24%. The momentum we are seeing in flows continued and was quite strong during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Client balances were up $72 billion from the end of the first quarter of 2014 to a record $2.5 trillion. Long-term AUM flows were nearly $12 billion for the quarter marking the fifth straight year of positive quarterly AUM flows. Our ending client loan balances were up $3.9 billion to a record $123 billion, which is up 3% from the first quarter of 2014 as we saw growth in both our securities-based lending as well as our residential mortgage lending.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">From a referral perspective, we continued to see coordinated efforts across wealth management and the banking groups as our referrals resulted in the funding of more than 250 institutional retirement plans worth more than 2.4 billion assets this quarter and that compares to a 156 wins in the year ago quarter of 600 million assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">If we turn to Slide 12, our global banking earnings for the quarter were $1.4 billion, up 4% from the second quarter of 2013 and up 9% over the first quarter of 2014. Our return on allocated capital was very strong at 18%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Compared to the second quarter of 2013, our revenue showed modest improvement while expenses increased and credit cost declined. Within the revenue category, our investment banking fees, company-wide this quarter were $1.6 billion, up 5% from the second quarter of 2013 and up 6% on a linked quarter basis. We maintained a solid leadership position in investment banking fees and we had particularly strong equity underwriting results during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Our provision was $132 million during the quarter and included a $156 million reserve build. Our provision costs were favorable to both comparative periods as we added less reserves in the first quarter of 2014 and had less charge-offs compared to the second quarter of 2013.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Expenses increased $50 million versus the second quarter of 2013 on higher litigation, but improved $129 million from the first quarter of 2014 on lower personnel and back-office support costs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">If we look at the balance sheet, average loans were $271 billion during the quarter, up 6% compared to the second quarter of 2013, but flattish compared to the first quarter of 2014. Our loan balances relative to the first quarter of 2014 bear \u2013 I think several comments, but I\u2019d like to make the first is, we saw sizable pay-downs during the quarter as our customers accessed the capital markets. We had approximately $2 billion of such pay-downs where our customers chose access to markets and refinanced existing bank loans.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Within commercial real estate, we continued to optimize the mix with several small portfolio sales that took those balances down, little over $2 billion. We are being sensitive with respect to pricing of commercial loans as we are not going to chase loans at the expense of overall client relationship profitability goals.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And lastly within the global banking segment, deposit flows remained solid and were stronger at the end of the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">If we move to global markets on Slide 13, we earned $1.1 billion in the second quarter of 2014, that\u2019s up 14% from the year ago period and down seasonally 16% from the seasonally strong period of the first quarter. Net DVAs during the quarter was a gain of $69 million versus gains of $49 million in the second quarter of 2013 and a $112 million in the first quarter of 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Despite the slowdown in FICC across the industry group, we were pleased with the results this quarter. Our revenue was up 9% from the second quarter of 2013, but down 9% from the seasonally high first quarter of 2014. Our second quarter of 2014 revenue did include an equity gain of roughly $240 million on the modernization of an equity investment. That is not reflected as part of our sales and trading revenues. Our sales and trading revenue net of DVA was $3.4 billion which was 1% lower than the second quarter of 2013 and 17% lower than the first quarter of 2014. Our FICC sales and trading revenue during the quarter increased 5% compared to the second quarter of 2013 and was down 20% from the seasonally higher first quarter of 2014 levels.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Driving the year-over-year improvement within fixed were results in our mortgage business, our munis business, as trading conditions and our performance improved in both areas. Those improvements were partially offset by weaker financial performance in foreign exchange as well as commodities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">On the equity sales and trading side, we were down 14% from the second quarter of 2013 and 11% from the first quarter of 2014 as lower market volatility depressed overall secondary market client activity. Expenses were up from the second quarter of 2013 on higher technology and staff support investments and to a lesser degree incentives, but down from the first quarter of 2014 in line with the seasonal revenue decline that we saw.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Trading-related assets on average increased $23 billion to $460 billion during the quarter and our return on allocated capital was 13% during the second quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">On Slide 14, we show all other; revenue was down $463 million from the first quarter of 2014 and lower equity investment gains of $618 million which were partially offset by lower negative market-related adjustments to net interest income during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Our second quarter 2014 expense and all other is down $1.3 billion from the first quarter as it included retirement eligible incentive costs and some litigation expense. The second quarter of 2014 provision benefit of $246 million was $111 better than the first quarter of 2014 and $67 million better than the second quarter of 2013.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Net charge-offs of $11 million improved $195 million from the first quarter of 2014 driven by the recoveries that I had mentioned associated with our bulk NPL sales.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">During the quarter, our effective tax rate was relatively low, primarily as a result of the impact of tax preference items on a lower earnings base. For the back half of 2014, we would expect to see an effective tax rate of approximately 31% ex any unusual items.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I am going to wrap up before we take questions with a couple closing comments. We feel like we made very strong progress during the quarter. We saw good business activity across the customer base. We experienced year-over-year revenue growth in our global banking, global markets and global wealth management businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Our consumer business profitability grew 29% from last year and in the mortgage business we are taking cost out of the fulfillment side as well as the cost to service our delinquent loans. We reported $0.19 of earnings and absorbed cost allowing us to resolve all outstanding RMBS issues with AIG and build substantial reserves for our remaining legacy mortgage issues.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">We did this while adding to our already strong Basel 3 capital ratios and improving our liquidity measures to record levels and our asset quality improved to decade low loss ratios. And with that, we\u2019ll go ahead and open it up for questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p8\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">(Operator Instructions) And we\u2019ll take our first quarter from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hey, thanks. Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hey, a couple questions. One, you had some callouts on some nice gains and I know a couple of other banks reporting here this cycle have done the same thing. I\u2019m wondering how much more in your pipeline do you think you have to extract some value from the mortgage-related portfolio here that you're in the process of selling down (inaudible)?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">We took, Betsy, a piece of our non-performing loans out and as non-performing loans and as you know, when you receive it, to the extent that you receive income you write down the basis for those loans and we took those loans out and saw healthy gains. We continue to look at the sale of non-performing loans, but I would not expect anything near the magnitude from the sale of non-performing loans that we saw this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay, separately, on just litigation related stuff you highlighted the AIG agreement that \u2013 it looks like a great win for you guys. I guess the question is does them pulling out as a dissenter do anything to speed up the timing on that Article 77 case?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I think the \u2013 the timing is going to progress on the schedule that it otherwise would have \u2013 I think you all know that from an objector perspective that they were probably the strongest and most vocal objector with respect to the case and we\u2019ll just have to see as we move forward what the impacts from them dropping their objection to the cases.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I think the other thing that\u2019s important is as it relates to holding of the securities or at least a basis to object, but they were the largest holder that was out there from holding securities as part of the settlement. I think they noted that in the release this morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yep, thanks. Okay and then just lastly, it\u2019s been a lot of debate recently about how the Fed could potentially start to exit. Obviously in the [inaudible] they talked about that, and it sounds there were calls recently about how people are thinking about rate betas.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I know from the Q you have a relatively positive outlook for what rising rate does to your earnings stream. Could you just remind us what percentage of your deposits are consumer and how you are thinking about rate betas in a rate rise environment relative to asset betas?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Sure, couple of things, if you look at asset sensitivity, you\u2019ll see that the exposure to a 100 basis point parallel shift in rate, that the benefit increased this quarter from about $3.2 billion in the first quarter to $3.4 billion. As you look at the deposit base, a couple of things of note, the first is, north of 70% of the overall deposits that we have throughout the company are within our consumer and wealth management business and as it relates to \u2013 I would say overall asset betas that through history given the branch network and the relationships those tend to be very stable.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I think you get a sense for that as you look at the continued deposit growth that we\u2019ve seen while at the same time taking rates paid down pretty significantly. If you move to the institutional side, and look at where we are, roughly 75% of the deposits that we have within the institutional business are domiciled here in the U.S. and the predominant mix of that is with our core corporate and commercial customers and if you look at the reason that they are holding those deposits with us is because we tend to be their core relationship bank.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">We do their cash management, we do their treasury service revenue and have relationships that are beyond just a place for them to put their deposits. So, as we move forward, there is obviously a level of uncertainty to the extent of a Fed withdrawal, but as we look at the overall deposit base, the stability of it and our outlook going forward, we feel like that we\u2019re very well positioned.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I would add on the consumer side also as you look at year-over-year dynamics in terms of deposit growth of $25 billion, also look at this, we are still running off a CD portfolios that was more of a funding portfolios for some of the companies that we acquired.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So that I think there is a round number of $10 billion reduction in CDs over that time period and we\u2019ve also obviously sold some deposits not a huge amount. So that growth is over top of all that and net.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So, we feel good about the consumer franchise ability to continue to grow deposits even while being very disciplined on price and as rates rise, that value will be recognized and we expect those deposits now are much more core, you have the checking account deposit year-over-year I think were up to 25% to 30% in terms of average balance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. Thanks a lot.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And we\u2019ll go next to Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Jim Mitchell \u2013 Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yes, hey, good morning. I just wanted to follow-up quickly up on that deposit question. I noticed that non-interest bearing was up 11%; interest-bearing up only 1%. So that speaks to your efforts. Do you think there is more to go there or should we start to see deposit growth more in line with your peers at this point?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I think if you look at the - just on the consumer business, the year-over-year growth was $25 billion and the linked quarter growth was $10 billion so obviously we are growing at a faster rate in the current environment, at the spots so to speak Jim than we have been year-over-year. And so the growth rate of 2% was nominal in a quarter which would be annualized 8% about high 5% to 6% year-over-year. So, it\u2019s accelerating still by the good core activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Jim Mitchell \u2013 Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Right, okay, great, and then on loan growth, you still have \u2013 as you mentioned, a couple of asset sales, still some legacy asset run-offs. When do we start to see the inflection point in your view and maybe if you can give us a sense of underlying demand that you are seeing in your customer group?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Sure, let\u2019s go \u2013 it\u2019s a very good question Jim and I think we need to break out and discuss \u2013 if you look at the declines that we saw in the residential mortgage area, that those are largely due to whole loan repayments of loans that are held within our investment portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And so if you look at the consumer business, I think there are couple of key things that I would note. The first is, on a linked quarter basis, this is the first quarter in some time where we actually saw ending card balances within our domestic card balance increase and those were up as we mentioned roughly $1.3 billion from the first quarter to the second quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So we saw growth there and then if you move to what we saw within the wealth management area as I mentioned, we saw very strong growth both in securities based lending as well as within mortgage origination there. Once again on the home equity front, the progress that we are making on the origination front where we saw about $2.6 billion is really being masked by the run-off and the amortization of the home equity book that we have that runs off to the extent of $3 billion to $4 billion a quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So, within the consumer businesses, if you look at kind of the core front-end, we are seeing some consumer loan growth that just gets masked by the run-off of some of the consumer real estate. On the overall commercial and corporate side, I did referenced the couple pay-offs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">As we look at one of the benchmarks that we look at is the revolver draws that we have within our commercial banking business, that number which had gotten as low as in the low 30s was up almost 100 basis points this quarter, and it\u2019s now in the high 30s.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So we are starting to see some greater activity on the revolver space within our commercial banking customers and overall activity with the corporate customers continues to be good but we are seeing \u2013 as I reference customers taking advantage of favorable debt capital markets which we obviously benefit from a debt underwriting perspective.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Jim Mitchell \u2013 Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Right, that's fair. Just one last question on the LCR, did you \u2013 maybe I missed it, did you disclose where you are on that front?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We did not, at the parent at this point, we are above 100% at the parent, so we are good from a 2017 compliance there. If we look at the combined BANA and FIA LCR ratios, those two companies or two banks will be put together October 1, that LCR numbers in the high 80s at this point and we\u2019ll continue to build the LCR ratio at the banks to be at least a year ahead of where we need to be.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Jim Mitchell \u2013 Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Will that put any further pressure on NIM if you are building more liquidity there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">It should not, there \u2013 as we look at, there has been a significant build at this point and as we look at the funding and the balance of that between both core consumer deposit growth as well as where we are that should not have an effect. If you look at the build that we talked about in the first quarter and second quarter, at this point I would say we\u2019ve eaten that expense and we now need to get after it and optimize to get the expense knocked back down.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Jim Mitchell \u2013 Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay, great. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And we\u2019ll go next to Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Matt O'Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Hi, good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Good morning Matt.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Matt O'Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">On expenses, it seems like most of the New BAC savings are in the run rate here, yet we still read about \u2013 some various expense initiatives that you have underway in terms of branch rationalization and simplification and things like that. So, just wondering is there another New BAC or just ongoing efforts to bring down costs and how meaningful those might be?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I think in the near-term Matt, the number one thing about cost is continue to work down the LAS legacy costs down to a more normalized level on a per loan basis and also keep producing the number of delinquent loans. So, that\u2019s the real expense leverage and what Bruce talked about earlier is we get to make sure we do it the right way especially in connection with sort of finishing up some of the regulatory work there. That\u2019s the real large dollar amount.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">You are pointing out exactly that situation on the core, you run at about $13 billion a quarter on core expenses, not a bad number if you annualize it and sort of think that through but the real question is how do you hold it there and keep investing in the businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And so when we started the New BAC, we never gave a target that said, we are going to save of this money but we are going to reinvest that we gave you a sort of net target and now we are reaching that. And so, what we would challenge our teams too is how to maintain a good operating leverage going forward and so we are more about simplifying the company and continuing to take out expenses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">But a lot of that will offset the 1000 people we\u2019ve added in the branches that we sell more products if you are seeing the benefit of the continued adds we make in the wealth management business and training programs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">We hired a 30% or 40% more people out of schools this year because we got to keep replenishing our talent base, commercial bankers et cetera. So, as you look forward, the inflationary type things that go on, merit raises and healthcare expenses and stuff like that and investing in the business including the $3 billion plus we put in technology developments every year will need to be offset by hard expense work and so that\u2019s the plan we have and we are putting this, we keep driving those plans in place. So there will be less bottom-line reduction on the core expense base and more how you hold it there in a relatively slow growth environment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Matt O'Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay, so just to try and summarize, even if there is some modest revenue growth, you would hope to keep that $13 billion relatively stable on a net basis, then?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes, if we want accept them, when markets kicks up you are going to have more comp related to that or wealth management comp which is good. So, you got to be careful, because those things kind of come and go and you can see that just the last couple of quarters. But, if you think what David Darnell and the team have done in the retail business, they are still rationalizing the branch structure which will offset putting more people in the branches that are more personal bankers and FSAs. And they\u2019ve done a pretty good job at offsetting that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">In addition we are repatriating some jobs to help on the consumer credit \u2013 customer delight scores and stuffs from places that legacy enterprises had in other places and bringing them in and that rationalization is going on and that\u2019s adding to our job count in the near term but we\u2019ll rationalize back out.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Matt O'Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. And then on the LAS cost, obviously making good progress there and I am not sure there is too much concern if it gets pushed out one quarter. But is there still the goal of getting down to $500 million or below $500 million per quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes, and that\u2019s going to trail and move with this. We drive down the 60 plus day delinquent loans, but clearly the $1.1 billion that we\u2019ll either have in the fourth quarter or the first quarter of next year is still way too high given the number of 60 plus day delinquent loans that we have as well as the size of the servicing portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Matt O'Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay, and then just lastly if I can squeeze in on the CCAR capital resubmission process, just remind us when you expect to get an update on that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Sure. We submitted our materials to the Fed on May 27. They have up to 75 days to respond. I believe the 75th day is August 10 and we continue to see where they come up.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Matt O'Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And we\u2019ll go to next to Glenn Schorr with ISI. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI Group</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Thank you. Quick question on the match book was up or at least the Fed funds sold and repurchased on the asset side was up 6.5% quarter-on-quarter. It's the opposite of what we're seeing at a lot of banks and trends in the market. So I am just curious is there an opportunity to get closer to clients? Is this a function of the fact that your SLR is in great shape so why not use it when you can? Just curious on what is underlying that trend?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes, I would think, Glenn, probably more than anything if you go back and look at both the notional size of the balance sheet as well as the match book, we were probably a little bit lower at the end of 2014 - the end of the first quarter of 2014 than you would normally see. So, that number will bounce around, but I wouldn\u2019t read anything into the fact that it was up because it was much lower at both the end of 2013 as well as the first quarter of 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI Group</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Anything different on the client usage front? It is bucking a trend though I hear your comments on the year-end. It's just with the changes in SLR, it's changing pricing theoretically, I just don't know if it's more theoretical than actual.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I think the pricing is probably more theoretical because if you look across the industry we continue to see both the banks in Europe as well as the banks in Asia provide at so, I am not sure you\u2019re seeing any meaningful movement in what you are able to charge from a match book perspective.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI Group</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I get that, yes thanks. Okay, switching gears, in wealth management, obviously everything is doing pretty darn good in wealth management. But I\u2019ll pick a little bit and I\u2019ll just ask, expense \u2013 negative operating leverage in a quarter when the markets are doing well, meaning revenues were up or expenses are up more.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I heard and saw your comments on the additional investments in technology. Is it comp or is it that additional investment technology? In other words, when markets are growing and flows are great you would expect margins to hold their ground, not give it up. Maybe a little more color on what investments to help that business grow would be helpful?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Sure, well you\u2019ve got a couple things, the first is that as you look at the expense growth during the quarter, and you look at the buckets roughly, half of it relates to incentive related comp that is a result of increased revenues. We do have a couple of initiatives that you\u2019d expect to roll off over the next couple quarters within the wealth management business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">We obviously have the rollout of Merrill One over the last couple of quarters where you saw some expense there. There we spent some additional money spend as we invest in system related to retirement systems and retirement programs as we continue to see growth there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And so, you do have some of that activity as well as just making sure that the right investment within the various control support functions are appropriate. So \u2013 at the same time, as we look forward, you need to see positive operating leverage not negative operating leverage and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll look to work for as we go through the next couple quarters of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">You point out, I mean, it\u2019s an obvious point and we \u2013 the team is focused on it, but we have made some near term investments including training programs and hiring people into the business working to the branches and stuff to help, but it something that we got to monitor closely and we think it will come back down and more in line with what you would expect.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI Group</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Great, I appreciate that. Last one is, slide 20 shows that the private-label outstanding claims keep going up every quarter. Anything new there? I am not sure what's driving that and if \u2013 I know that we have most of this stuff accounts for in the settlements, but just curious?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I think that the notable think that I would call out is that when we get private-label claims that comp, there are two different types of claims that come in, there is the first that our claims where people have had the ability to look at loan files and submit a claim based on a loan file, not being what they\u2019ve thought it be and the second is that, you can have people that at points in time do what we call or throw in what we would characterize as a bulk claim where they are just throwing it in without having done any work whatsoever on the loan file.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And what\u2019s important when you look at what we saw during the second quarter of 2014 we saw roughly $1.9 billion of original unpaid balance on the loans not loss, gross of that amount, the amount of bulk claims were no file reviews and went down was $1.9 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So, I would not read too much into that number because it\u2019s not for loan files where there has been any work done and I would just say generally if you look at what we\u2019ve seen regarding some of the recent decisions where there seems to be some stickiness at this point on different statutes of limitations as well as a recent ruling that came out of California with respect to RMBS litigation that we do feel like we are moving forward and getting AIG behind us is significant in regards to putting the rest of this behind us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Sure,</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI Group</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. I appreciate it. That's it for me. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And we\u2019ll go next to Jon McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Jonathan McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Hi, good morning. Bruce, the increase in Tier-1 common of $7 billion was impressive relative to the net income in the quarter. Any more color on the drivers there? You mentioned AOCI. What were the threshold deductions that helped drive the capital expansion so much more than that income?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Sure, so, as we\u2019ve said, given where we are from a disallowed DTA position that we\u2019re at a point where broadly speaking, we accrete capital on a pre-tax as opposed to an after-tax basis and so, as you look at the results we had roughly $3 billion of pre-tax income.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">We had roughly $3.5 billion of pre-tax OCIs that gets you to above $6.5 billion and then as you look at threshold deductions of roughly 10%, take 10% of that $6.5 billion, it gets you roughly $700 million, that gets you to roughly $7.2 billion of capital build, you back out the common dividend of 100 and that gets you to your $7.1 billion build.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Jonathan McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay and that building at a pre-tax due to the DTA, that\u2019s something that should continue on a steady pace, right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Clearly, at least over the next \u2013 I would say, probably two to four quarters it will be a function of the exact earnings but, for the near term that\u2019s correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Jonathan McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay and can you give us the numbers on what the excluded DTA is today and what it changed in during the quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I believe that the excluded DTA was roughly $15 billion and it was down over \u2013 little over $1 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Jonathan McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. On RWA, are there risks that the continued legal settlements would drive up your operational risk metrics or is there a forward-looking component to the op risk calc that already anticipates more settlements coming?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yes, we are mindful of the fact of settlements, there is obviously a lot of discussion and dialogues around op risk RWA. If you look at and when we noted that the reason risk-weighted assets went up during the quarter under the advanced approach, it was we are doing exactly what you referenced was reflecting an increased amount of operational risk RWA. We don\u2019t give the exact number, but you should assume that that amount is in the 26% to 27% of our total risk-weighted assets number and is in line with our largest peer.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Jonathan McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. On capital, on the last CCAR your binding constraint was the leverage ratio more than the risk-based Tier 1 minimum. I assume the recent preferred issuance and the Buffett conversions will help close that gap and position you better for next year's CCAR minimum. Could you comment on that? Or are there more things you can do to close the gap and have a quantitative cushion that's bigger to that leverage ratio next year as well?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Well, the first John, is jut to manage the notional size of the balance sheet which we continue to do. The second thing that I would note is, when you look at the sale of the re-performing loans that we did, those are the types of assets that in the CCAR at least we believe we don\u2019t have access to the federal reserves\u2019 models, but those are types of assets that tend to get hard.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So, we continue to look hard and look to drive down the non-performing consumer real estate piece of what we have and this quarter was a good example of it. And then, you are exactly right, with respect to the leverage ratio that there is a benefit that that preferred stock gives with north of $4 billion this quarter that we generated will continue to look to see if more preferred makes sense and then lastly, we\u2019ll continue to look at and see if sub that makes sense from a total capital perspective as well. The incremental cost of those is very low and we just want to make sure the balance sheet is optimized for those different buckets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Jonathan McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay, thanks and on sales and trading, just in terms of the dynamics of the quarter, did you see a pickup in June as the other banks did? And any sense of what drove that? Have you seen any follow-through on that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yes, our activity levels and \u2013 if you saw a P&amp;L throughout the quarter, while June was marginally better, I would characterize the activity that we saw within the sales and trading business during the second quarter to be fairly consistent. And if we look out at the third quarter, typically with the summer the third quarter is a little bit seasonally slower than the second quarter. If you look at our results last year, you\u2019ll see that and as we come into the third quarter, there is nothing unusual in our third quarter numbers of last year and how we compare to those numbers is going to be a function of how well we perform this quarter and that\u2019s obviously up to us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">John, if you look at page 19, you can see the second quarter, second quarter, second quarter, across the last three years and it\u2019s remarkably stable in terms of markets revenue lower part of that page. And so, Tom and the team did a \u2013 a few years ago we actually reduced the headcount almost 5000 people and that\u2019s allowed us to make $1 billion in this current environment as we did this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So, this ebb and flow as you and I\u2019ve talked about in various occasions, it is a core part of what we do. But we show you the separate P&amp;L, we show that from the first quarter half a good quarter, this quarter had a $1 billion bucks and it may come down as activity moves around the clients but it\u2019s a relatively stable revenue base that we can make money on because of the expense adjustments we made last year \u2013 in the last couple of years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Jonathan McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay and last thing for me, Bruce, on the CRES page, in terms of mortgage servicing revenues, is this quarter's core mortgage servicing revenue a stable base as you see it? Or is there further shrinkage in the size of the servicing book from sales that are ongoing that would impact the servicing fee?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yes, there we\u2019ve got one more sales that we\u2019ll look to wrap up this quarter that\u2019s got fairly high consent of 60 plus day delinquent loans. But beyond that, that one transfer this quarter were largely at the end of servicing sales and we are at a base of what you see should be what we have going forward with the plusses and minuses being what runs off versus what we put on.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Jonathan McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. You're still taking rep and warranty provisions. What are those for? Is that for current originations, or is it still catch-up from past stuff?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">As you look at I think, rep and warrant was less than $100 million this quarter. You are going to always have that as you go forward, but we are not seeing much rep and warrant at all on recent originations that\u2019s going to be more legacy related.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Jonathan McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thank you, John.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And we\u2019ll go next to Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thanks, good morning. First question I had was just a follow-up on CRES. Is there any sort of immediate benefit in terms of the ability to accelerate LAS legacy servicing cost reductions now because of the bulk sale?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">From a number of units perspective, as you look at the bulk sales over the \u2013 there is a piece of it that was \u2013 that we service and the results of a piece that others service. So in the context of the number of 60 plus day delinquent loans it was not meaningful relative to the total.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Got it. So what we're really looking at is more what you were talking about in response to John's question a minute ago, which is the potential for one more sale this quarter and then just normal run-off.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">That\u2019s correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Got it. Question for you while we're on the topic of mortgage stuff. Obviously you had the $4 billion litigation reserve build essentially this quarter. It appears, based on what you gave as an after-tax impact that you take a full tax benefit against that. Of course, what we find with a lot of these things, especially with like the DOJ settlements is that a large amount is not deductible. Do you have any flexibility with respect to being able to use a lower tax rate?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">A couple things, we don\u2019t give the exact numbers, but if you go back and look at the first quarter, we look at and try to understand what the tax treatment is for the different settlement. There was a piece of it in the first quarter that we would have assumed was not tax deductible and you are right, the piece that \u2013 and the reserves that we took this quarter there was a presumption that it was tax deductible.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And the short answer is, until you get to the end, you don\u2019t know the exact mix. But we try to be thoughtful with that and I would just say as it relates to the total number, as we said last quarter, there was $2.4 billion of litigation expense over and above what was for settlement. In this quarter you got in the high threes and I think it gives you a sense as to the magnitude of the reserves that are built over the last two quarters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Got it. Switching topics, you did talk about pricing on commercial loans in the context of not seeing a meaningful increase in commercial loan balances this quarter, and I guess alluded to some discipline that you're exercising. Can you talk a little bit about the conditions that you're seeing in the commercial loan market and where you think there is froth?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Sure, if you look at an embedded under the global banking segment, we\u2019ve got the loans that are done within our corporate investment bank that tend to be for the larger companies and as we look at spreads and yields on a linked quarter basis, within our business, we saw relative stability in the yields in those businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And, as we look out at in the marketplace given that those loans that are brought for those customers tend to be broadly syndicated and there tends to be a relationship in the yield between that and where they can access capital in the capital market, that low in pricing over the last quarter has hung in there and like I said it was generally flat, Q1 to Q2.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I would say, we tend to see a little bit more of a competitive pressure tends to be within the base commercial bank which is for middle-market companies where that they tend to be more one, two, or three bank deals and we have seen that area continues to be pretty competitive and we are just being disciplined with how we approach that market and given the footprint that we have, we do have the flexibility to not chase things within some of these regional markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And just to follow-up on that, when you say banks competing for that business, are you using the word bank in a traditional sense or are you actually seeing a lot of the competition for those type of mid-market loans coming from outside of what we would think of as the traditional banking sector?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">No, I would \u2013 for the core commercial customer, that\u2019s going to be the traditional banking customer as you think of it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay and then just a housekeeping question, just to make sure I understand what you were saying. You said there were \u2013 maybe $250 million of gains in Global Markets, I guess, probably \u2013 not to put words in your mouth, but things like market. And you \u2013 but I think you said that you did not include those numbers in the core equities or fixed income segment revenues. Is that right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Yes, but that\u2019s correct so we had a position that went public during the quarter. There was a gain and it\u2019s reflected in the revenues of the global market segment. But we did not think that was appropriate to include that in the core FICC and equity sales and trading. So if you go to the table on page 13, when you look at that FICC and equity sales and trading number ex DVA that that does not include any benefit from the gain that we saw within the overall segment during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Got it, perfect. Thanks for the clarification.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Sure.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And we\u2019ll go next to Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Great, thanks. I was wondering; you've got a little less than $250 billion of residential real estate loans and $90 billion of home equity. How much do you think those decline before those stabilize, because I think you tried to talk about in terms of the overall loan growth. But that's really \u2013 those are really the categories that are shrinking. I mean, do you have a sense as to where those categories will level out?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Well, if you start from a home equity perspective, I think that the repayment and run off of those is a god thing and not a bad thing. And so, you\u2019ll continue to see \u2013 I would expect over the next couple of years that the amortization of those is going to be greater than the new loans coming on the book. We would not expect though as you look at net interest income given the yields on those versus what you can do with other things that the run off of that book will have a negative impact from an overall net interest income perspective.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And as it relates to the whole loans piece, that we have, I would expect that that over time that will continue to run down. We continue to look as we talked about before on the home loans business to put and to originate mortgages for customers where we want to hold those loans during the quarter, we put about $6 billion of home loans that were originated for our customers on our balance sheet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Roughly 75% to 80% of those would have been of the jumbo variety. But I think to be realistic over the next probably couple of years, you are likely to see a little bit more run-off of that then you\u2019ll see new loans coming on and we obviously have the decision at that point of do you want to reinvest those proceeds and other whole loans that you can buy out in the market or invest those in securities and I would say at this point with LCR as well as what we are focused on from a customer perspective, they are much more likely to be invested in securities than new whole loans that are not for our customers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Got it and secondly, the reserve build for legal, I guess, could you talk about how much you have in reserves in total? Or maybe address as to how you came up with that number? Given the fact that I think, if I'm reading the footnotes correctly, that your possible but not accrued losses kind of have stayed flat from the first quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yes, couple things, the range of possible loss that you quoted of being flat from the first quarter to the second quarter relates to our representation and warranty reserves not our litigation RTL. So, you are correct that the rep and warrant piece was flat quarter-over-quarter. We do not update and provide a range of possible loss on litigation expense until we file the 10-Q.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">As it relates to overall litigation reserves, we do not put out an exact or a level of our litigation reserve, what I do think is notable and probably most relevant is the information that I gave you as it relates to the litigation reserve that\u2019s been built over the last two quarters that relates to legacy mortgage related matters and I think you can see and people are aware of what the most significance of those matters are.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And obviously each quarter as it relates to the reserving, we go through each quarter and assess where we are and what we think is appropriate from a reserving perspective and we did that again in this quarter just like we do in any quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay, great and just a quick follow-up to the first one. You had mentioned kind of investing some of the run-off from the mortgages and home equity portfolio in securities. Is that in the context of keeping those balances kind of stable or would you actually increase that portfolio?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yes, the first goal is obviously, as we\u2019ve talked about it to find and invest in loans that are for our core customers across the platform and that\u2019s priority one to the extent that there is residual or excess which there has been given the deposit growth that we\u2019ve seen the money does gets invested and it\u2019s been invested primarily in the most recent several quarters in securities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I mentioned OCI risk, the notable thing is that if you look at the OCI risk that we have as a company, even though the securities book has increased significantly over the course of the last twelve months, the overall level of OCI risk based on the different metrics that we look at is not changed and that\u2019s the result of us shortening the portfolio investing in shorter duration treasury securities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay, thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And we\u2019ll go next to Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Steven Chubak \u2013 Nomura Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Hi, good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Steven Chubak \u2013 Nomura Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">So the first question I have pertains to capital and RWA specifically. So over the last five quarters, we have actually seen the RWAs on a flat to upward trajectory; and then effectively the growth has mirrored the balance sheet growth that we've seen over that same period.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And I just wanted to get a sense as to whether there were any additional mitigation levers that you guys could potentially pull, or whether those types of opportunities have been largely exhausted, and thus the growth going forward will likely continue to mirror the balance sheet?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yes, I think as it relates to the risk-weighted assets they can either bifurcate risk-weighted assets under Basel 3 standardized versus those under Basel 3 advance. As you look at the Basel 3 standardized ratios, the benefits that we have there tend to come from the roll-offs of the different consumer loan portfolios both in first mortgage as well as in home equity and we would expect as we talked about throughout the call that you will continue to see a run-off there and given that a lot of the stuff that\u2019s running off is higher loan to value than the new stuff that\u2019s coming on that there is incremental benefit there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">So, if you look at over the last five quarters, I think the way that the standardized metric is set up, the standardized metric is going to tend to mere the overall loan growth that you have and I am just \u2013 as I mentioned going forward, on average it will probably be a little bit lower mix coming on than what rolls off.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">On the advanced approach at this point, as we look forward, there will continue to be opportunities and stuff that\u2019s advanced that tends to be heavier risk-weighted that rolls off between now and 2017, it\u2019s not going to be anywhere near material as what we\u2019ve seen and under the advanced approach, the recent increase as you\u2019ve seen has largely been attributable to operational risk as opposed to what we are seeing within the kind of the core loan categories.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Steven Chubak \u2013 Nomura Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay, thanks. Now, that's really helpful. And switching over to GWIM for a moment and actually taking a longer-term view on the earnings power within the segment, there is one area where we have struggled from a modeling perspective. It's trying to contemplate exactly how high the operating margin can get in a rising rate scenario, because the operating leverage improvement can be fairly dramatic.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">But presumably there is that peak margin level where competition is going to intensify to such a degree that effectively there's going to be no more room for improvement beyond, I don't know, let's call it 30%. I didn't know if that was something which you guys had evaluated at least in the context of a rising rate scenario.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I think, you\u2019ve got one of the levers in the business that people often overlook is the lever towards rising rates, because in the business itself the amount of total deposits and loans are significant $250 of deposits and loans. And I think we said on the last call, and as said many times, we can see this margin moving towards 30% and that dynamic yield in that environment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">But I think when you get to there, you start to top out a little bit if you just understand the broad base of revenue and the amount that goes through the grid and things like that that become a govern on what you can do beyond that. But as the mix of our business of wealth management with the private banking business and loans and deposits from a general client base and what\u2019s been there, that gets leveraged in the upside as you described.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Steven Chubak \u2013 Nomura Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay, great and one final one on credit. At your Analyst Day a number of years ago, you had given some guidance on through the cycle charge-off rates. But clearly since that update your loan mix has changed fairly dramatically and at the same time underwriting standards have tightened meaningfully.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">From what I recall, I believe the through-the-cycle charge-off rate at that time that was implied was somewhere in the neighborhood of 120 bps. And clearly it's going to be lower than that going forward, but I was hoping you could give us an update, maybe some updated guidance on where you think that through this cycle and net charge-off rate will likely end up?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I think, if you look at the charge-offs, the key is that when you really think about the broad constitution of $1.3 if you remove the recoveries, you got to look at the card business and what changed since that time as we have changed our position the card business fairly dramatically with the sales from international portfolios and even how we\u2019ve approached the U.S. is based on the dynamics of the card business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">The good news is the card business is starting to grow in terms of balances and going back to an earlier question we got rid of the non-core aspects and now you are seeing the core start to come through $1.1 to cards. People are using the cards more and the balance is growing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">And so I think that if you just think about that, that number is going to be \u2013 is today and will be the dominant part of the charge-off questions and you should think that $100-ish billion and balances as you look forward you would expect that to grow but not continue to stop dramatically, it\u2019s not for us to change dramatically in terms of positioning our balance sheet because we need to keep that book balance because there is higher charge-offs and period of unemployment level.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">So, I\u2019d say, if you went back and look at that that is the biggest core adjustment between the two items and then, the counter to that is, if you look at the appendix page as you see the charge-offs on the mortgage business in the first mortgage business again recoveries, but if you look at home equity side.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">You still have a charge-off rate which based on the underwriting criteria the stuff going on will be much higher and so we had a couple $100 million before the charge-offs that you can see on page 21. So we\u2019d expect to see improvement in that from where we are, but I\u2019d say the card business is kind of about as good, is getting very strong.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">If you look at home equity you can reversal from the recoveries on the first mortgage loans. But it is a fundamentally different level because we mix the balance sheet differently on purpose.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Steven Chubak \u2013 Nomura Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Okay, that's great. Thank you for taking my questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">And we\u2019ll go next to Paul Miller with FBR. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Paul Miller \u2013 FBR Capital Markets</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Yes, thank you very much. Going back to your LAS costs, excluding litigation, where you mentioned that it's probably \u2013 to get to that $1.1 billion target it\u2019s going to take another quarter or two. What should we be watching and how long do you think that LAS expenses are going to move to become non-material, I guess is another way to say it? Can you give us things, what we should be tracking?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Sure. The first thing I want to be clear Paul that the \u2013 getting to the $1.1 billion has moved back \u2013 maybe moved back one quarter not two.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Paul Miller \u2013 FBR Capital Markets</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">I'm sorry.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">We are looking at one quarter. The second though that the biggest item that really relates to the trajectory of LAS expenses is your number of 60 plus day delinquent loans, because the cost to service that is many multiples what the cost of servicing a current loan is. So, as you go forward, we have full limitation of the national settlement effective September 30.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">That will be a big benchmark and then as you go beyond then, as we said, one to two quarter lag you will see expenses trend down as your number of sixty plus day delinquent loans trend down and as those trend down, you need less people as well as a variety of other expenses. So that\u2019s the key metric to watch.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">And as it relates to just how long that\u2019s going to continue, I would not expect that we get down to the level of what should be a recurring number of 60 plus day delinquents until probably the end of 2015 or the first part of 2016, so as it relates to continued expense leverage, we would expect to see upside in that business probably all the way through the end of 2016 as it relates to driving expense down.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">And Paul we\u2019ve got work to do in a sense if we go back I think as we look at, I think at the fourth quarter of 2012 it was about $3.1 billion, the fourth quarter of 2013 I think it was $2.1 billion Bruce, and then, we said 1.1 \u2013 originally said higher then we brought down the $1.1 billion announced.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">I think it is somewhere little higher than that but that\u2019s the broad move and the question is how do you keep going on that and that is really going to be as Bruce said a number of 60 plus delinquent loans, it\u2019s largely where these people.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">But we are also getting condition as we now got the place stable and that\u2019s behind us so we can start to invest in technology that will add a level of improvement that we haven\u2019t been able to invest in while we just had to get the work done.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">And so we expect the systems deployment in that business as we move into the middle of 2015 and to 2016 and we expect consolidations of physical plans and things like that which will add to the expense leverage but we haven\u2019t been able to do that as much yet just because of just the mass of the amount of the work that had to take place.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">So, there is still lot of work ahead of the team but if you put in the context the $2 billion, this first quarter and expense reduction across eight quarters that lot of work has been done too.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Paul Miller \u2013 FBR Capital Markets</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">And just a follow-up, you talked about you do have another MSR sale, I don't know how material that is. But right now there has not been a lot of transfer of MSRs due to various \u2013 well, Lawsky, up in New York, questioning a lot of the stuff that other companies are doing. Is that \u2013 can that interfere with the sale or you think you can sell the MSR without the headline risk of Lawsky?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">The MSR sales that I referenced that will happen in the second half of the year. In the context of what we\u2019ve done is relatively small. It\u2019s just that the delinquency content associated with that sale is high. So it\u2019s material from that perspective, but from an overall size perspective it\u2019s not material.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Paul Miller \u2013 FBR Capital Markets</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Okay, guys. Thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">And we\u2019ll go next to Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Marty Mosby \u2013 Vining Sparks</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Thanks. I want to ask you a couple questions. First off, you've been harvesting about $400 million worth of gains out of the debt portfolio. Is that in the sense of trying to minimize your AOCI risk when rates do go up, as you're shortening the portfolio or just wanted to think about your strategy; because that's been a pretty consistent flow through over the last year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">As we look at those gains, we are committed to not \u2013 as we continue to see liquidity build not taking incremental OCI risk as I referenced. And so over the last year, even as the securities portfolios has grown, we\u2019ve managed to keep the OCI risk from an absolute dollar perspective relatively flat and as you see markets move up and down, obviously selling longer duration securities as you growth in the securities portfolio as part of that strategy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Marty Mosby \u2013 Vining Sparks</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">No I just want to make sure that the gains are just an outflow of that overall strategy that you had talked about.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Yes, you are exactly correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Marty Mosby \u2013 Vining Sparks</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Okay, when you look at the kind of the consumer and business bank, you have a considerable amount more in deposits than you really have in loans, which to me seems a little bit more skewed than what you would normally expect. How do you strategically think you can utilize that balance sheet funding over time or what are some of the initiatives that you are doing because you should be able to penetrate that customer base with more lending?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">That I think \u2013 yes, we should be able to penetrate on more lending. So, that if you look on page 17, you can see the \u2013 18 excuse me, you can see the growth in card originations, the growth in home equity originations, which go on a balance sheet as Bruce talked about early would put about, I\u2019d say half broadly stated of the originations and mortgages are going on the balance sheet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">And in the business banking segment which is a small part of our commercial banking segment here to \u2013 $50 million on the revenue companies we are actually starting to see net loan growth the first time and a lot of times as it been up for non-core portfolios and so that\u2019s the core opportunity in the franchise as it continued to originate credit to the core customer base and there is lots of opportunities there, but you can see us making progress against each quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">I think, on a broader context you got to think about these businesses and how they mix together. So in every company\u2019s retail business, it\u2019s an excess deposit generator just by the very nature of it and not only as it fund alone for the consumer customers but also provides the funding for the rest of the franchise.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">So, I think we have to keep that broader context and that\u2019s why we invest going to your first question on mortgages and securities to \u2013 lack of better term get the value out of those deposits for the shareholders.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">The other point that I just want to mention is that, historically, if you look at the front-end lending in consumer real estate that we\u2019ve done, from a segment perspective that that consumer real estate lending on a first mortgage basis, it shows up in the balance sheet and all other. So, you should \u2013 you can assume that those deposits that you see within page nine, a lot of the loans that they do for our customers are reflected in the all other segments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Marty Mosby \u2013 Vining Sparks</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">And then in the mortgage segment, the CRES, you are still, if you take out the litigation, generating about a $700 million negative loss in the sense of your just pre-tax pre-prevision of between the revenues and expenses. You are talking about bringing down the Legacy Assets &amp; Servicing expenses. But what is the timetable in your mind that would be reasonable to think of closing that $700 million gap?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">A couple of things, the first is, within consumer real estate services, if we look at the home loans business on the front-end, we talked about how we saw during the quarter that we increased both front-end originations as well as took down expense. So, Q1 to Q2 we saw about a $100 million improvement on the front-end of the business that\u2019s reflecting the consumer real estate services.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">And as it relates to the $700 million number that you quoted, we obviously, relative to the guidance have $300 million of expense to get out of that business over the next 90 days and then as we\u2019ve talked about earlier on the call, we\u2019ve got work to do to continue to drive that down significantly in both 2015 and the first part of 2016 and that\u2019s clearly one of the highest priorities we have within the company.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Marty Mosby \u2013 Vining Sparks</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">And just lastly, and thanks for letting me ask you a few questions. As if you are looking at valuation of your servicing portfolio, it dropped off to 82 basis points this quarter, which seems relatively low as the duration of that portfolio is extending. I know interest rates came back.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">So the models force you to write it back down. But when you're looking at the prepayment speeds and the refinancing behavior, it seems like eventually that there is some value as that portfolio lasts a lot longer than the model assumes at this point.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Well, I think your point, the value and the fact that on a basis point basis the came down was reflective of the lower rates that we saw at the end of the second quarter relative to the end of the first quarter and you are right, at a point in time when rates start to move out, you would expect that MSR to extend and for there to be value there, but we do not \u2013 I want to emphasize that we look to manage the MSR risk as part of the overall strategy and are mangling that to have it be a plat book.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Marty Mosby \u2013 Vining Sparks</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">While from an interest rate standpoint I understand that this seems like the models have assumed a lot faster prepayments than we\u2019ve really actually experience, which eventually has to true up?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">At the end of the day it comes down to what the customer does here, exactly right.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Marty Mosby \u2013 Vining Sparks</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">All right, thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">And we\u2019ll go next to Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Matt Burnell \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">The questions have been asked and answered. Thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Thanks, Matt.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">And we\u2019ll go next to Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Hi, a couple follow-ups. First on the deposit betas, I appreciate you giving us the color, for every 100 basis point increase it would help by $3.4 billion. You describe the deposit base. But what is the actual deposit beta that you use to come up with the $3.4 billion benefit?</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">We did not quote, Mike, the actual deposit data. We obviously go back and look at historical data. Our assumption is as it relates to pass through rates as far as how much of the first 100 basis points that has to get passes along, we are in the 40% area with respect to that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Okay, 40% for the first 100?</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">All right. So I think that's in the ballpark of one of your large peers, but below some others. And is the reason that would be below others just because it's a lot of branch-based deposits?</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">You are exactly correct and if we go back and look at what it\u2019s been throughout time, at points where arguably we don\u2019t have the competitive position now, we look at a lot of historical data to come up with that number.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">As it relates to expenses, you've achieved 90% of the $8 billion New BAC savings. I see the branches are 5023 and I think you said you wanted to be around 5,000 branches. And so if I heard you right, I think you're going from a period of rightsizing to growth. Is that a fair characterization?</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Yes, we\u2019ve been growing underlying activity. If you look at some statistics in the back things were up Mike, but you are right, the \u2013 if you go back a couple years ago we started New BAC we were running $59 billion of core expenses, now run at $13 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">And so we are largely getting there and then question then is now how do you hold at there in the economic and environment which is lower growth and traditionally expected in the United States and that\u2019s been \u2013 this vigilance on our part. But during the whole time period we\u2019ve invested literally thousands and thousands of people into the sales side and start to try that growth and we\u2019ll continue to do that. The question is how do you balance that investment grade.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">And I\u2019d just, Mike, before \u2013 I assume, the \u2013 achieving the balance of the $2 billion in quarterly New BAC savings in the fourth quarter is not dependent on future branch sales. So I just want to make sure that there is not an assumed linkage there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">And are you reallocating some of the people assigned to New BAC to other areas? It seems like you could dismantle that project group, so to speak?</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">It\u2019s not a big project, I mean, this is done by the people run the businesses, with just committed plans that we did this wasn\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s not a huge project group to actually accomplish. It\u2019s done by who have to run each business, each function.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Okay as it relates to loan pay-downs, Bruce, you mentioned that some bank loans declined as customers went to the capital markets. In a way, a type of disintermediation from the bank. But can you elaborate on that? Are you still seeing that this quarter? Do you think that was a one-off event or is that something we should watch out for?</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Our sense is from what we saw during the quarter, it was more a one-off event. There were a couple of loans that were for acquisition-related purposes that people then went out and refinanced. So that was just a little bit of an anomaly that we saw in the second quarter and if you look at just the attractiveness that the capital markets have been, you would expect that to largely be over.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">But every now and then when you deal with large multinational companies where some of the loan holds are little bit higher. You can have those one-time events where that happens and we had a little bit of that in the second quarter. It\u2019s not something we would expect to recur.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">What I'm getting to is, do you guys think this is an inflection point for loan growth? I can find one of your large peers who implied that it is; and I can find a large regional bank who says it's not. Where do you fall out on the spectrum? You said, Brian that middle-market utilization was up ever so slightly, can you just give us that utilization number and where you stand?</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">Bruce, gave it early, but I have to do again.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">Sure. The middle market utilization rate was kind of 37 plus percent at the end of the first quarter and was up about almost 1% to mid 38%, which I don\u2019t think in and of itself is not material, but it does seem that that people are a little bit more willing to access the revolving credits. At the same time practically speaking, you are not going to tend to see loan growth that\u2019s dramatically higher than the rate at which the overall economy is growing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">So, we clearly, as Brian Alluded to in his opening comments, we did see an economy that improved in the second quarter relative to the first quarter and on the commercial side, our loan growth is going to tend to mere or be a little bit above what we seen in the macro economy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">So do you think this is an inflection point for loan growth? Or is that an answer you would rather not delve into?</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">We\u2019ve seen \u2013 we are seeing signs of improvement, I am not sure I\u2019d go as far as saying it\u2019s an inflection point.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">Okay, at the Annual Meeting, the clock ran out on me before I could ask one question, a very simple, what are your financial targets with and without higher interest rates?</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">We\u2019ve been pretty consistent if we go back, I believe Mike \u2013 the third and fourth quarter earnings call, that as we look out to and as we look at and embed in our models of 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve that we are looking at that point with a tangible common equity ratio of 7% and return on asset of 1% to be at a 14% return on tangible common equity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">As you get into the \u2013 you don\u2019t see that rate environment until 2016 and if you look at those metrics and back out what we\u2019ve said a 100 basis points is worth to us on a parallel shift, you get a sense for what we need to get to ex the 100 basis point move.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">I'm sorry. So without the 100 basis point shift, the target for ROA and ROTCE is what?</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">That\u2019s going to be roughly $3.3 billion or $3.4 billion pre-tax and at $0.63 it\u2019s $2 billion less which on roughly $140 billion on tangible common equity is going to be about 20 basis points less on assets at that point.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">Okay. And then last question, as it relates to Citigroup's settlement with the DOJ for MBS securitizations and CDOs, you had quite a bit more in MBS securitizations and CDO structuring; and so how can we think about this number and the amount of reserves that you have, I read one press article that you were willing to offer $12 billion and the DOJ wanted $17 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">I know you can't go into too much detail on this. But can you just give us a framework for how you view resolving this? I mean, on the one hand you could argue maybe you shouldn't pay hardly anything because you bought a lot of these entities that created these deals and you are just punishing the new shareholders. And on the other hand, if you say that you had ten times the level of some of this MBS activity, it could be a huge number. So how should we think about that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">As we said, Mike, I think, we can\u2019t discuss that and you get a rendition of all the different criteria that people written about. I think this quarter we are able to put away the AIG case, which if you remember was back in 2011 lot of the people said it was worth a lot more money for $650 million. So we will continue to figure out where we get behind us a reasonable cost for our shareholders. We just can\u2019t talk about details on this.</p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"><strong>Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">All right, well, good job with the AIG. I was one of those people who thought it was going to be more, and it wasn't. But that's fine. I will take any guidance I can get on the legal costs ahead. Thanks a lot.</p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">Okay, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">And we\u2019ll take our last question from David Hilder with Drexel Hamilton, please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"><strong>David Hilder \u2013 Drexel Hamilton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">Thanks. Most of my questions have been answered. Just on the AIG settlement, I actually thought AIG was the only remaining objector, are there others?</p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">There are several other objectors that had not been as vocal and as I said, we\u2019ll have to see where it goes with that dropping out.</p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"><strong>David Hilder \u2013 Drexel Hamilton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">And AIG has agreed to dismiss all its claims or its objections, I should say? Okay, great.</p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">That\u2019s correct, it\u2019s part of the settlement agreement.</p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"><strong>David Hilder \u2013 Drexel Hamilton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">Great.

(Operator Instructions). Please note this call is being recorded and I will be standing by should you need any assistance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. Lee McEntire. Please go ahead, sir.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Lee McEntire</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning. Thanks everybody on the phone as well as the webcast for joining us this morning for our third quarter results. Hopefully you\u2019ve had a chance to review the earnings release documents available on our website.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Before I turn the call over to Brian and Bruce, let me just remind you, we may make some forward-looking statements today. For further information on those, please refer to either our earnings release documents, our website or our other SEC filings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">So with that, let me turn it over to Brian Moynihan, our CEO for some opening comments before Bruce goes through the details.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thanks, Lee, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us to review our third quarter results. As you know, our bottom-line results were heavily impacted by previously announced settlement with Department of Justice. But given that, I\u2019m still encouraged by what we accomplished this quarter. Our business has generated enough earnings to absorb the $5.3 billion charge and still reported positive net income before preferred dividends.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Now, the themes that we see are consistent with the past several quarters. You can see in our numbers a prudent balance sheet management; you can see in the numbers good core expense control; you can see in the numbers continued credit improvement and you can see in the numbers solid business activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Before Bruce takes you through the detail of the quarter, I thought I\u2019d focus quickly on the profitability of our business segments and some of the key statistics that give rise thereto. If you look, we\u2019ve included in the appendix the materials on pages 18 and 20 some information about net income, PPNR and business statistics.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">So you step back and look, you can see from our release, the company reported $2.9 billion in year-to-date pretax net income that includes and overcomes 15.6 billion in pretax litigation costs to resolve primarily legacy mortgage issues.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Now we\u2019re not suggesting that we want to incur litigation cost going forward but what this demonstrates is how much progress we\u2019ve made behind the noise of significant legal settlements. So you step back and think about the businesses, you can see on appendix slide 18 a graphic showing year-to-date net income comparative performance by the businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Let\u2019s first focus on our Consumer and Business Banking segment. Year-to-date net income was $5.3 billion in 2014. That compares to $4.6 billion after tax in 2013. The return on average allocated capital in Consumer &amp; Business Banking was 24%. It is our largest business and it\u2019s had a good year. Our Global Wealth and Investment Management business had net income of year-to-date of $2.3 billion in 2014 that\u2019s up 3% from 2013. Now this business, our GWIM business has a pretax margin of 26% and has returns on allocated capital of 25%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">As we move to our Global Banking business, that\u2019s the business provides lending, treasury services, investment banking activities to middle markets and large corporate clients around the world. That business earned $4 billion after tax so far this year, up 8% from 2013 and generated returns on allocated capital of 17%. Those three businesses together have great annuity streams and hold us in good state as we look forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Our Global Markets business which obviously is more affected by what\u2019s going on in the market on the given quarter has earned $2.9 billion after tax this year and for the first nine months versus $2.7 billion in 2013 when you adjust for DVA and in 2013 you exclude the UK tax changes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">So in total, these four businesses generated $14.5 billion net income after-tax for the first nine months of 2014. That $14.5 billion is up 10% from last year. You can look on slide 19 and you can see on a pretax pre-provision basis which some of you also focus on, we are 4% year-over-year. And you can see on pages 20 and 21 the business statistics over the last couple of years which give rise to these results.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We\u2019ve made real progress in the four businesses and we continue to work on the Consumer Real Estate segment and losses therein. But that real progress shows in the operating leverage profitability of these businesses and we expect that momentum to continue as we move the other side of the mortgage issues.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">With that, I'll turn it over to Bruce.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Thanks Brian and good morning everyone. This quarter does reflect what we believe is very solid execution and a lot of what we\u2019ve been consistently talking with all of you about. We maintained a strong balance sheet as a foundation to operate from. We continued to rationalize our balance sheet for liquidity, profitability as well as evolving regulatory changes. Our revenue has shown relative stability and our non-litigation expenses continue to be reduced. Charge-offs have continued to come down, and we resolved significant legacy mortgage exposures during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Let's start on slide two and go through the details. We recorded a $168 million of earnings in the third quarter and after preferred dividends that resulted in a loss of a penny per share. Earnings included the $5.3 billion pretax income -- or pretax impact, excuse me of the settlement with the Department of Justice in various state attorneys general that we announced in August. On an EPS basis, the impact was $0.43 a share, as a portion this charge was not tax deductable.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">As you can see on the right hand side of slide two, the $5.3 billion impact was split between $4.9 billion in litigation expense and $400 million in provision expense that relate to additional reserves that are associated with a consumer relief portion of this settlement.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Revenue during the quarter on an FTE basis was $21.4 billion versus $21.7 billion in the year ago quarter. If we exclude the DVA impact from both periods as well as the $1.2 billion of equity investment income that we recorded during the third quarter of \u201813 that was driven by gains from our CCB investment, adjusted revenue of $21.2 billion was up slightly from the third quarter of 2013.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">On a segment view, revenue was stable to modestly up in four of our five businesses from last year with CRES being the exception. Relative to the second quarter of 2014, revenue was 3% lower driven by the lack of equity investment gains, seasonally lower investment banking fees and lower mortgage banking revenue.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Total non-interest expense was $19.7 billion which included $5.6 billion in total litigation expense. We back out litigation expense; compared to the second quarter of 2014, expenses declined roughly $400 million from both our New BAC and our ALS cost initiatives as well as lower revenue related incentives. On the same basis, looking back to the third quarter of 2013, expenses improved by $1.1 billion or 7% which were driven by reduced LAS costs and to a lesser degree our New BAC cost savings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Provision for credit losses during the quarter was $636 million and included $400 million, as I mentioned for the DoJ Settlement, while our net charge-offs were $1 billion. Our results during the quarter did benefit from roughly $200 million in DVA or about a penny per share as our debt spread widened during the end of the quarter. There was also approximately $0.04 of benefit to earnings that relate to certain discrete tax items. Lastly, the quarter also benefited by about a penny as our weighted average share count excluded the impact of diluted shares given the financial performance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On slide three, we show you all the usual balance sheet highlights that we do each quarter but we did want to focus you specifically on our efforts to rationalize the balance sheet as our actions led to a $47 billion decrease from the second quarter of 2014. We took prudent actions to increase liquidity as well as to reduce both credit and market risk. We shifted the mix of some of our discretionary assets out of less liquid loans into more liquid debt securities. For example, we converted 6.5 billion of residential mortgage loans that benefited from standby insurance agreements into agency securities. We also sold $2.5 billion of non-performing and delinquent loans during the quarter and had $4 billion of net pay downs in our legacy consumer real estate loans. We reduced our global markets balance sheet and associated funding by $11.7 billion from the second quarter of \u201814 and that included low margin prime brokerage loans of approximately $3.3 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Our decline in quarter end deposits was primarily driven by optimization efforts that included the reduction of approximately 15 billion of deposits that had little to no benefit to our LCR ratio. From a capital perspective, I'll remind you that we did issue 3.1 billion of preferred stock during the quarter that improved our Basel III Tier 1 regulatory capital ratio. And lastly as a reminder, we increased our quarterly common dividend to $0.05 a share during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We move to slide four where we show our capital ratios under Basel III. Under the transition rules, our CET1 ratio was stable at 12%. If we look at our Basel III regulatory capital ratios on a fully phased-in basis, you can see CET1 capital declined 1.6 billion that was driven by a $1 billion decline in OCI.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Our operational risk weighted assets did increase that negatively impacted our advanced levels but not the standard levels. Other RWA balance sheet improvements benefited both approaches and that partially offset the increase in RWA under the advanced approach. If we look at the ratios under the standardized approach, CET1 improved slightly to 9.6% during the third quarter of \u201814 and under the advanced approach, the CET1 ratio was also at 9.6%, both well above our 8.5% 2019 proposed minimum requirements. If you look at our operational risk, risk weighted assets under the advanced approach; they now represent approximately 30% of our overall risk weighted assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We move to supplementary leverage. This is the first quarter that we've actually disclosed the actual ratios from a supplementary leverage perspective. The bank holding company during the third quarter was at 5.5%. And if we look at our primary banking subsidiary BANA, its ratio was 6.8% which is pro forma for September 30th as we merged FIA, our card services unit into BANA on October 1st. We\u2019re obviously very pleased with the capital and supplementary leverage ratios in the context of the resolution of the DoJ matter during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We turn to slide five, feel very good about the work that the funding team did during the quarter. In addition to the $3.1 million of preferred stock issuance, we issued 3 billion of Tier 2 subordinated debt, which also adds to our total capital metrics.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Lastly, we issued $4.5 billion of straight debt at the parent. Our goal is not only to build the Basel III non-CET1 component of the capital stack that we thought or levels that were appropriate, but also to build liquidity in advance of the payments that we\u2019ll make during the month of October for the DoJ and state AG settlement.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Total long-term debt for the quarter ended at $250 billion, which was down $7 billion from the end of the second quarter 2014. We look at the cost of our debt; our long-term debt yields improved 10 basis points from the second quarter of \u201814 due primarily to maturities of higher yielding debt as well as issuances at more favorable levels. Global access liquidity sources remained very strong at 429 billion and our time to required funding was stable at 38 months.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We turn to slide six; net interest income on a reported FTE basis was 10.4 billion, up from the second quarter of \u201814 as we had a less negative impact from market related adjustments and that was coupled with modest improvement in our adjusted net interest income.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">The market related adjustments during the quarter were a negative $55 million in the third quarter of \u201814 that compares to a negative $175 million in the second quarter of \u201814.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Net interest income of $10.5 billion excluding the market related adjustment, improved modestly as lower long-term debt balances and yield as well as an extra day of interest accruals were partially offset by lower loan balances as well as lower loan yields.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">The net interest yield improved 4 basis points on an adjusted basis and 7 basis points on an actual basis. We continue to remain positioned to benefit as interest rates move higher, particularly from the short end of the curve.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Since we\u2019re largely done at this point with our debt footprint reductions, the direction as well as the trajectory of our net interest income and net interest yield will be more dependent on rates as well as balance sheet movements going forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">And given the volatility of the rates, should the opportunity present itself, we could decide to take actions to reduce OCI risk in preparation for what we will be in an eventual rising rate environment. Those actions could have a relatively small near term impact to net interest income but reduced our duration risk as well as to provide additional liquidity to reinvest in a higher rate environment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Non-interest expense on slide seven was $19.7 billion in the third quarter of \u201814 and included $5.6 billion of litigation expense. As I previously mentioned, $4.9 million of the expense related to the DoJ Settlement while the remainder was associated with the number of smaller pre-existing cases, one of which caused us to book approximately $200 million in our Global Markets business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We exclude litigation; total expenses were $14.2 billion this quarter which declined $400 million from the second quarter of 2014 on both, our New BAC as well as our LAS initiatives as well as lower revenue related incentive cost. Compared to the third quarter of \u201813, expenses are $1.1 billion lower, driven by LAS cost savings. Our legacy assets and servicing cost once again ex-litigation reduced by approximately a $100 million in the quarter and remained on track to hit $1.1 billion in the first quarter of 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In the third quarter, we\u2019ve now reached our new BAC savings initiatives with the targeted goal of $2 billion a quarter or $8 billion on an annualized basis. So, as we move forward, we believe that expenses apart from litigation as well as the continued reductions in legacy assets and servicing expenses should move more directionally with the revenue streams that we see in the businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Asset quality on slide eight, you can see credit quality continued to improve. Net charge-offs declined slightly from the second quarter of \u201814 to $1 million or a 46 basis-point net loss ratio, a new decade low. NPL sales which I mentioned produced modest recovery in both the second quarter of \u201814 as well as the third quarter of \u201814. And if we normalize for those benefits, net charge-offs would have been $1.3 billion in the second quarter of '14 and $1.2 billion in the third quarter of '14 with the third quarter being about 8% lower.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Delinquencies, a leading indicator of net charge-offs remained very low. Our third quarter provision expense was 636 million and we released 407 million of reserves, given the continued pace of asset quality improvement. If we exclude the reserve that was associated with the DOJ Settlement, we released 807 million from our reserves.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Let's now focus on the businesses, starting on slide nine with Consumer &amp; Business Banking. Results again this quarter showed year-over-year improvement as our net income grew 4% to 1.9 billion and increased 3% from the second quarter of 2014. This business generated 25% return on allocated capital during the third quarter. Revenue was relatively stable at 7.5 billion compared to the third quarter of '13 and up from the second quarter of '14, led by higher card income and service charges for both comparative periods.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">As you can see on the slide, Q3 provision expense was lower than the third quarter of \u201813 as net charge-offs improved and we also released less reserves. Expenses of 4 billion were stable compared to both periods as the benefits from our net book delivery optimization were offset by investments that we made in our special sales force.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">With regard to the special sales force, over the course of the last year, we've added nearly 500 financial solutions advisors and small business bankers. Growth in mobile as well as other self-service customer touch points has allowed us to continue to reduce our banking centers where we went below 5,000 units during the quarter, while at the same time, our customer satisfaction scores continued to improve and customer activity continues to build.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We look at customer activity during the quarter. We had good deposit growth and our rates paid remained very low. We experienced modest improvement in average loans on a linked quarter basis driven by activities that we saw within the U.S. consumer credit card business. Brokerage assets were up 21% year-over-year as we benefited from both improved account flows and market valuation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Our mobile banking customers reached over 16 million during the quarter and 11% of all of our customer deposit transactions are now done through mobile devices. Card issuance remained strong at 1.2 million new accounts in the third quarter of \u201814 with 64% of those cards going to existing customers of our company. And lastly, credit quality continued to improve as our U.S. credit card loss rate fell below 3% and where we continue to see north of a 9% risk adjusted margin.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">If we moved to consumer real estate services; as I mentioned, the loss in the quarter was driven by the DOJ settlement, which impacted expense, provision, as well as income tax. Revenue was down about $300 million from the second quarter of 2014. The servicing income component of revenue was driven by an approximate $100 million charge to adjust our MSR for cost of service assumptions. And a smaller amount in our level of servicing assets did decline.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Our production revenue decline was driven by approximate $80 million increase in rep and warrant expense. First mortgage retail origination of $11.7 billion, were up 6% from the second quarter of 2014. If we look at the pipeline at the end of the quarter, our first-lien origination pipeline was down 12% from the second quarter of 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On the home equity front, we continue to see very good demand where originations during the quarter were $3.2 million, which were up nicely on both the linked quarter and a year-over-year basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Expenses once again included $5.3 billion of litigation costs during the quarter versus $3.8 billion in the second quarter of 2014. If we exclude that $1.5 billion increase in litigation cost, expenses declined a $117 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Our LAS expense for the quarter was just over $1.3 billion and once again remains on track to hit $1.1 billion in the first quarter of 2015. Our number of 60 plus day delinquent loans of $221,000 that are serviced by LAS dropped $42,000 or 16% from the end of the second quarter of \u201814. In addition, we continue to reduce our production staffing levels in line with the market opportunity as we continue to lower our fulfillment cost.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On slide 11, global wealth and investment management delivered another strong quarter, where we saw both record revenues, as well as record earnings. Pre-tax margins remained strong, north of 25% for the 7th consecutive quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Record asset management fees drove revenue higher, but were offset by some softness in transactional activity, although I do want to mention that we did see transactional activity pickup during the month of September.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Net income of $830 million was up 12% on a linked quarter basis as the business continues to focus on operating leverage and drop the revenue growth to the bottom-line. We increased the number of financial advisors and year-to-date the retention of our more experienced advisors remains at record levels.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Client balances were nearly $2.5 trillion with negative market valuation mostly offset by positive flows that we saw during the quarter. Long-term AUM flows were $11.2 billion during the quarter, the 21st consecutive quarter of positive flows. Ending client loan balances also increased to a record level from the second quarter of \u201814 as we see good activity in both securities-based and residential mortgage lending. And return on allocated capital in this segment was 27% during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">If you turn to slide 12, global banking earnings were $1.4 billion, which is up 24% from the third quarter of \u201813 on both on lower credit cost and to a lesser degree higher revenue. Compared to the second quarter of \u201814, earnings were up on lower credit costs, which were slightly offset by seasonally lower investment banking fees.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Return on allocated capital during the quarter was strong at 18%. Within the revenue line item, investment banking fees for the company this quarter were $1.4 billion, which is up 4% from the year ago quarter, but down seasonally from the second quarter of 2014. Our overall investment banking pipeline does remained very strong, but I do want to note that our fourth quarter of \u201813 was a record quarter from an investment banking fee perspective. Provision during the quarter was a slight benefit, which reflected continued low loss rates and a small reserve release.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">If we look at the balance sheet, average loans were $267 billion, which is up 3% compared to the year ago period, but which has slowed over the past couple of quarters as we continue to focus on client profitability. We've also seen some significant prepayments from some of our larger corporate banking clients during the last couple of quarters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Although our average deposits during the quarter did increase, our end of period balances declined. And that's due as I mentioned earlier, that we intentionally managed down certain deposits which have a little LCR benefit.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">If we move to Global Markets on slide 13, we earned $769 million during the third quarter of 2014. To put the third quarter of \u201814 on a like basis to the third quarter of \u201813, you should exclude a $1.1 billion impact from the UK tax rate change that we saw in the third quarter of \u201813, as well as the impact of DVA for both periods. Once again DVA this quarter was a benefit of $205 million versus a decrement of $444 million last year. If we make those adjustments, we saw very strong growth in earnings of 21% on a year-over-year basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Earnings are down from the second quarter of \u201814 as a result of the typical seasonal declines in sales and trading, as well as higher litigation expense during the third quarter of \u201814 within this segment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">If we back out DVA, revenue is up 7% from the year ago period driven by strong sales and trading results. We're pleased to report both FICC and equity sales and trading revenues were up versus the year ago period. FICC revenues were up 11%. The improvement was driven by results and currencies given the increased volatility that we saw during the month of September, as well as improved performance in both our mortgages and our commodities areas.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Equity sales and trading was up as well, up 6% from the third quarter of \u201813 driven by a higher client financing revenues. On the expense front, they were up 2% year-over-year driven by higher revenue-related incentives. Relative to the second quarter, expenses were up $70 million from the second quarter due to higher litigation expense. If we back out the $200 million litigation expense during the quarter, expenses declined by about $130 million in line with the lower revenue levels on a linked quarter basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Average trading-related assets were down about $13 billion from the second quarter of \u201814 and our overall bar remains very low. Return on allocated capital during the quarter was 9%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">On slide 14, we show all other. Our non-interest revenue during the quarter was down on a year-over-year basis as we had $1.1 billion of equity investment gains in the third quarter of \u201813 and during the third quarter of \u201814, we had a $300 million charge for UK payment protection insurance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Expenses on a year-over-year basis are down about $400 million due to lower litigation expense and all other, as well as lower personnel costs. Income tax expense is included within all other is the benefit related to discrete items that I mentioned earlier are largely reflected in this segment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">As we look at the fourth quarter of this year, we'd expect the tax rate to be roughly 31%, absent any unusual items during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So before we open it up for questions, I'd like to summarize the quarter. We feel we made once again very good progress during the quarter. We saw good business activity across the customer footprint. This led to year-over-year earnings improvements in four out of the five businesses. And then in our mortgage business, we're taking cost out of the legacy assets and servicing side and have taken cost out of the fulfillment side as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">We generated enough earnings during the quarter from the businesses to offset a significant charge to settle our RMBS issues with the DOJ and RMBS working group. And at the same time maintain a very strong capital position. Asset quality continued its trend of improvement. And we did take some delivered balance sheet actions to improve liquidity, manage OCI risk and reduce both credit and market risk.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And we'll go ahead now and open it up for questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p7\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">(Operator Instructions). We'll go first to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Hi, thanks very much. Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Good morning Betsy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So just wanted to touch on a couple of things that you mentioned during your prepared remarks here; one is on the NII actions that you were talking about you might take with the securities portfolio as a way to protect OCI. But it might have a hit on the top-line when you do that. Could you just talk through what kind of size you're thinking about and what the triggers for that action might be?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Sure. A couple of things, Betsy, I think the first thing is if you look at the balance sheet from the second quarter to the third quarter and you look at the securities portfolio you can see that group see the entire increase in the securities portfolio related to treasury securities that tend to have a maturity in the 4 to 5 year life perspective as opposed to longer dated agencies securities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">The second thing that I mentioned is just in references what we would look to do with respect to our buy ticket during the fourth quarter. And I think at this point we\u2019re being very cautious looking at that buy ticket given the overall rate environment that we see that\u2019s 30 to 35 basis points lower than what we saw during the second quarter of 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And there is also a little bit of relative spot risk that you have as we look out. And I\u2019d say if we aggregate those two items and put it in a context of NII risk for the quarter, those two items could be roughly a $100 million of risk relative to what we saw during the second quarter, excuse me during the third quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. And then obviously a question that a lot of people have is the current rate environment and what that impact is. So this is in addition to the typical negative impact on NII from the long end of the curve, I would assume?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">The $100 million risk that I referenced is relative to the actual net interest income in the third quarter once we back out for market related items.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Got it, got it. Okay. And then the other comment was on expenses where you indicated that you are obviously done with New BAC, which is fantastic and LAS is on track. So outside of the LAS expense reductions, more directionally expenses would move in line with revenue. Could you give us a sense as to what you think you could do on expenses in the event that the long end of the curve stays where it is right now, hovering at like $2.01?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Sure. And I think that there is negative standpoint too Betsy if you look out what we\u2019ve done if you look at the number of FTEs that we have which tends to drive a lot of the expense were down 7% year-over-year and down 2% on a linked quarter basis. And you see the flow through of those benefits through a number of line items.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">The most important things to look at is if you go to our supplemental materials and flip to page four, we show you 9 different expense items. And if you look at those line items and exclude the other category, which include litigation expense, all these lines items are down both on a linked quarter and a year-over-year basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So as we continue to be efficient and continue to manage down overall headcount as a result of the various programs we've talked about, as well as just generally, you continue to see grind down expenses across all categories across the company.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And Betsy just to put in a broader perspective, how would you manage the company if the low rate environment continues is a lot like we've been managing and now continuing to be careful in every expense item, every headcount, but at the same time, investing in the business. And so if you think over the last year we've added small business bankers and financial service advisors the people work in the branches for Merrill Lynch and the Merrill Lynch teams. We've added sales mortgage officers in the retail segment, while we reduced the overall numbers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And so we've been able to accomplish the reduction expenses, but at the same time we're making the investments $3.5 billion in technology last year and probably 3.3 or so this year. So we'll continue to make those investments. So that means that the new BAC implement helps offset any kinds or sort of inflationary growth you get in and on top of that we continue to work on initiatives, continue to simplify the company and eliminate non-core products et cetera to continue to keep the expenses where they are.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So just to rephrase, you still have expense reduction coming through from the work that you've done so far; you're just not going to name it something new?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">No, we were just going to -- we were just doing a daily work that we need to do. And remember we're offsetting all the inflation and healthcare costs and wages and everything that goes on in normal days, but we even made the raw reduction and talk about now this business is usual good work.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay, super. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And we'll go next to Glenn Schorr with ISI. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Hi, thanks very much. On slide 8 is this tiny uptick in consumer 30 day past due. It's a small number, but it's the first time I've seen it go up in a long time. Credit outlook is great. Just curious if that denotes like a bottoming and what you're seeing. And then in conjunction with that, how you feel about your -- what appears to be very large loan allowance as a percentage of charge-offs?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Sure. Now we went back and notice the same thing Glenn, there are few item that were 10s, 20s and 30s that rounded, but as we go out and look at as we\u2019ve freshened up and look forward I would say that the forward look on credit as we look forward relative to when we looked at it last quarter, we do continue to see continued improvement, albeit at a slower pace from a charge-off perspective once you adjust for the non-performing loan sales.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">That's good; that's comforting. You mentioned the $3 billion of sub debt that you issued during the quarter. Just curious if there is any thought process of is that getting ahead of OLA and do you feel that there is going to be a sub debt component? Is that just you being cautious and having some diversification in the debt structure?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I think as we look out and as you look to fill up the various non-CET1 bucket, you can see that we obviously had the Buffet Series T in May and we've issued about $4.6 billion to get over largely filled up on the preferred bucket and the sub debt issue of $3 billion was relative to approximately $5 billion to fill up that bucket from an overall capital perspective. And at this point I would say from an OLA perspective, we continue to read what you do. We feel like we've been very prudent in building up this significant debt stack at the parent. And we'll just have to see where the regulation goes from here and we're obviously waiting to see exactly what that is.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay, last one. On mortgage, just curious what percentage of current originations you're keeping on balance sheet and then related part two would be how much is the unfinished question around repurchase risk constraining any mortgage lending or is it really still a function of demand at this point?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">The first as it relates to the balance sheet, I believe it was roughly two-thirds of the production from a first-lien perspective would have gone on the balance sheet during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">In terms of just origination quality, we continue to focus as we have quite a long time here on originating high quality prime mortgages, while still facilitating our duties to get customers credit for home purchases. The originations continue to rise. The purchase component obviously is rising too. So we feel good about where we are and you can see that new purchase requests from the agencies have come down dramatically. So we are not going to change the course, because at the end of the day, because we feel good about the credit quality we've taken. We're taking on using for ourselves and for investor.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. Thanks both.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And we'll go next to Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Hey, good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Two questions; first on governance, can you just kind of talk through the reasoning on the Board's perspective to kind of change the chairmanship and with a lead director how you think that dynamic may change, good or bad? And I guess secondly is this a vote of confidence in you, Brian, in terms of the leadership and current strategy?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">We have a strong Board team with various people of various skills and background and that diversity really helps us. And so I think the Board\u2019s decision that we put out few weeks ago and announcements made, this is continued great governance can we make commitment to good governance, Jack Bovender new director takes over from Chad Holliday, who served as Chair for about 4.5 years and did great job for us and the Board is very committed to continue to have the strong governance especially in the high expectations from the regulators and enhanced supervisor prudential standards from the Fed.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And so we feel good about the governance, but it\u2019s the team effort and then how the Board works together. And I think your points Chad maybe now in the announcement or that the Board feels very good about the option for the management team and this is part of their progression in that regard.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And does the Fed take part in reviewing this decision in anyway?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">It\u2019s the Board\u2019s decision, but we console those regulations all the major decisions in the company. But I think the key is how we operate as a Board and how we govern the company and I think it will be better for the shareholders as it has been.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay, great. And then second question on the balance sheet, with the $47 billion reduction, clearly it helps the LCR, but can you give us a sense on how it benefited -- I'm sorry, the SLR, but can you give us a sense on how it might have improved your LCR, number one and if there is any additional benefits beyond leverage that helps the stress test?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">A couple of questions, the first thing as we focus on the deposit I wouldn't say it benefited LCR but what it enabled us to do was to continue to rationalize the balance sheet without hurting LCR. That relates to the deposit optimization.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">With respect to the mortgage loans, the 6.5 billion that we\u2019ve referenced where we converted mortgage loans into agency securities, that's basically taking $6.5 billion of non-LCR benefit asset and converting them to $6.5 billion of LCR benefit. So that would have been the one pick up of the activities that we mentioned as well as just the reinvestment of repayment of legacy loan proceeds into securities once again helps LCR.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So the actions with respect to build, one under the key balance sheet benefited LCR, the 15 billion of deposits just enable us to rationalize the overall size of balance sheet. As it relates to CCAR and the actions that then are taken, as we look to manage the company, we continue to look to manage out the higher risk categories of loans. And if you look at what we did in the second quarter with just over 2 billion of non-performing loan sales and $2.5 billion this quarter, we would clearly expect that as you look at those from a CCAR perspective, they would be higher loss content loans relative to the rest of the portfolio but the rational and the goal to move those out was to reduce the risk in a market environment that was very favorable. And we feel good about those actions that we took.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So, is it fair to assume that you guys are near at the 100% LCR threshold? And I guess secondarily, should we expect balance sheet growth start -- loan deposit growth, balance sheet start to pick up from here or you\u2019ll have more to do?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So from an overall LCR perspective at the parent, we\u2019re at approximately 110% at the parent, so we're well in excess of where we need to ultimately be in 2017.Within the bank levels, we\u2019re well above the 80% level and would look to drive that to be north of 100% during the first half of 2015, well in advance of the 2017 implementation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And as it goes, as we move forward and we look at the balance sheet, the goal as we go forward and you saw a little bit, it's interesting, if you compare the loans in the three principal businesses where we make loans in the segments that we\u2019ve laid out here and that would be in our consumer business, in our wealth management business as well as in our global banking business that loans, average loans within those segments are up about 2% on a year-over-year basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And we\u2019re clearly very focused on looking to drive out and push out and grow loans. We\u2019re obviously focused on growing deposits with our core customers, which will benefit LCR as well. And I think as it relates to the overall size of the balance sheet, we want to continue to be more efficient, but I don't think you're going to see the magnitude to move in the balance sheet going forward that you saw during this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay, great. That's helpful, thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And we\u2019ll go next to Jon McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Jon McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Hi Bruce, I wanted to follow-up on the NII outlook and the potential strategic actions. Is the potential 100 million headwind on the core NII, does that reflect the possible strategic actions or is that just reflecting the fact that reinvestment rates or the maturing capitals are lower today than they were in the second quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">It would reflect two things, Jon. It's both the role to spot risk as well as the buy ticket during the fourth quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Jon McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. And this buy ticket or these kind of actions that you might take, how might they impact your projections of rate sensitivity to rising short and long rates?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Well, to the extent that we don't reinvest in buildup cash, it will increase our asset sensitivity and the benefit to rising rates when that occurs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Jon McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. So you're not talking about a major restructuring of the bond portfolio; it's just being patient in terms of investing, I think I might have misunderstood the actions?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes. It should -- this is much more Jon I think just realizing what we've seen during the quarter and being cautious on buy ticket during the fourth quarter to manage net interest income risk with OCI risk. But we're not talking about any kind of material shift; we're just flagging something for you to get into magnitude of the rate move that we've seen so far this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Jon McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Got it. Okay, totally understood. Thank you. And Bruce, just in terms of the FAS 91 or the premium amortization charges that move around with the 10 year, is that pretty proportional to how the 10 year moves up and down or are there levels where it stops kind of being a straight-line impact?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I would say that the -- it tends to move, the FAS 91 moves most and it's most correlated to the 10 year. And I would say that if you look at OCI risk it tends to be more correlated to long-term mortgage rates.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Jon McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. And just a follow-up on the provision, just wondering how we should think about kind of jumping off point for the provision relative to the kind of $600 million reported, or the $200 million ex-DOJ this quarter? How should we think about where to start off with that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes. I think Jon, I would look at the charge-offs adjusted for the portfolio sales that we said came down from 1.3 to 1.2 and assuming the overall economic environment doesn\u2019t change. We have continued to see improvements in the credit portfolios. And I think practically speaking if you look at the reserve release during the quarter once you adjust for the DOJ amount of 400 that you\u2019re not going to see reserve releases. I think clearly they will be a fair bit below the $800 million that we would have seen this quarter on an adjusted basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Jon McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. That's helpful. And then just on capital builds, Bruce, it seems like you're still able to grow the Tier 1 common at a multiple of the GAAP earnings. Is that primarily as DTA and could you remind us what the status of the DTA balance is and how much is disallowed currently?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Sure. The disallowed amount continues to be in the $15 billion to $16 billion criteria. And as we look out between now and the end of 2015, we would expect to that the CET1 should build generally consistent with pre-tax earnings all the way through the end of 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Jon McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thank you, Jon.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And we\u2019ll go next to Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Hi, good morning. Were there any gains from the $2.5 billion of NPA sales?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I believe between what came through in the charge-off line and the net, I think the NPAs were roughly $150 million, Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">$150 million gain?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. And as far as the outlook for rates, have you changed your rate assumption for the next year, given what the 10 year has done?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">We look at rate assumptions what we do is when we go through our internal forecasting process, we snap and manage the business just based on the forward curve of what the market is telling us. And clearly I think if we look out at and look at the rate movement that we've seen over the course of the last couple of weeks, people are obviously more cautious if rates may not be moving up at the level that they had had, but it's clearly been very volatile over the last 30 days.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And is that changing the way you're managing the portfolio or the company? In other words, at what point do you look at the low rate environment and say our prior assumptions might have been off a little bit; we need to revise the approach?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Well, I think that as we look forward, Mike, and I think it's a little bit of why we said what we did about a little bit of caution during the fourth quarter that at this point as we look out and given the impact that OCI has the capital until we see where rates settle out if they continue to move around, we continue to be very cautious with the buy ticket and when we do it we're investing clearly a little bit shorter than longer at this point given the risk that OCI has the capital and being mindful of that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Sure. No, it's tough figuring out the rate environment right now. I'm just revisiting the comment you made. You said expenses should move more directionally with revenues. And if I look at the first 9 months, I guess revenues are down, but expenses are down more. Do you mean that instead of having positive operating leverage, it might be flat operating leverage looking ahead?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I think there is couple of things, Mike. The first is that I want to make sure that we emphasize is that we still have a couple of $100 million of expenses to get out in the LAS area between now and the first quarter of 2015. And clearly, $1.1 million of LAS expenses that we\u2019ve set to get too in the first quarter of '15 is not where we would expect to operate on a longer term basis and there is additional work that we need to do there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">The second area, just broadly speaking that we highlighted that clearly we'd expect given what litigation expense that over time is going to come down. And then the third thing and when I said directionally expenses moving with revenues is just if we look at some of the areas particularly within the wealth management area that we've seen, there is a component of compensation and incentive, it\u2019s very clearly tied to revenues, not unlike what you see within the global banking and the global market space.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. And then two questions for Brian or perhaps for you Bruce; and I know I asked this before. But if rates do not go higher in 2015, what is Bank of America\u2019s ROE target?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I think if rates don\u2019t go higher, what you see in terms of earnings is what we're -- what we\u2019ve got to drive to this quarter. So Mike, when you look at the charts Bruce showed you and I showed, you can see that the core businesses burned several billion dollars after-tax this quarter and CRES business took it away; and as that comes down, you'll see those earnings flow through.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">We don't -- and so you can compute the ROE based on that. But basically we're -- you can see on page 18, the net income levels across the businesses each quarter. And our job is to take commercial real estate business, which is you see for the year-to-date, if you take to commercial real estate business which is loss money, get that back to breakeven. And that\u2019s the work we will do in absence of rate rising; it\u2019s not a lot different than it is right now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And then lastly, just following up from the other question relating to the separation of the CEO and the Chairman role, when you can consult with regulators, do they care one way or another if the CEO and Chair position is split? And there is several corporate governance experts who say that it's better to have those two roles split and others say it doesn't matter. Do you know what the regulator view is on that, because you're going from what some consider a preferred corporate governance approach putting the CEO and Chair role to now combining them? </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I think that what they have been cleared about in the published documents, published by the OCC and their heightened standards, their enhanced standards but recently in the Fed, they care about the engagement of the board and the diversity of the board and the experience of the board and we have a good board and it's experienced and has all the diversity and credible challenge and all the words that are used to describe that. And I'd see that's the core of the governance point that they make.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Alright. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And we'll go next to Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Good morning. If I could just follow up on some of the capital commentary provided, especially on the deck; it seems like there is a number of adjustments that were made this quarter or just quite after the quarter you consolidated the bank subs, there is some increase in operational risk RWA. You comment on OCI managing for that. Just think kind of big picture on managing capital, what's left and is there opportunity to bring down some of the off balance sheet exposures, now that you have kind of more final roles on the SLR?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Sure. I think I would start and just reiterate as we look at capital on a go forward basis, you basically have three items that are going to affect things. The first is your level of profitability and I just want to reiterate that we would expect once again on a go forward basis to accrete capital on a pre-tax basis. And the second is the impact that OCI has to those capital ratios, we obviously saw during the quarter rates went up on the mortgage side, I believe it was about 5 basis points during the quarter. And there were some security gains as well and that was what was led to the change in the overall OCI. And as I said before, given the environment we\u2019re in where rates are down about 30 basis points so far quarter-to-date that will have a benefit today to capital and we\u2019re just mindful of reinvesting so that we don\u2019t take on any greater OCI risk on a go forward basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">As it relates to what we\u2019re looking through and as you look at the overall risk-weighted asset work that\u2019s been done, I would say that clearly as we continue to work through the legacy home equity, as well as the first mortgage portfolios that do not benefit from the stand-by agreement as we continue to work those assets down that should enable us to grow the core and still keep risk-weighted assets generally constant. And I think more specific to your point, the other two things are that we continue to look to work through and we have the run-off of some of the structured credit and other portfolios that we\u2019re trying to accelerate that come off between now and 2017.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And then the last piece that we continue to work hard on and you saw it in the up risk that as we updated the models for the time series you do have the increase to risk-weighted assets. And we\u2019re working hard to get to where we need to be from that model perspective as we would hope in 2015 if we\u2019re successful to go ahead and exit parallel run at that point.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. And then as you think about -- I guess the adjustment on the operational risk RWA side, do you think that's about done or is it an ongoing process until you hopefully exit the parallel run?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yes. I think it's obviously as others have noted, it's an ongoing process. I think the important thing is if you compare our operational risk number relative to our peers, we're roughly 30%. And if you do the math against the risk-weighted assets, we're at the, if not the top, the upper-end of where others are from that. But we obviously have work to do to get that finalized to be in a position to exit.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. And then just separately within the C&amp;I lending book, you talked about pricing pressure, as well as some pay downs, but I guess specifically on the pricing pressure, what are you seeing now versus a quarter or two ago when you were still trying to grow or growing the book in terms of not just the magnitude of pricing, but what types of products?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Sure. I would say that the most competitive area that we continue to see is within the commercial banking space of our Global Banking segment which are those middle market type companies that tend to be loans that have one or two banks provide all of the credit. And clearly the remaining services that go along with servicing those customers tends to go to those that provide the credit. And that's where you've seen the most competition.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I think it's interesting if you look at and go back to our table on the international side as we've continued to shape the balance sheet and look for a return, you've actually seen a step-up in the yield in our international lending activity. And within the large corporate space of our Global Banking space, we have seen some stability in yields within that. So and really focused most importantly it's within the commercial, the middle market commercial space where we're seeing the most pressure on yields.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So just to add a little color there, our view was along two dimensions. One, on the international side, we had strong loan growth, a couple of years ago in the last year. And now we have to materialize our structured management and other revenue streams under increasing our credit exposure and Tom and the team growing the business. So, there is sort of -- with growth of loans that there has to be a fall through of growth of transaction revenue et cetera.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And on the middle market, I think the team went for optimization and we are going to continue to stress if they needed to be able to manage both the optimization and the growth of the portfolio. So we're pushing on them, they get the balance probably back a little bit more in SKUs than they had in the last couple of quarters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay, alright. Thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And we'll go next to Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Good morning, this is Guy. A question on, first of all, the optimization that you talked about with respect to commercial deposits around $15 billion and the -- I think roughly $12 billion in securities financing transactions. Should we look at those two things as directly related to each other?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I think they\u2019re related to each other that we think it's prudent balance sheet management. But there are independent actions that are part of prudent balance sheet management.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So Guy it's dramatically, but not necessary directly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. So the $15 billion isn't all essentially prime brokerage-related as well like the asset reduction that you are talking about?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">No, it's not.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. That's helpful. Another question is with respect to the provision related to the DOJ settlement. Should we look at this $400 million, which as you said offset what would have been an $800 million reserve release? Should we look at that as essentially now a one-time true up and going forward you now feel that you have the provision that you\u2019ll need for multiple years to fulfill the settlement terms or is the settlement going essentially be a pay as you go through the provision?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So, to be clear, when we set out the $5 billion reserve or the $5.3 billion hit this quarter that was to cover cash payments as well as all expected cost associated with implementing our $7 billion of consumer release. And the part of it that flows into the provision line item is $400 million, that is a reserve to take care of the -- what would have been the P&amp;L impact from the modifications that would happen within the different loans that we're modifying.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So, on a go forward basis, assuming that we\u2019ve got to set up the way that we do, there should not be any future P&amp;L impact from DoJ. The only impact that will be on the balance sheet is you see the reserve number come down as we implement the consumer relief programs. </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Got it. That's a very helpful explanation. Thanks. And finally, cyber security issues, obviously you were not the bank that\u2019s been in the crosshairs here and yet I would imagine that this is something that has caused some consternation internally and some spending. JP Morgan has talked about a $250 million budget for cyber security issues, which is expected to double. Can you give us a sense for what you are spending there and how you'd expected to increase?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Obviously, it\u2019s the matter that we take very seriously from the Board engagement, the talent that we have in the Board to help us with this all the way through management, Cathy Bessant, her team in tech and ops. And we spend hundreds of millions of dollars on a year and it\u2019s been growing. And we expect to continue to grow; it\u2019s the key to keep our customers and our teammates secure. And we continue to work on it. So, this is nothing but hard work and we continue to work with both the law enforcement authorities, various government agencies and among our industry through very straight moves and formal engagements to try to drive our competencies in industry up. So we\u2019re spending a lot of money on it, several hundreds of millions of dollars and we expect that to continue to increase.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thanks. I actually do have one more, if that\u2019s all right, and it\u2019s with respect to the rep and warranty RPL which in the footnote you said it\u2019s the same as it was last quarter at about $4 billion. Can you update us on where you are with any lawsuits related to the non-country wide originations which are, which add up to around $420 billion of UPB?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So, if you recall Guy, what we\u2019ve done and what we continue to refine each quarter is that as we continue to see rep and warrant claims, there was a reserve setup back in the second quarter of 2011, a piece of it was for Gibbs &amp; Bruns. There was a piece of it that was for bank issued rep and warrant and then there was a piece that was for third party. And we obviously look at those reserves each quarter and adjust those reserves for the activity in those cases where we have enough activity to have our reserve. We obviously have those into those areas that are still uncertain; we provide the range of possible laws. And as you reference the range of possible loss with respect to rep and warrant activity continues to be up to $4 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay, so no movement there obviously this quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">That's correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yes. Thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And we'll go next to with Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Good morning, guys, a quick one on loan growth. So at first glance, it looked kind of weak. It seemed to be driven by consumer. I just want to make sure I've got sort of the right adjustments here that I think you guys have laid out. In mortgage, $12.5 billion decline sequentially, but should we be backing out the $2.5 billion of NPL sales and then the $6.5 billion of agency conversion from that decline so you know you get kind of like a normalized decline rate sequentially of more like $3.5 billion on the mortgage side?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Yes. I think it's a good question. So the decision to move the 6.5 loan to security forum was based on LCR. It doesn't change the fact that when you move out, but you still have the asset on the balance sheet. So I think that $6.5 billion is a fair adjustment to make. And I would agree that the $2.5 billion where we still have the non-performing loans and quite frankly there is not much left there to attack. It's a fair adjustment which gets you to the $9 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">The other thing when you look at the loans that I do think is important is that from -- on the home equity side, with those legacy home equity portfolios which we want to get repaid that repayments within those were roughly $3.5 billion which were greater than the funded amount that came on from a new home equity origination perspective.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So I come back to that within those more discretionary portfolios what's happening there is what we want to happen there that they\u2019re repaying and we're converting them to more liquid instruments. And as we look at actual business activity and how we're doing, we'd focus you back within the segment. And as we talked about within the consumer business where average loans were up a little bit linked quarter on a card basis where we saw very strong continued growth within the home equity space, go back to the wealth management area where loans reached a record level. And then I think we've already addressed the work that we need to do on the commercial front.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Sure, sure. And maybe if you could, is it possible to give us an idea about the run-off portfolio, what's left in that at this stage and what your guys\u2019 expectations are for like a run-off headwind just so we can think about it for modeling purposes?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Sure. I think I would look at as you go forward given that we're not buying home loans from third-parties that you\u2019re probably looking at a high single-digit continued reduction for the next couple of quarters with respect to home loans that we hold for others. The second thing I'd say that you have is you've got roughly $3 billion a quarter in home equity pay-offs, a portion of which will be mitigated by new originations, but you are looking at roughly three there. And then you have some other kind of less than a billion dollar type items.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">But I think it's fair to say that as you go forward outside of what we think is core, you\u2019re probably looking at in the consumer businesses in the zip code of $10 billion to $12 billion that will go away and we\u2019ll either have the ability to reinvest and make new loans or otherwise reinvest.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay. And that's on a quarterly headwind basis?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay, terrific. And then thinking about wealth management, could you breakdown the expansion in the margins there this quarter? How much of it came from reduced spending? I know you guys have been investing there and so maybe could you help us understand how much of a contributing factor that was here this quarter and how much investment is left to wind down here?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I'm sorry, when you reference margin, margin in what area?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Sorry, wealth management and pre-tax?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Yes. If you look at it and you go through the different areas, you tend to have 40% type payouts with respect to the revenue piece. So when you look at the margin improvement of a couple of 100 basis points, I would put it more in the context of just good core expense management. I do think there was a little bit less litigation within the quarter that benefited us. But it tends to be just across the board, whether it be a little bit lower support cost, a little bit lower licensing fee number or a little bit less litigation. There was no one number that was particularly dominated in driving the margin.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And last quarter, we had some start up cost for the Merrill one product that you can see has had strong success in terms of that AUM. So that was sort of in the second quarter and now those expenses have to roll that out that comes back after.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yes. So that technology spent also rolled off too, which probably helped, right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Exactly. If you remember last quarter we talked about it they had a decline it was because some of the stuff was going in, in this quarter you saw it revert back to more where they have pretty consistently been over the last many quarters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Cool, cool. All right, I seem to remember that being somewhere in the ballpark of like $50 million to $100 million is that right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I think it was all in that much, but whether it was all in that one quarter or not, I don\u2019t remember.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay. So the decline from that might be less so?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Cool. And then last one, I know you guys have talked about here the repositioning that you guys want to take as far as AOCI risk and such. When we think about the AOCI hit that you guys lay out versus other money centers in the interest rate shock, it\u2019s a little bit higher than where some of the other folks are. And so hoping to maybe get a little bit of color on where the current duration is, where you expect the duration to go based upon the actions that you take. And then maybe help us also square the circle of understanding the larger AOCI hit and whether that\u2019s a result of a barbelling with the portfolio or what?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Sure. First, I just want to clear up that there is in the quarter, the only comment with respect to the quarter we\u2019re referencing is just to caution on the buy ticket given where interest rates are at this point during the quarter. I think if you go back and you look at over the last couple of quarters, it\u2019s been a very consistent message and that we\u2019ve said that we\u2019re going to direct more of the buy ticket to shorter date and treasury. And you can see that there has been a buildup of those treasuries over the course of the last three to four quarters. So, this quarter was a continuation to that and we were just calling out a note of caution given the rate environment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I think as it relates to overall OCI sensitivity, if you look at what we\u2019ve typically said is in 100 basis points parallel move up in rates, how long does it take back or take to earn back that OCI, we\u2019ve said consistently it\u2019s been around three years, it peaked at about three and half years and at the end of September it would have been less than three years. So we have kind of on a consistent trend line continued to look to move down the overall OCI risk as it presents itself to capital.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay. So is it right then to assume that duration on the AFS portfolio is a little under three years or is that not a correct interest?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">No that's the period of time that it takes to earn it back. You're looking at the overall -- I think the overall duration is going to be in the plus five years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay, thanks a lot.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And we'll go next to with Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Ken Usdin - Jefferies</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Hi, thanks. Just a question just on the trading business, obviously you guys and the other companies did well amidst the volatility in September. And I\u2019m just wondering with regard to the balance sheet changes you guys have been making and the optimization of RWAs and given what\u2019s happening in the environment right now, any changes in terms of how Tom\u2019s running that business as far as being able to capture the revenue opportunity out there, or any inhibition given by your views around risk taking and these capital balance sheet changes that you guys have talked about today?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I\u2019d refer you to page 21 in the appendix in the lower left hand corner. And you can see this is the third quarter \u201812, \u201813 and \u201814 laid out side-by-side. And so I don't think this is a change in position and if you look at the average trading weighted assets of 460 to 440, the bars 55 million and 56 million, 50 million and you can see the revenue. So we've probably done a good job of building a relatively stable -- business is going to fluctuate in the market but a relatively stable core amount of activity comes through this.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And if you look at it over several quarters with the exception of seasonality in the first quarter that typically occurs each year but we\u2019ve laid this out for you second quarter throughout \u201813, \u201814 last quarter and third quarter. You see it's a relatively consistent $3 billion revenue type of number and we've maintain that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">So adjustments we've made in the business on expenses, the scope of activities and stuff we actually made in \u201810 and \u201811 to bring that business inline. So we're very comfortable where they are now. They are always moving around impairing risks and continue to manage carefully the overall returns of the business. Its relative size to our company, we think we got in a good place, we simplified it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And so there is no change in strategy here. And in fact you can see there is a fairly consistent results from that activity. What's different this quarter versus last quarter obviously without the UK taxing you're seeing the bottom-line comes through the third quarter. But we've made $700 million after-tax and that's a good performance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Ken Usdin - Jefferies</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Thanks, Brian. And to follow just on the mortgage business, the servicing line has continued to just trickle out. I'm just wondering have we seen the bottoming of the former sales and the related revenues moving away from that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I think if you look at the servicing revenue, as I said, the biggest reason for the decline was an adjustment in the cost to serve. If you saw the actual servicing fee line that came through linked quarter it was only down about $25 million on a linked quarter basis. And so what you're going to see on a go forward basis is not so much the impact on the sale of MSRs, but just the servicing revenue that's derived based on the size of the MSR assets. So given that there aren\u2019t any more large scale sales of that MSR, you're going to see that more very on a core basis as opposed to a step function.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Ken Usdin - Jefferies</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And the pre-tax?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">What we'll see is that the number 60 plus delinquents continues to normalize now, we have to continue to push that that's where we think that we\u2019re going to get the additional expense leverage in LAS going forward. And so it's $100 million this quarter and couple of $100 million. It\u2019s just grinding through and working those loans for the customers and modifying or short selling and going through foreclosure.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">So that number is still elevated as a percentage, you can see it. And if you look at our delinquency off of the things we produced really since after the crisis, the numbers are much smaller and imply delinquency level ultimately half that amount that you see now. So that's where the real work will come in unit reduction. The overall 3.9 million units is fluctuating around a little bit, but we're kind of getting to equilibrium where our production is nearly what runs off had some sales and the 60 plus bucket.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Ken Usdin - Jefferies</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And my last follow-up just on that point, you had talked about $1.1 billion by 1Q 2015. You had previously talked about getting it down to about $500 million a year out from that. Is that still a reasonable expectation given that backdrop you just laid out?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">The first thing that we're focused on is getting it done through a billion one and then longer term, I think if you look at any metric with where we would see from a number of loan service, as well as the number of delinquent loans in the portfolio. We still have some significant work to do to drive billion one down, because given the size of the portfolio it's way too high.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Ken Usdin - Jefferies</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Okay. Thanks guys.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">And we'll go next to Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Yes, I just wanted to follow up on that. You talk about 60 day delinquent loans down 42,000 to 221,000. I don't think there is any sale of that. Is that just working through the portfolio and that seems like a very high pace? Can we expect that type of pace or what type of pace of loans do you think you can work out on a quarterly or annualized basis?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Yes. There were some servicing transfers during the quarter. My recollection is that was between 20,000 and 25,000 units that were actually transferred during the quarter. So it was a very good quarter for us as far as MSR sales and driving that number down. But I think you\u2019re right that on a go forward basis it\u2019s not going to be at that level, although we do think we\u2019ll make some significant progress between now and the end of \u201815.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Outside of the servicing trends, it was 20,000 to 25,000, so it was down roughly about 15,000 give or take, give or take 1,000 loans. Is that a pace that we could model going forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">There are obviously a lot of factors that can go into that that are going to happen, but I don\u2019t think -- if you believe that with what we\u2019re saying from the quality of the portfolio and you believe the foreclosure process continues along the same trends. You\u2019re probably looking at plus minus 20,000 units a quarter on an organic basis on a net basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Okay. And then relative to the big Department of Justice settlement, where do you think you are on legal costs? I know it's hard to sit there and say, but we've seen a couple other competitors get the Department of Justice behind them, but there still tends to be this nagging $1 billion here and there in legal costs that just won't go away. Where do you think we are -- is Bank of America, since they've paid probably the most out than anybody, are you more through that than most other people?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Well, Some of that stuff that people experience are pieces that we have already taken care of in prior quarters and some of it relates to completely different \u2013 as it relates to mortgage matters, some relates to other matters. We will always have litigation expense in this company. But in terms of the mortgage, we have talked to you in many quarters, but if you think just last three quarters three major pieces still behind and we\u2019re still waiting for the ultimate approval of the Gibbs &amp; Bruns settlement, 95% of the RMBS by principal amount. We had settlements and settlements at this point are awaiting final approval. So yes, a lot of pieces we have settled up FHA and things like that along the way.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">So, we\u2019ve got in the monolines, four out of the five are settled. So, we've been picking a way. And so without knowing all the ins and outs of the other competitors, from our standpoint, a lot of the smaller stuff was getting done as a lot of you focused on largest things, a lot of the smaller stuff is coming in and out every quarter underneath that and we should see less of that going forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Okay. Hey guys, thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">And we'll go next to Matthew Burnell with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Hey Matt.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Matthew Burnell - Wells Fargo</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Hi Brian, thanks for taking my question. I guess just a question in terms of the investment banking product rankings on page 32. Obviously most of the numbers are in the top three, particularly in the more important categories. I guess just looking at the global rankings in terms of some of the numbers that aren\u2019t in the top three, are there further investments you all plan to make in that business that would have any effect on the operating expense ratios in Global Banking or is that pretty much steady state in terms of the investments you all are putting into those businesses?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">I think as a broad construct and I think you're asking the more strategic level. Christian Meissner and the team with Tom have done good job of adding people in the markets where we needed to build our capabilities and we\u2019re always looking to add more and more talent, more and more capabilities. I don't think there is any huge change in expenses or numbers. It's more of a continuously upgrading our talent and adding incremental talent. But in the grand scheme of things, it's a pretty small expense base in the context for our company with the level of expenses. But your point is exactly right. The global, the U.S. competitors, our franchise is obviously demonstrably stronger as you can see in the U.S. rankings versus the global. The global bas picked up honestly. And as activity picks up in Europe and Asia, we continue to drive forward. But we still are working hard to improve our positioning in it across the board but we\u2019ve made a lot of investments already.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Matthew Burnell - Wells Fargo</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">And then if I could just ask a follow-up on the commercial -- non-U.S. commercial loans, couple of competitors have mentioned that there has been some weakness in trade finance lending. And I am just curious how much if any that has affected the loan growth within the non-U.S. commercial side of the balance sheet?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">It has affected us in two ways. So when you look at the decline that we saw within the loans outside of the U.S., a chunk of that decline was a decline in trade finance. So I think what's also notable is the trade finance test to have the lowest spreads. So when you look at the yields within the international loan portfolio, they\u2019re up. And that's because you've got more corporate type loans that have higher spreads than trade finance which tends to have lower spreads.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Matthew Burnell - Wells Fargo</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Thanks very much, Bruce.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">And we'll go next to Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Mine were asked and answered. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Thanks Chris.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">And we'll go next to Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Steven Chubak - Nomura</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Hi, good morning. Bruce, the first question regards capital and profitability targets. I know at a recent investor conference, you alluded to the fact that you believe that CCAR currently represents the binding capital constrain for the bank which is just that presumably you'll need to manage to a higher core Tier 1, which I guess from my perspective could put at risk the 14% [ROTE] goal that you guys had established in the early part of this year. And I suppose it's really a two-part. First, what core Tier 1 target do you believe you'll need to manage over the cycle and then as a follow-up to that, how does that inform your outlook for meeting that goal?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Sure. Well, a couple of things. I go back to the first comment, which is that you have to break out a little bit what\u2019s going to happen for our company over the next five quarters between the growth in tangible common equity versus the growth in regulatory capital that flows into the capital ratio, because as I said before, over the next five quarters, we'll accrete capital on a pre-tax basis absent any other changes. But it\u2019s the first thing I keep in mind.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">The second thing is that as we look out we do believe at this point that CCAR is the governor and we\u2019re obviously getting ready to go into the 2015 CCAR process and without instructions or any assumptions or scenarios that I think it's premature to look at that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">The third thing is you look at return targets and Mike touched on this a little bit in his earlier question. I think the thing that as we look to get into those 12%, 14% type targets, the thing I would encourage you to do, because I do think that you start to get a bridge to that is if you take the earnings that we announced today in normalize and for the things that I touched on in my comments, you tend to be starting at a point that's in the 10% plus type return during the quarter from a tangible common equity perspective. And you've got really four things that are going to change that on a go forward basis. The continued reduction within our LAS expenses, we would expect obviously longer term litigation expenses to go down. You have the benefit of rate. And then you've got what we do within the core businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">So those are the four things that we're focused on. And the last point I would say is it relates to just CCAR, we feel like getting ready for CCAR during this quarter and quite frankly throughout the year that we've made a lot of work between moving out of the company, those assets that tend to have low or high loss contents. In stress, we\u2019ve augmented our CET1 ratios as we\u2019ve gone forward. And we think we\u2019ve taken a lot of tail risk out.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">So long-winded way of saying you can kind of look at the bridge to more normalized returns when you adjust what we saw this quarter. We feel very good about the progress that we\u2019ve made as we prepare for CCAR. We\u2019ll look to see what the instructions are and we\u2019ll have to see if our assumption about that being the governor given the evolving regulatory landscape continues to be the case or if we need to update that assessment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Steven Chubak - Nomura</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">All right. Thanks for that, Bruce. That's really helpful. And then just switching gears to the liquidity side of the equation, one measure which hasn't garnered very much attention is the net stable funding ratio. And my understanding is that Basel's at least intended goal was to have the NSFR calibration completed by the end of this year. And I was hoping you could disclose where you currently stand on this metric?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">So we do not have an exact number to disclose at this point. What I would say is we worked through and we\u2019ve done the work to get to where we needed to be from an LCR perspective that at this point there is not anything that gives us any concern that we\u2019re going to have to change it any material way and what we\u2019re doing to satisfy NSFR.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Steven Chubak - Nomura</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">All right, thanks. And maybe just one more quick modeling question. I was hoping you could clarify given all the preferred issuance that's been done, assuming nothing incremental is completed going forward in terms of issuance, what the preferred coupon should be on an annualized basis next year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">I\u2019ve got an exact number for you. Bear with me one second. You should see during next year a preferred number of 1262.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Steven Chubak - Nomura</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">All right, perfect. That's it for me. Thanks for taking my questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">And there are no further questions at this time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Thank you everyone. Look forward to seeing you next quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">This does conclude today's conference.

And welcome to the Bank of America Earnings Announcement Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode, but later you\u2019ll have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Please note this call is being recorded. It\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. Lee McEntire. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Lee McEntire</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning, thanks to everybody on the phone, as well as the webcast for joining us this morning for the fourth quarter results. Hopefully you guys have had a chance to review the earnings release documents available on the Web site. Before I turn the call over to Brian and Bruce, let me just remind you, we may make forward-looking statements. For further information on those, please refer to either our earnings release documents, our Web site or our other SEC filings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">So with that, let me turn it over to Brian Moynihan, our CEO for some opening comments, before Bruce Thompson the CFO goes through the details. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Brian Moynihan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you, Lee and good morning and thank all of you for joining us to review our fourth quarter results for 2014. As we think about the year, we\u2019ve accomplished a lot, including resolving many significant legacy issues that were overshadowing the underlying progress in our financials. Solving these issues obviously came at a cost and drove a decline in year-over-year net income. But importantly it settles through the uncertainty for all of us, for investors, regulators, rating agencies and others, allowed us to focus on the core business and operation of the company going forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">As we move to Slide 2, you could see that we have a simplified and stronger company. Today we reported earnings of $3.1 billion after tax. The company is simpler and more straightforward with improved risk profile. Everything we do now is focused on driving the company forward and delivering for our customers and clients. On this slide you can see some of the important results, this year we completed probably the industry\u2019s largest ever cost savings program which achieved $8 billion of annualized savings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Let\u2019s think about that, we started that program in 2011 when we had around 290,000 FTE and over the last three years since then driving it the right way we completed 2014 ending the year with around 220,000 FTEs. Non-interest expense excluding litigation declined 4.4 billion compared from 2013 to 2014 and is down more than $8 billion the last couple of years, and yet we have more work to do ahead of us. We further strengthened an already strong liquid balance sheet and increased our common stock dividend during 2014 for the first time since 2007. As you can see on this page, our credit costs are at a decade low level.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">So, notwithstanding the headwinds our industry faces with rates on an ongoing global economic sluggishness, we\u2019ve built a platform for growth, especially in the context of continuous improving of U.S. economy. We have built a company with leading market positions across every core customer base. And our task now is, continue to build on that foundation and the progress we\u2019ve made. As you look at our results, you\u2019d see that year-over-year earnings in our primary businesses with exceptions with the consumer real-estate business made progress that shows stability in a volatile rate geopolitical environment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Importantly as you think about our company, we have been investing growth, while taking out expense. We reduced our overall headcount during 2014 by around 8% but at the same time we invested. We invested by reallocating resources to sales capacity from those savings, increasing in all our core businesses. We invested by reallocating expense reductions to product capabilities and both capabilities our cash management capabilities and other capabilities around the world. We\u2019ve invested some of the savings in our technology, spending over $3 billion in 2014 to improve and protect our company.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Now you can see the results in the appendix pages and Bruce will touch on them in the line of business presentations. We expect to continue this effort going forward. We have teams working on it every day. They are working to be allocating non-productive expense to drive towards growth. The line management obtained a good expense management come to expect from our company. At the same time we are laser focused on money market sharing growth with our customers the economy continues to improve and we look forward to reporting that progress during the year ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">With that I\u2019ll turn it over to Bruce to take you through the quarter\u2019s numbers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><strong>Bruce Thompson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Great. Thanks, Brian and good morning everyone. Let\u2019s start on Slide 3, and I am going to go through the details. During the fourth quarter, we recorded $3.1 billion of earnings or $0.25 per diluted share. Let me give you a few thoughts on revenues. There were two significant adjustments to revenue, as well as negative DVA charges that in the aggregate reduced reported revenues this quarter by $1.2 billion pretax or roughly $0.07 a share after tax. Of the components of the $1.2 billion impact, we recorded roughly $578 million negative market related adjustments which as you all know we refer to as FAS 91 and net interest income for the acceleration of bond premium amortization on our debt securities that was driven by lower long-term rates, otherwise our core net interest income which excludes this market related adjustment was pretty stable with the fourth quarter coming in a little bit better than we signaled to you all during our third quarter earnings call.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In addition, this quarter we adopted FVA which is for Funding Valuation Adjustment and incurred a $497 million charge against our sales and trading results as a result of that adoption. And as we normally provide to you a credit spreads tightened and this tightening caused the negative charge for DVA in the trading account of approximately $130 million during the quarter. Expenses during the quarter were well managed. Our total non-interest expense in the fourth quarter was $14.2 billion which included approximately $400 million in litigation expense during the quarter. This level of expense is the lowest level of expense that we\u2019ve seen since the Merrill Lynch merger. And credit cost during the quarter improved as our provision for credit losses was $219 million and included 660 million in the release of reserves.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">On Slide 4, reduced asset levels in our global markets business drove our balance sheet levels lower, coming down $19 billion from the third quarter of '14 and we finished at just over 2.1 trillion in assets. We continued our focus on balance sheet optimization for liquidity, as we continue to shift our discretionary portfolio into HQLA eligible securities from non-HQLA loans and also improved our deposit composition. As we have signaled to you in the third quarter earnings call, discretionary portfolio first lien loans declined from the third quarter of '14 levels, but we were very pleased with the loan growth we saw in our core businesses during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">If we look in those core businesses, global banking loans increased $4 billion during the quarter. Within wealth management loan balances grew $3 billion. And our U.S. consumer credit card receivables increased $2.9 billion during the quarter. We did have a $2.7 billion decline in our direct and indirect portfolio as we transferred a portfolio of student loans to held-for-sale. Our deposits grew from the end of the third quarter while short-term funding declined. We executed another successful issuance of 1.4 billion of preferred stock early in the third quarter and that benefited regulatory capital.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Shareholders\u2019 equity improved with both the earnings growth as well as the improvements in AOCI. As a result of that our tangible book value increased to $14.43 per share and our tangible common equity ratio improved to 7.47%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We move to regulatory capital on Slide 5, under the transition rules, our CET1 ratio was 12.3%, we look at our Basel III regulatory capital metrics on a fully phased-in basis, CET1 capital improved $6.2 billion during the quarter that was driven by earnings, deferred tax utilization as well as the improvement in AOCI. Our operational risk weighted assets during the quarter increased again, they now represent 34% of total risk weighted assets but not withstanding that increase we were able to keep our Basel III advance ratio at level of consistence with what we saw at the end of third quarter. Under the standardized approach, our CET1 ratio improved from 9.5% in the third quarter of '14 to 10% at the end of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We look at our supplementary leverage ratios. We\u2019ve done a lot of work over the past year to improve those, obviously the fully phased-in kick-in in 2018. We look at where we ended the quarter, in our bank holding company our SLR ratio was a 5.9% and primary banking subsidiary BANA we were at approximately 7%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We turn to Slide 6, funding and liquidity, long-term debt ended the quarter at 243 billion, down 7 billion from the third quarter of '14. We have done a lot of work over the past couple of years to smooth out our parent company maturity profile and as you can see we have $22 billion scheduled to mature in 2015 and comparable amounts over the next 4 to 5 years. Our global excess liquidity sources reached a record level during the quarter and closed at $439 billion and within those global excess liquidity sources our parent company liquidity improved 5 billion from the end of the third quarter to $98 billion at the end of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Time to required funding increased to 39 months during the fourth quarter and during the quarter if we continued to increase our estimated liquidity coverage ratios at both the consolidated as well as at the bank levels. At the end of the year we\u2019re well ahead of the 100% fully phased-in 2017 requirements at the consolidated level and at more than 90% at the bank level, which is well ahead of the 80% phased-in 2015 requirement and are well positioned to achieve the 2017 requirement.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We turn to Slide 7 on net interest income, our net interest income on an FTE basis was $9.9 billion down from the third quarter of '14 as a result of the more negative market related adjustment I mentioned a moment ago, which also drove a reported net interest yield decline of 11 basis points. Lower long-term rates coupled with the flattened yield curves resulted in adjustments to our assumptions to our bond premium amortizations, which drove the $578 million of market related adjustments in the fourth quarter versus the negative $55 million we saw during the third quarter of '14. We adjust this market related adjustment NII was $10.4 billion and declined less than $100 million from the third quarter of '14 despite the challenging rate environment we saw during the fourth quarter. The adjusted NII decline was driven by the impacts of the lower discretionary loan balances within the consumer real estate portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">If we look at net interest yield on an adjusted basis it was up a touch from the third quarter of 2014 to 2.3%. Given the movement lowering rates that we saw during the quarter, we did become more asset-sensitive touched at 100 basis point parallel increase in rates from what we saw at the end of the year we\u2019d be expected to contribute roughly $3.7 billion in NII benefits over the course of the next 12 months. And given the boom in rates the sensitivity is now more evenly weighted to both long-term, as well as short-term rate moves. Before we leave this slide I do want to remind you that during the first quarter of '15 we have two fewer interest accrual days than the fourth quarter of '14 which will negatively impact NII by a couple of $100 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Non-interest expense and then moving to Slide 8 was 14.2 billion in the fourth quarter of '14 and included approximately $400 million in litigation expense. As I said earlier, this is the lowest quarterly expense amount that we have reported since the Merrill Lynch merger. We exclude litigation, total expenses were 13.8 billion which declined 300 million from the third quarter of '14 and was driven by our LAS initiative cost savings, as well as lower revenue related incentive costs within our global markets business. We compare these expenses to the fourth quarter of 2013, we were down $1.2 billion driven by LAS cost savings, new BAC benefits and to a lesser degree the lower revenue related incentives.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Legacy assets and servicing costs ex-litigation were 1.1 billion in the quarter, 200 million lower than the third quarter and 700 million lower than the fourth quarter of 2013. As we continue to work through these delinquent loans, we expect these quarterly costs will come down a few $100 million more by the end of 2015. Headcount was down 5,800 during the quarter and as we look at expense a reminder, that we will record our normal annual retirement eligible incentive cost in the first quarter of 2015 and we expect that number to be roughly $1 billion consistent with what we\u2019ve seen in the past couple of years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We turn to asset quality on Slide 9, that quality continue to improve during the quarter Q4 provision expense was $219 million and we relived the net 660 million of reserves given the continued pace of asset quality improvement particularly within our consumer real estate portfolio. Reported charge-offs were 879 million and declined from the third quarter of 2014. I would remind you both periods of net charge-offs included NPL sales and not their recoveries and the fourth quarter included approximately 150 million of cost related to actions that were taking in relation to our DOJ settlement which we\u2019re previously reserved for. If we exclude the recoveries in the DOJ component charge-offs in the fourth quarter were just over $1 billion versus a similarly adjusted net charge-off amount of 1.2 billion in the third quarter of '14. Loss rate on the same adjusted basis were 47 basis points in the fourth quarter of '14 versus 52 basis points that we saw in the third quarter of '14.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Let\u2019s now move to the business segment results which we start on Slide 10 with consumer and business banking. Our results within consumer and business banking shows solid bottom-line performance with earnings of $1.8 billion, those were down from the fourth quarter of '13 due largely to lower release of loan loss reserves and to a lesser degree higher tax rates. Business generated a solid 24% return on allocated capital during the quarter. Revenue was up slightly on a year-over-year basis despite net interest income being down as our non-interest income grew more than 5% with a strong improvement in card income.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We look at customer activity during the quarter, we had solid deposit growth and our rates paid is now at 5 basis points. Loans on a linked quarter basis increased seasonally, driven by U.S. consumer credit card, our card issuance remains very strong at 1.2 million new cards in the fourth quarter of '14 of which approximately 67% of those were issued to existing customers. We look at all of 2014, we issued 15% more cards in '14 than '13, and increased the percentage of the issuance to our existing customers which is consistent with the overall strategy. Credit quality improved again as our U.S. credit card loss rate fell to 2.7% and continues to have a very strong risk adjusted margin at just below 10%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Our Merrill Edge brokerage assets grew $114 billion which is up 18% year-over-year on new accounts, strong accounts flows as well as higher market levels. Our mobile banking customers reached 16.5 million in the fourth quarter and now 12% of all customer deposit transactions are done through mobile devices. We adjust for portfolio divestitures combined debit and credit purchase volume was up 4% relative to the fourth quarter of '13 and if we back fuel up it was up 5%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Move to consumer real estate services on the Slide 11, the improvement in the results compared to the third quarter of '14 was driven by the third quarter of '14 DOJ settlements which impacted expense, provision as well as income tax. Revenues did increase slightly over the third quarter of '14, while expense even after we exclude litigation declined from the third quarter as both the former cost on the production side and cost on the delinquent loan servicing side were down from the third quarter. Core production revenue and servicing fees were both stable compared to the third quarter of '14, while servicing income did benefit from better MSR hedging results. On the production front, first mortgage retail originations were stable with the third quarter of '14 at 11.6 billion and the pipeline was consistent with the third quarter of '14 as well, albeit up on a year-over-year basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On home equity, we\u2019re the number one lender in line originations during the quarter with 3.4 billion in line with the third quarter of '14 and up north of 70% on a year-over-year basis. The credit quality of those second-lien originations remains very strong with average cycle scores over 790 in combined loan-to-value ratios at less than 60%. Expenses in the segment did include 262 million if litigation cost in the fourth quarter versus 5.3 billion that we saw in the third quarter of '14. We continue to work through and resolve RMBS securities litigation matters including this quarter the FHLB of San Francisco matter. With the resolution of that we now estimate that we\u2019ve resolved approximately 98% of the unpaid principal balance of all RMBS as to which RMBS securities litigation has been filed or threatened against all Bank of America related entities. LAS expense ex-litigation this quarter was just over 1.1 billion, as we achieved our first quarter of 2015 goal a quarter ahead of schedule. Importantly, the number of 60 plus days delinquent loans that we have dropped to 189,000 units which is down 32,000 or 14% from the third quarter of 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We turn to Slide 12, global wealth and investment management delivered another strong quarter. Pre-tax was strong, net income was just over 700 million, but was down from the fourth quarter of '13 and solid fee-based growth was offset by lower net interest income and higher expense. Record asset management fees offsets the weakness we saw in transactional activity and still drove a 7% increase in non-interest revenue relative to the fourth quarter of '13. Our asset management fees now represents 45% of revenue within the segment up from 40% a year ago.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Non-interest expense did increase from the fourth quarter of '13 as a result of higher performance-based incentives, as well as increased support cost. We increased the number of financial advisors in year-to-date retention of our experienced financial advisors remains at record levels. Return on allocated capital was 23%. Client balances were nearly 2.5 trillion, up 36 billion from the third quarter of '14 and were driven by strong client balance inflows. Long-term AUM flows were $9 billion for the quarter and represented the 22nd consecutive quarter of positive flows. Our record loan flows during the quarter reflect 3 billion in growth over the third quarter of '14 in securities space as well as residential mortgage lending. And our period end deposits were up 7 billion or 3% from the third quarter of 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">If we turn to Slide 13, global banking earnings for the quarter were 1.4 billion, up from the fourth quarter of '13 on lower credit cost and to a lesser degree, reduced expenses. Results were partially -- the net income was partially offset during the quarter on a year-over-year basis by lower investment banking fees off of what was a record level in the fourth quarter of '13. Return on allocated capital was strong at 18%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We look at the investment banking revenues of north of $1.5 billion, we feel very good about the results, they were up on a linked quarter basis, and our investment banking team executed very well in a tough distribution environment given the volatility of rates as well as energy prices. Provision was a slight benefit in the quarter and reflected continued low loss rates in a small reserve release compared to the year ago period which included a reserve addition of $434 million. If we look at the balance sheet would point to two average loans, were 271 billion up 3.7 billion from the third quarter of 2014 levels.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">If we switch to global markets on Slide 14, the business reported a modest loss in the quarter but that did include a $497 million charge to implement FVA. For those unfamiliar with FVA, funding valuation adjustment is an adjustment to the fair value of uncollateralized derivative trades to account for the present value of funding cost. This is an accounting practice many of our peers have also adopted and as you all know this is a one-time transition cost for implementation. Separately net DVA for the quarter was a loss of 130 million versus a loss of 617 million during the fourth quarter of '13. Earnings are down from the fourth quarter of '13 as a result of a decline in sales and trading revenue that was mostly offset by decline in expense.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">If you recall on our fourth quarter '13 call fixed sales and trading during that quarter included 220 million in recoveries on legacy positions in the fourth quarter of '13. Sales and trading adjusting for net DVA and FVA were $2.4 billion in the fourth quarter of '14 versus 2.8 billion in the fourth quarter of '13 after we adjust for the recoveries. On the same adjustment basis fixed sales and trading revenues of $1.5 billion compare to $1.9 billion in the year ago period.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">December results were particularly challenging during the quarter with the toughest areas of performance being the credit sensitive businesses within FICC most notably mortgages and credit trading which are generally our largest trading revenue related businesses. On the positive side, we saw increases in both FX in rates revenues versus the prior year that were driven by increased volatility given global deflationary expectations leading to the U.S. dollar strengthening. Equity sales and trading was up modestly from the fourth quarter of '13 as increased volatility was a positive for secondary flows across both our cash and derivative trading businesses. On the expense front, the decline reflects litigation expense of 655 million in the fourth quarter of '13. If we take that litigation expense out, expenses still declined 5% from the fourth quarter of '13 as the incentives were reduced to align with the revenue performance that we saw.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On Slide 15, all other, the results in the fourth quarter of '13 reflect lower revenue from NII largely associated with the market related adjustments that we\u2019ve discussed, as well as lower securities gained and equity investment income partially offset by gains on the sale of certain loans with long-term standby agreements that were converted to securities. Significant equity investment income is largely a thing of the past for us as we\u2019ve reduced the size of the principle investing positions in the business, as well as strategic positions and should be modeled accordingly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">You\u2019ll also notice we took additional reserves to the payment protection insurance, but at a lower level than we saw during the third quarter of 2014. Our fourth quarter 2014 expense is down year-over-year on less non-mortgage litigation expense and lower infrastructure costs. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 29% and I would expect the tax rate for the company in 2015 to be in the low 30s absent any unusual items. One other thing I want to mention before wrapping up is some movement in our business lines that you\u2019ll see as we report them to you in 2015. In the first quarter of '15 we expect to align business banking into our global banking business which takes this more commercial business out of our core consumer and business banking unit. In addition, we expect to move the home loans portion of our consumer real estate services business to consumer banking as this product remains integral to their relationships with us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So, to conclude my comments as we look at both 2014 and the fourth quarter of '14, capital and liquidity reached record levels, which provides a solid base to support our businesses that hold leading or top-tier positions in the industry. We continue our focus on expense and operating leverage after reaching significant milestones this year on both new BAC, as well as LAS cost saving initiatives. We reported a quarter of much lower legacy assets and servicing, operating and litigation costs, which have been burdening our reported results. Asset quality continues its trend of improvement against the slowly improving U.S. macroeconomic backdrop and we continue to remain well positioned to benefit in an environment where rates starts to increase.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And with that we\u2019ll go ahead and open it up for questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Question-and</strong>-<strong>Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">(Operator Instructions) We could take our first question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">I just want to talk a little bit about the asset sensitivity and how we should be thinking about that from here in particular as long end of the curve has come down since the end of this quarter, so just wanted to understand is that FAS 91 effect to the day given what the long end of the curve has done? And then maybe just to speak to what you\u2019re doing to trying to minimize any further pressure?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">A couple of things, so if you follow us Betsy we\u2019ve historically have been saying that the 100 basis points is in the $3.1 billion to $3.2 billion range and think of the increase to 3.7 more or less just representing the recapturing of the FAS 91, that we saw this quarter and that\u2019s why we referenced that there has been more asset sensitivity on the long side, the short-end side really hasn\u2019t changed at all.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Sure and then given the fact that the tenure is now yielding like 1.8 or so, should we assume like if we end the quarter in 1Q at 1.8 that the same type of 10 basis points down drives FAS 91 effect it\u2019s the same in the first quarter as it was in the fourth quarter or is it because you\u2019re more asset sensitive there is a little bit higher impact?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">That\u2019s a good question I think when we looked at this last night that the movement that we\u2019ve seen in so far in the first quarter of '15 is almost identical to what we saw during the fourth quarter so if you were to snap it off of what we saw last night it would be a comparable type number realizing we stopped 2.5 months ago.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. And is there any give backs in refi activities that you\u2019re expecting?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Yes, it says here if we look at, we referenced if refi activity increased as a percentage of overall mortgage production in the fourth quarter and as I have said in my prepared remarks if we look at the pipelines and compare the mortgage pipeline at year-end relative to the comparable period, it\u2019s up pretty significantly and we\u2019ll just have to see how that plays out realizing that the first quarter does tend to be a little bit seasonally slow.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">The other thing Betsy is that it has been in January if HSN starts moving and the amount of applications coming in have fairly started the upward move due to this last refi so, as those things close through we\u2019d expect to see some pick up in production this quarter from the refi.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">We\u2019ll take our next question from John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. Go ahead please.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Hi Bruce, just wanted to follow-up on the NII, on the core side of NIIX ex the FAS 91 your core NII held up well despite what you had indicated in October about kind of being conservative with the buy ticket. I guess how does you kind of hold the core end on NII and how are you navigating that now and what feels like a even more difficult environment for kind of reinvesting cash flows today with the tenure where it is?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Sure, that\u2019s a good question John, there are a couple of things, the first is if you look at the quarter I think we did a good job with respect to the overall debt footprint which was down $7 billion which helped us out a little bit. Secondly, if you look at we were able to get another basis point out on the deposit front and throughout the quarter we saw some loan growth that was a little bit better than what we would have seen when we spoke to you during the quarter. The other thing that we did see during the quarter is we were able to invest and get some of the investments in the portfolio and I believe it was a mid-November when rates did back up and as we go forward we do have liquidity to invest in the second and third months of the quarter and we\u2019ll be prudent with how we invest it relative to OCI risk. The other thing I would say just before we leave this John that I should have referenced with Betsy\u2019s point is that, it\u2019s easy to focus on the FAS 91 because we resetting the amortization of premium, and the other thing you need to realize is that we did see in the quarter is with the rate movement up while you do have a negative on FAS 91 you\u2019ve got a significant positive from a capital perspective where OCI in the quarter from the rate movement was north of $3 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So on the core piece Bruce, do you expect to be more challenging to kind of hold in to that 104 with the tenure where it is, does it make it more difficult and how should we think about the rest of the 104 if rates stay low?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Well I think as I said in my comments the 104 you really need to start out at about 102 because you\u2019ve got two less days during the quarter. And I\u2019d say that there is a little bit of headwind to hold that on a core basis and we\u2019re obviously doing everything we can to keep it as close to 102 as we can, realizing that we\u2019re not going to take outsized OCI risk.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. And then shipping gears on expenses you got the LAS target a quarter at a time, do you have a year-end target I think you said you expect to continue to reduce the LAS to 1.1, could you just clarify that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I think as we look out and we look at the plans and actions along with the progress that we\u2019ve made on the 60 plus day delinquency I think broadly speaking as you know this number can bounce around a little bit but we\u2019d look to have the LAS expenses down to the $800 million type area by the end of the year and we\u2019re obviously working through plans as we look out to 2016 to continue to drive that number south of 800 million as we go forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. And how should we think about kind of core rest of Bank of America expenses where you came in nicely at the 127 for the fourth quarter obviously you mentioned the stock option expense stuff in the first quarter, but as we think about 2015 what are you hoping to do on the core expense space?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">John I think it probably is sort of about a broad level and Bruce can touch in, so if you think about in the fourth quarter a couple of things happened, one is, you have to remember margins for the investment was down so be careful not to forget as we see it coming back this quarter and expect it to rise as it just did in the first quarter that would be a increased expense which you should want obviously. And the rest of it is basically a continuous process of taking out expenses and bringing the bottom-line of reinvest growth so to give you a straightforward way in the fourth quarter the reduction headcount of approximately 5,000, and 1,100 or so was LAS and the rest was core activity we will just be growing down expense base at the same time we have added sales people during that quarter. So what we\u2019re trying to do is ideally we wouldn\u2019t expect it to fall dramatically, but I\u2019d expect you guys to be able to see us continuing to make strong investments in sales capacity, technology, products while holding expenses relatively flat with a slight down or biased irrespective of you just got to be careful of the compensation related to revenue because we don\u2019t want that to be higher.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And our next question will come from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So in FICC it seems a little bit below what certainly what I was looking for and I know you highlighted some of the difficult markets that you\u2019re large in, was there any specific positional pain given what we saw in some of the credit spreads and some of the movements there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">No, not at all, just to go back to the core premise that we talk about which is that the banking and markets businesses are run as an integrated business and a lot of the activity that we see within the markets area is in market making and other things that are done off of the new issue platform from an underwriting perspective and I think what we saw during the quarter particularly in December was that there was a significant slowdown as we saw overall volatility in the markets from both a new issue, as well as a secondary market perspective that flow through but there were not any, if you look here there were no losses or particular pain points within the global markets piece of the equation during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And then can you guys add any comment to the press reports we have seen about you\u2019re rationalizing the PB business and cutting ties to 150(h)(1) class?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Well, I think this is a customer profitability exercise. As we look at driving the franchise Tom and Syed Mateen have done a good job repositioning the equities business. We had the constrain of prime brokerage a bit due to size, because of the flow of balance sheet return as you\u2019d be aware of, but importantly it\u2019s the customer profitability we are looking for customers who will use this with multiple products and services what is fixed income equities all that there is a fixed income and so as we take this cash resource which is the GAAP balance sheet and the RWA balance sheet and allocate it across customers we\u2019ve got extra rate returns and this was the natural question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Should we expect to think about some revenue headwinds in your equities business as we model out 2015, as a result of some of those efforts?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">No it\u2019s all pretty much through it right now and as you look at the revenue sort of quarter-to-quarter run plus or minus $1 billion and Syed Mateen has done a good job of increasing the yields from the other clients at the same time. So that I would, absent market forces are just I wouldn\u2019t expect that much an effect.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Then helpful to hear about the target of around $800 million for LAS by year-end and then driving it lower in 2016. Can you help us think about how you think about that number to zero? Because I mean, ultimately, that's -- given the title, the L in the LAS, right? That's got to go to zero eventually. How should we think about that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Well we have got several and in there and so there is all the servicing expense in the company is in that unit well good loans and bad loans, so it doesn\u2019t go to zero but it\u2019s got to get a lot better at this. If you start to move on to 4 million or so units we have in first mortgage servicing and think about the annualized cost we have got to get us down significantly may be servicing and mortgages make sense to us and so, but that\u2019s a project that we\u2019re working against doing it the right way for the customer, doing it the right way for the regulatory environment and the consent orders and all the things that have gone on as you are aware and so we just got to keep feeling out a way. So when we say 800 or so that is the next way station on our train right here, but it\u2019s got to go a lot further than that for the 3.5 million to 4 million the good units we have so to speak.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. So no indication about where that settling-out level might ultimately be even if not a win, but kind of what the number would be?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Well, I think the Bruce talked about a half billion but I am not sure that\u2019s a great performance not overtime either. So just assume that there is nothing more interesting than driving that number down to a normalized servicing cost than this company.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And then last one for me, you guys hit on in the wealth management business and the margin there support cost and revenue related comp, could you maybe quantify how much each of those factors impacted the margin change quarter-over-quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes I think if you look at the a couple of things, the first is that from a margin perspective you had a little bit of headwind with NII being lower than what it was, but I would -- as you look at the support cost during the quarter I would think about is being about 200 basis points on the margin during the quarter that we saw.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Our next question will come from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I wonder if we could get your best comment that you can give us on energy-related exposures. In your Q you have a general comment on energy and $20 billion. But if you could break it down a little bit more, what's secured, what's not secured, what's investment grade, what's not, and just how overall you feel your position there -- it would be helpful?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I think if we look at the amount of funded exposure across what we referred to as oil and gas, the amount of funded exposure which includes derivative exposure was roughly $23 billion at the end of the year. As you look at that 23 billion, I would think of it generally as 60% that\u2019s directly reflected or affected by the price of oil, there are a lot of those that have not so you have got roughly $22 billion, $23 billion funded 60% directly affected by oil well north of 80% of that are investment grade borrowers and for those non-investment grade borrowers there are obviously secured facilities and in most cases have formulas upon which they can borrow based on the value of the assets that were secured by.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I think if you think overall and one of the things that to give a perspective that we see is in the consumer spending in January on debit and credit cards basically, we\u2019ve seen the spend go up by 3% and if you look at these fuel side of that it\u2019s about 5% of that total spending and it is down 28% year-over-year. So the people are getting a benefit that our consumer customers are getting benefit but the re-spending that benefit and overall thing those are growing through it. So, they are competing -- there is a technical risk for the oil producing companies that Bruce have talked you through, but the overall economy even the first week or so January we\u2019re seeing the benefit of the consumer very historically when the year-over-year compares.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I definitely appreciate all that. You said that was the funded to oil and gas, is commitments a larger number, I think, than that? And do you have the ability to pull back on the commitments?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Well I think on average the fundings are roughly 50% of what the commitments are, as it relates to the pulling back of commitments I think what I would point to and what our teams did a very good job with is we obviously have commitments in the originate to distribute piece which if we look at we ended the year I believe with two commitments of investment grade borrowers on an originate and distribute basis one of which has had a significant positive event from a financing perspective already this year, the others are single A credit that will get done in the second quarter and at outside of the investment grade originate to distribute. I think there was a couple 100 million dollars that still needed to get done. So you\u2019re not pulling commitments from borrowers but as it relates to commitments that needed to be distributed the teams have done a very good job.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. I don't want to put words in your mouth, but it sounds like you are semi-comfortable with the positioning. There will be some hits along the way, but this is not a major risk to the portfolio? Again, I don't want to put words in your mouth?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">We\u2019re comfortable with the positions, you should assume as we\u2019re making these commitments in environments where oil is higher, we\u2019re continually running and stressing those portfolios to be comfortable with the commitments. And as Brian referenced to the extent that that were in a prolonged period, where these prices persist to the extent that there are cost that run through because of difficulties that a commercial or corporate borrower may have that as we look across the overall credit platform, you\u2019d expect there to be offsets given what we\u2019re seeing with consumers and other people that are benefiting from lower energy prices.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay, that's helpful. Last one from me is I didn't hear anything on TLAC. If you could tell us where you think your ratio shook out, net of the conservation buffer and the SIFI buffer, that would be helpful?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes I think if you look at where we are from a TLAC perspective we\u2019re generally in the 21% type area and embedded in that 21% type area is the fact that that structured note we\u2019ve assumed for that purpose that we would not benefit from structured note funding and if we refinance out those structured note to pick up another 1% to 2% based on the current size of that footprint.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. I just want to make sure: the 21% is net of the conservation buffer and your SIFI buffer, or gross of?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">No it\u2019s gross up, that\u2019s a gross up. So it\u2019s a roughly 21 call it plus, another 1 to 2 for structured notes and then depending on the exact treatment of the buffers as we go through that number would be reduced by the buffers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Our next question will come from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Just a quick question on the balance sheet and NII, I appreciate the efforts to keep NIM flat; but to really get NII growing, we've got to start to see, I guess, the balance sheet on a net basis grow. I think your balance sheet was down close to $25 billion this quarter. At what point do we start to see the net balance sheet -- the restructuring of the balance sheet start to give way to growth?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I think what you didn\u2019t see there as we go forward is that we look out into our forecast and models, we would expect there to continue to be strong deposit growth throughout 2015 and as we referenced before obviously the goal with that deposit growth is very much a focus to grow loans within our core customer segments. And as I referenced we saw that within the global banking space this quarter, we saw it within wealth management, we\u2019re seeing pickups in overall mortgage activity. So I think you are likely to see the balance sheet creep up as deposits come in and as we look to grow loans, I just want to make sure though that we remind you that we will continue to see these discretionary portfolio that\u2019s got whole loans in it that in this rate environment they will continue to repay, so you judge how we do on loan growth you need to look at the core businesses. As I said we would expect to start to see the balance sheet move up and at the same time we\u2019re trying to get things that don\u2019t have a return and our quarter what we do off but to your point I think we\u2019re largely through that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And I think if you think about it say two years ago I think we sighted about 100 odd billion dollars of non-core loans that\u2019s done under 30, and a dominant part of that is still in the home equity area quite frankly. So in the card business and the business banking area where we had some stuff that\u2019s pronounced by the predecessor company that we\u2019re largely through all that and that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing some growth there and then so the card you saw grow its seasonal that it grew and it\u2019s been stable for a number of quarters. The home equity side is growing quite strongly this stuff and home equity stuff high charge off contents to better decision economics of the company to run it. But the rest of the loan balance is we ought to see growth, with the exception of the sort of discretionary residential mortgage holdings which will continue to run down based on better view of what we want to do for management going forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And I think to your point sort of the deleveraging around China improve the leverage ratio as the impact of that should be easing going forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">That\u2019s correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. And just one last, a follow-up on -- I don't know if you mentioned this: where you guys are in the NSFR?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes we\u2019ve done a lot of work, we\u2019ve not put anything out public on that but as we\u2019ve looked through it and sort of we do not see that being a constrain as we go forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And our next question will come from Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O\u2019Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">The capital ratios grew more than expected. Obviously the decline in rates helped the positive earnings, and you mentioned the DTA consumption. As we think about 2015 and the drivers of capital, is it more of the same? Or is there, call it, optimization overall? Not just the loan runoff that you address, but as we think about -- you've had Final Rules for the last few months; there are still some adjustments to the business throughout. How should we think about the capital build? And if you have an estimate for 2015, that would be interesting as well?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Sure, we\u2019re not going to provide an estimate but what I\u2019d say is that as you look at overall capital levels, if you start with the numerator, as we project out and look at the earnings stream, we think that at least through '15 and possibly into the first part of '16 that on average you can have some quarterly bounces around based on timing and payments but that generally we should accrete capital over the course of at least four and up to six quarters largely based on the pre-tax earnings for the company as oppose to the after-tax earnings and that\u2019s what you saw during the fourth quarter. The other thing numerator as I referenced that, there is if we were to snap a quarter today there would be OCI benefit from the downward movement in rates, as it relates to what we\u2019re seeing under risk weighted asset side, I\u2019d say generally we continue to benefit although it declines a little bit each period. We continue to benefit from the run off of some of the global markets position that would have been put on in the 2005 to 2008 time frame that they tended to have tenures of seven to 10 years. In addition to that as we continue to have payoffs and as we continue to move out some of the comfort consumer real estate assets and put higher quality real estate assets on that are better credit borrowers while the asset levels may stay comparable, you do have an RWA pick up from that as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O\u2019Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">On RWA, any numbers you can provide in terms of how much benefit you get from them, I guess just priced on the credit correlation book and some of those contracts and the real estate running off, just those two pieces?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">No I mean I think as you look forward I mean these tend to be I think outside of op-risk this quarter, we had roughly $30 billion of risk weighted asset benefit under the advanced approach roughly half of that was in the consumer book, half of that was in the wholesale books. I think you will continue to see benefits but I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see the quarterly benefit of that magnitude on a go forward basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O\u2019Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. Then just separately, the home equity charge-offs increased a fair amount versus 3Q. Obviously, 3Q is a very low level. But remind me what's going on there. I think there was an accounting or methodology change a year ago. Has that fully worked through or is there seasonality or -- what's going on?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes, the biggest thing you have in home equity this quarter is that I believe it was roughly $150 million that went through charge off that was related to the DOJ settlement so realize we have of 150 charge off, 150 of reserve so from a net P&amp;L perspective it was a push but you did have that during the quarter and it\u2019s the reason that we wanted to give you the core charge off number Q3 to Q4 because as we implement the DOJ settlement, you will see both charge off and reserve release come out in each of probably the first and second quarter then we should be largely through that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And we will take our next question from Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Bruce, I was hoping you could maybe help explain what prompted the increase in operational risk RWA? The 34% I guess makes you an outlier relative to some of your peers, whereas previously you were more in line. I know the process typically is you submit the models to the regulators and/or the Fed and then they give you feedback. I wanted to know: was the increase prompted by the feedback from the regulators themselves as part of the annual review? Or was it what you determined based on your own internal models?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Answer the question slightly differently which is that, as we work through an interim process with our regulatory supervisors, we do believe at this point that from an op-risk perspective that we\u2019re adjusted and the amount of op-risk RWA that we have now is consistent with what you would need to exit parallel run.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay, understood. So we shouldn't expect any further increases as a percentage of RWA going forward; or is it simply too early to make that determination?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">We think with respect to op-risk RWA that we\u2019re there we obviously need to get through those elements that are rest of parallel run but from an perspective we feel like we\u2019re there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. That's really great. Then just one more quick one for me. I didn't hear in the prepared remarks any color on the investment banking backlog and didn't know if you can give us an update there as well?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yes, it\u2019s interesting and we\u2019ve to be a little bit careful I\u2019d say as we looked at the backlog and the pipeline particularly from an M&amp;A perspective that we feel very good about where the pipeline was at year-end, the part of the stronger year-end pipeline that we have the only tone of caution I would say is that we\u2019ve obviously seen a little bit more volatility in both the fixed income and equity of new issue markets but it relate to the amount of business that we\u2019re winning it\u2019s getting queued up in the pipeline we feel very good about that it was a good backlog at year-end.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">We\u2019ll take our next question from Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I just wanted to follow-up on a couple of topics that have been touched on already. Maybe just starting with the risk-weighted asset discussion once more, I just want to make sure I understand all the puts and takes of what's going into the risk-weighted asset calc. It sounds like on the positive side, obviously, there is the benefit of a GAAP balance sheet reduction as well as the trade-off between lower-quality and higher-quality assets. And it sounds like the operating-risk component is now fully baked in. But are there any other components that could drive that up in a way that's different from what's going on, on the GAAP balance sheet?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I think the only thing that\u2019s out there is that is as part of exiting parallel run we\u2019re working through with our supervisors that the different wholesale and other credit models that you need to exit parallel run so we\u2019re working through that but I think absent that you\u2019re largely at the point of looking at and you\u2019d expect that the RWA is going to largely follow the GAAP balance sheet. The one thing I think you all know this but where you could possible diverge from that is that there is pro cyclicality to the extent that you have volatility in the markets businesses as it relates to the stress bar calculations that go into the risk weighted asset but outside of that you\u2019d directionally expect it to follow the GAAP balance sheet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. And with respect to the GAAP balance sheet, what is your overall expectation about the net growth over '15?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I think you are probably going to largely see it in the zip code and probably be most correlated to the overall deposit balances and if you look at the range that we\u2019ve been running at over the last 12 months it\u2019s been in the 2.1 to 2.15, 2.175 type area and I\u2019d expect that area or that range to hold for 2015. </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Great. Then just to talk about the asset quality for a moment, obviously it was the lowest provision that we've seen from you in some time; and many of your peers are inflecting from the point of asset quality improvements to some modest now deterioration and the rebuilding of reserves. I just want to get a sense from you about where you think you are in that spectrum?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Sure, I think if we go back and let\u2019s start with the fact that we saw during the quarter that if we back out any impact of loan sales as well as the DOJ settlement charge-offs in the fourth quarter came down from $1.2 billion to just over $1 million I think as you look at charge-offs when you\u2019re virtually zero from a commercial perspective it\u2019s hard to see getting much better than that. I do think where we\u2019re probably a little bit different is that as we continue to work through and we had another solid improvement of a $2 billion from an NPL perspective within the consumer real estate space that we continue to work through and reduce those tougher consumer real estate credits, but I think that if you look at this $1 billion charge-off type level that we\u2019ve seen you\u2019re probably -- probably areas where you\u2019re going to see that flatten out and I think as we look forward there maybe a little bit reserve release on the first half of the year and you probably expect that to flatten out and go away as we get through 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Great. Then just finally on the LAS expense, which I know you've touched on several times, but I'm just wondering if the pace of that improvement changes at all as you are getting into the later stages of the delinquency and foreclosure inventory improvement?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yes, it does that and the plus side is that you would have ability to push the numbers down faster the economy continues to improve and the market continues to improve and the opportunities for borrowers and time passes, frankly. The flip side of that though, is in the states that -- in the areas where the process is slow sort of boiling the beaker and what is left is in the really slow areas and so we\u2019ve sort of caught up in the states where our progress goes through a reasonable fashion and we\u2019re still have the laggards in places that the process is traditionally oriented. So I think you're absolutely right. There is a buyer that get better at it and get lower as it starts improving but against that you get to the some of the rocks they are hard to move because the process is so slow. Secondly if you remember we had, we took up on 58,000 employees in that business and there is a lag to getting the real estate cost out and letting of buildings and all the stuff we had that is still until we got to be little careful getting ahead ourselves I think will come down first facility then come out second and so we are working hard on that so you're right that once see the improve the phase-in improvement continues almost normally or even normally better than past, but there is something that where we get there in terms of that is much harder and then secondly there is like for the hard cost over and above people cost.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">We can take our next question from Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I just want to go back to the net interest margin discussion a little bit. I thought that I heard you say in the prepared comments that there had been a shift in the balance of the asset sensitivity to more of a balance between long-term versus short-term rates. I was wondering if that is strictly a function of the FAS 91 issue in a falling long-rate environment. Or is there something more structural that you've been doing with the portfolio that has caused that to happen?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">It's the FAS 91, Guy you are absolutely correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. Then if we can just take a look at that one historically for a second, obviously over time that has caused quite a lot more volatility in your NIMs than it has for a lot of the peer group. I seem to remember that for regional banks, say, that have often had the same issue, there is a difference, I guess, in the way they accrue versus doing the constant resets that you do. And I was wondering why you do it in the way that you do, which seems to create more volatility.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">We probably wondered the same thing this quarter. All we can say, if you go back, you are right there are two ways that you can do this that the first is the way that we do it which is you have the premium, you look at the average life of the premium in each quarter you reset it and basically retroactively make that adjustment from when it started and that was determination that we have made a number of years ago. But you're right, the other way that has allowed and provided for under GAAP is that you just basically adjust as you grow and take it through the P&amp;L as you go and you can do it either of two ways and we obviously do it the way that we do.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Would you ever consider changing that? And if you were to do so, would there be a significant one-time charge that would be associated with that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">No, I think it goes the other way the reality is that we run through the P&amp;L that amortization to catch up in effective way ended up being lower than when the premium was set on. So, I think the way that we do it is absolutely appropriate and keep in mind, the other thing and I reference in my earlier comment is that, as you do this from a balance sheet perspective you're always adjusting the valuation of your AFS securities to be the fair market value at the time that you publish your financials and obviously that flows through our CI.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yes, fair enough. You also talked about changing line items or lines of business, where certain things are booked, as we move into 2015. That was fairly clear, except I was wondering: will this also entail moving the very large investment portfolio of your mortgages from all other into the Consumer category?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">It will not result in a large portion of mortgages being moved. There may be a smaller amount or a percentage of it that we continue to evaluate because the one thing that we want to make sure that we do is to have the geography of the financial statements motivate the behavior of the people that serve the client base that they do. So there maybe possibly a relatively small amount of home equity loans that could travel into the consumer business, but it's not going to be anything that the storage things in many meaningful way.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Then final one for me, you talked a little bit about the Investment Banking backlog at the turn of the year. But more broadly for Global Markets and Global Banking taken together, can you give us a sense -- now that we're a couple weeks into the year -- how the, in particular say, trading activity has started off? And given some of the increase in volatility, especially with big moves like what happened with the Swiss franc today, are you instructing the Global Markets business to pull back on risk? Or generally are you seeing that some of those volatility levels are in some way beneficial?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I think there is a couple of part to that. The first is I think if you look at overall risk levels that we ran within the global markets business and if you look at our information that we put out at year-end that even with the little bit of the pickup in volatility at year-end borrows it low levels and overall balance sheet levels where at low levels as we exited the year and I think with nine trading days into the quarter. So, I think it's a little bit early to forecast what you\u2019d expect for the quarter for the overall sales and trading businesses. The only thing I would say is that clearly the activity levels that we\u2019ve seen -- that have spend more way return to normal than what we experience in the month of December. But I wouldn\u2019t want anyone to draw any conclusions -- nine days, through 62 trading days in a quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And we can go next to Paul Miller with FBR. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Paul Miller</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Thank you very much, and most of the questions has been answered. But on your legacy assets -- and you talked about this a little bit, where your default numbers have dropped roughly to 189,000 from roughly I think 220,000. Did you sell anything? Or is that all improvement in just credit in the quarter? In other words, did you move the houses out, or did you also sell?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">My recollection is there was roughly a third of that came from the sales of both servicing as well as the underlying loans themselves. And then in addition to that we saw continued improvement in net new 60 pluses and then we obviously worked others through the normal foreclosure process as well as for those borrowers that cared.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Paul Miller</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">One of the things that -- because I -- on your -- you made a comment about that the lower oil prices has improved some of the consumer credit, consumer spending, and all that. Are you seeing any improvement in working through those 60-day defaults from that? Or those loans are just so old relatively speaking in the default bucket that the lower oil prices really doesn't help out?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">It\u2019s much too early to figure out what the lower price impact would have on mortgage, you\u2019re actually seeing consumer spend the money they\u2019re getting and you\u2019re seeing the consumer credit quality stay strong that you project out a period of low prices. You would see a benefit on consumer side offset by the commercial side. So I am not sure Paul in the context 60 days bucket to impact old days. But because people that are going to [indiscernible] first mortgage portfolio they keep coming down and that\u2019s the problem of long-term reduction.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Paul Miller</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Brian, I missed -- I was writing it down as fast as I could, but you talked about how that you are seeing consumer balances increase over the last couple months, I guess, or last month. Can you go over those numbers again?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Consumer spending increased that is that what you are referring to Paul. So far January of 2013 versus January of 2014, spending on credit debit cards of about 3% year-over-year and that\u2019s overcoming a drag effect of about percentage and a half from lower fuel prices.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And we can take our next question from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I wanted to drill into the Markets business a little bit. In the sense that we've seen pressure on fixed income the last two quarters, is there anything in the drivers of that weakness that would jeopardize the seasonal uptick that we usually see in the first quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I think if I understand your question, I think that the answer to that is no, if you go back and look at -- with the exception of last year the fourth quarter does tend to be the weakest quarter of the year seasonally. It was obviously a little bit more so this quarter but structurally there is nothing that would lead you to that, obviously it\u2019s a market that adds inflows but no there is not anything structural that would lead you to believe that that should be different.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Then there is a lot of noise in the Markets business, and I tried to take out as much as I could. What I'm trying to look at is expense elasticity relative to the revenues. From third quarter to fourth quarter it looked very effective, was about 80% in relation to expenses to revenue reduction. But over the last year, when you take out the litigation expense, looks like operating expenses only declined about 20% of what revenues declined. So I was just curious what you thought maybe the right elasticity number would be there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I think largely we saw in the fourth quarter was collection of the change in incentives levels due to more revenue and you\u2019d expect that to happen. But let me bring that a little higher to more broader point, which is about two years or three years ago Tom Montag and his team made a fundamental restructuring of that business to drop its expense phase to where as long as we get $2.5 billion more revenues, more or less we start making some money and if you adjust the FVA charge which is the one-time charge they made somewhere around $300 million this quarter to give you a sense. So it\u2019s the worst quarter $300 million and best quarter runs over 1 billion and that largely is really marginally profitable where you see the revenues go from the high 2 billion to the 3 billion level to the 4 billion, most of that comes through with the compensation of 19% 20% or something like that. So there is elasticity base, you get the lower level start to hit the floor on the fixed cost structure.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Then Brian, lastly, you've talked several times about the core expenses and the investments you're making. A lot of the core businesses, really all except Banking, showed declines in net income sequentially and year-over-year. Do you feel like you're investing to try to reignite some of that growth going forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Now one of the things you got to be careful, they reflect this all these charge that we talk about and pushed out all the businesses, so there is some elements that really aren\u2019t the businesses control for a lack of a better term. And then secondly you\u2019re still seeing as we move from a period where reserve releases were going along the business level you\u2019re seeing provision changes across the board to have it. But by enlarge if you look at the fees and address expenses which is two things they control the most you see a pretty good relationship going on and pretty good stability and I\u2019d say if you look across the businesses, the consumer bank continues to make good progress on sales capabilities and if actual sales look at some of the later pages you can see it, I said wealth management, we got to make sure the expenses in the revenues stay on line there we talked about that last quarter and John Thiel and team specially at Merrill Lynch are doing good job getting after that and innovating I think you\u2019ve seen a pretty good relationship if you back out sort of the fundamental impacts of FAS 91 and the provision things like that which says those adjustments we make at the top of the house and push through.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">We will take our next question from Mike Mayo with CLSA, please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">You highlighted that the expenses are at the lowest levels since the Merrill merger, and we estimate that they are down almost one-fourth over five years so that's certainly good. But we also note that revenues are down quite a bit over that time frame too. So how do you evaluate the trade-off between more aggressive restructuring and investing in the franchise? And specifically, you're pretty much done, I think, with New BAC. Would you have a program -- maybe Even Newer BAC, or a new restructuring plan?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Mike we\u2019ve piece of that obviously credit cost you got to think about in terms of if you look back look at the higher revenue levels at the time, the charge off run rate was $2 billion to $3 billion a quarter and one quarter was 10 billion approximately for cards especially so be careful about that but I\u2019d say your point really is what you do from now forward and we see that\u2019s we talked about in core expense space we decide the LAS litigation all that stuff it is just the core expense space basically what we continue to do is to take out non-productive expenses and the best part of that back in the franchise and bringing part of that to the ability to that core line continue to move that and that\u2019s down. Remember that when we\u2019re doing this we\u2019re absorbing housing cost increases, wage and salary increases, incentive comp increases so we\u2019re heavily focused on maintaining a rational balance between the core revenue and the core expense dynamic going forward and so you should expect to assume that to the continuous program looking at this, this is continued simplifier company could being take out divestures of the cost of the crises and as we have downsized the company takeout the overhead that was hard to shakeout as you\u2019re all aware so we\u2019re laser focused on so I think on the other hand we continue to investment sales capacity and you see that reflecting thing like card sales and home equity sales and auto loan sales, direct auto loans sales are increased.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">So, don\u2019t expect another new program with the expense targets is more of a day-to-day perspective now?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">No, remember we absorb if you think 50% of our cost being people cost and you think of inflationary level of cost increase of the 3% on this. Basically a key cost down and flattish, you got to work your tail off and whether and that\u2019s a sort of process going forward we\u2019ve to drop a cost down again to the reasonable level, we\u2019ll continue to make improvement relative to revenues and the rules get different we\u2019ll then have to revisit it but right now in this revenue environment, the slow growth environment we can keep the cost while as revenue start to rise.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Then a separate question: what are your key financial targets for 2015? I know you've expressed some of your targets, assuming interest rates increase. But if interest rates don't increase, what should investors evaluate you on at the end of 2015? All I had to go on without the higher interest rates is page 42 of the proxy that talks about the PRSUs. It says as long as you get over a 50 basis point ROA you go in the money on the PRSUs. So I'm not sure if I should be looking at the 50 basis point number, or its 80 basis points, 100% in the money, or the 1% number that you've talked about before. But again, assuming rates don't go up, what's your ROA and ROE target for 2015?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Mike, you don\u2019t get specific projections but our goal is to continue to take [indiscernible] level this quarter and driving forward and our view is that based on everything we see as we see the impact of all the work we\u2019re doing plus the rollover to cost base, the reduction of LAS cost, the litigation falling back to kinds of level you saw this quarter you do see this move towards that those long term goals of 1% ROA and 12% return of ample common equity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">One last try, that 1% and 12%, that assumes higher interest rates. If your forecasts do not expect higher interest rates as soon as they do right now, at what point would you take additional action with expenses? And how do you think about that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">We take additional action expenses every afternoon. In other words we had 4,000 reductions FVA in the fourth quarter of 2014 Mike that was a core franchise to keep getting efficient. So, we work on expenses every day, and we\u2019ve teams of people working to do all things that you expect us to do.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And we can take our last question from Nancy Bush with NAB Research, please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Nancy Bush</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Two questions, Brian, I'm a little bit confused about the card growth. I think you said you got 1.2 million new cards out in the fourth quarter. Is that -- and didn't you mention something about it being seasonal? You've got lots of ground that you can gain in that business and I just want to clarify whether this is something extraordinary going on here and what your projections are for the future for growth there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Yes, Nancy, sorry if we confused you let\u2019s talk about the production of new cards unit, that\u2019s the one 1.84 million to look at Page 19 you can see it building from the fourth quarter '12 830 million, 830,000 so the first is production of units and the second was balances, balances in card disrupt in the fourth quarter almost $3 billion net to $3 billion that we got to careful because Christmas people even spend on borrowing and it pay down. So the point there is that will seasonal how to -- but if you look back in prior quarters we\u2019ve seen a stability in our card balances which is continues on more units the people continue to use the card we don\u2019t expect the positive growth there. But its units 1.2 million balance is good 2.5 billion to 3 billion and the balance is [indiscernible] seasonality unit then above 1 million new production units each quarter of the last several quarters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Nancy Bush</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Is there one particular card that's proving to be very popular? I see your ads for the cash-back cards, etc. Is that the card of choice at this point?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Yes, in fact that is our core card offering. We\u2019ve simplified our offering to three or four core products and that\u2019s the biggest one and it\u2019s contributing to sort of card income being up year-over-year by about 7% and so it\u2019s card selling well and the good news is we see is 67% came through basically our web online sales process and our branch sales process in the core customer so we continue to drive that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Nancy Bush</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Okay. Secondly, the 25% margin in Wealth Management, I think back to the old days when you had much fatter margins in that business. What do you see as a normalized margin in Wealth Management? Number two, to what impact is the Wealth Management margin being maybe impacted by high liquidity levels that customers are maintaining? And do you see that changing?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bruce Thompson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">I\u2019d say a couple of things and I think the first is that we\u2019ve said that over the course of the couple of years that we need that wealth management margin to get to 30% I think you\u2019ve got a couple of things going on right now, in the low rate environment that business has an artificial drag because as you know you don\u2019t tend to payout compensation which is a significant portion of the expense to those things that are net interest income related. So we would expect we also have in 2016 some deferred comp and other programs running off. So as we go through over the course of the next couple of years between the business growing normalization of rate environment and some other things that should be a 30% type pre-tax margin business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Moynihan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">I think we\u2019re through all the questions. So thank you very much for joining us and we\u2019ll look forward to speak in next quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Operator </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">This concludes today\u2019s program.
