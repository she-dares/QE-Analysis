Today's call will be hosted by John Andrews, Head of Citi Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions] Mr. Andrews, you may begin.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>John Andrews</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you everyone this morning for joining us. On the call today, of course, Vikram will take us through the presentation, initially, followed by John Gerspach, our CFO, who will take you through the detailed deck, which available on our website. Afterwards, they will be happy to take your questions. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may concern forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2009 Form 10-K. With that said and out of the way, let me turn it over to Vikram. Vikram?</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Vikram Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">John, thank you, and good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us today. 2010 was a very good year for Citi. We made excellent progress in executing our strategy in every major area and, as a matter of fact, if you had said a year ago that we would have accomplished what we have, I'm not so sure too many people would have believed it. Yet, we were profitable in each quarter, earning $10.6 billion for the year. Revenues increased for the quarter and for the year in two of our three core businesses, which are Transaction Services and Consumer Banking, and Securities and Banking had strong full year results.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Entering 2010, our primary goal was to become consistently profitable and we achieved it. Another goal was to continue to reduce assets in Citi Holdings and we did so by $128 billion. Remaining assets are now 19% of our balance sheet and that's down from almost 40% of the balance sheet at their peak. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We also have been building for the future from opening branches in Asia to making new investments in technology to attracting top-notch talent to our consumer and Institutional businesses. And we're building a position of strength that will allow us to harness the world's growth trends. And of course, the capstone to the year was the sale of the government's remaining shares of common stock. To date, U.S. taxpayers have earned a profit of approximately $12 billion on their investment in Citigroup and we'll always be grateful for the investment they made in our company and for standing by us through this financial crisis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Specifically for the fourth quarter, our client business and flows were solid across the board and we saw a strong growth in our consumer franchise, especially outside the U.S. On the Institutional side, although Transaction Services and Banking performed well, revenues in markets reflected weaker trading performance. And of course, we're happy to see our credit spreads improve as much as they did. That is a good sign. Not only of our progress, but also it'll reduce our cost of borrowing over time. But of course, it means that we had to take $1.1 billion charge due to CVA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">For 2011, we will build on the foundation we put in place and accelerate our strategy for Citicorp. We'll make investments to increase our lead in the emerging markets. We will seek to become a leader in digital banking and mobile payments. And we'll continue to recruit top talent, building on the key hires we made last year. And we'll do so despite a challenging economic backdrop. The effects of the financial crisis are still working their way through the system, and I think that macro trends will dominate micro trends, especially for the next few quarters. And although there are positive signs in the U.S. economy, the housing market yet has to recover, job creation has been weak and internationally excessive government leverage is still hampering recovery in the euro zone.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We continue to build our capital base, our Tier 1 common ratio now stands at 10.7%, up from 9.6% at the beginning of the year. Through earnings and reductions in Citi Holdings, we have built  robust loan loss reserves of $40.7 billion. We have participated in the stress test with the regulators and, subject to their guidance, we still expect to be in a position to return capital to our shareholders in 2012.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Summing up, I believe we have the right business model, the right strategy for our company's present and future, and we are executing with discipline. The economic environment remains uncertain but our path for the future is clear. We've steadily built a foundation capable of producing consistent profitability and our focus now is on achieving sustained and responsible growth.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">With that, I'd like to turn this over to John Gerspach and then we'll come back later and take some of your questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Thank you, Vikram, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 2. On a full year basis, Citigroup reported revenues of nearly $87 billion for 2010. Operating expenses totaled $47.4 billion. Credit costs were $26 billion, down 50% from prior year levels on a comparable basis. And for the full year, we earned $10.6 billion in net income or $0.35 per diluted share. We earned nearly $15 billion in our core Citicorp business, with earnings in Asia and Latin America contributing more than half of the total. Citi Holdings generated a loss of $4.2 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Now turning to the quarter on Slide 3. Citigroup reported fourth quarter net income of $1.3 billion or $0.04 per diluted share. These results were significantly affected by three factors. First, CVA was a negative $1.1 billion as Citi spreads tightened in the fourth quarter, particularly following the U.S. Treasury sale of its remaining Citi shares in December. Second, revenues in Securities and Banking were lower due to weaker trading performance in the Fixed Income and Equities businesses. And third, expenses were $12.5 billion, up 8% from the last quarter and above our prior guidance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Of the expense increase, more than half was due to the combined impact of foreign exchange and higher legal and related costs, while the remainder was attributable to severance, volume-related growth in certain businesses and continued investments. On the positive side, credit continued to improve in the quarter, with net credit losses declining 11% to $6.9 billion and we recorded a net loan loss reserve release of $2.3 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Turning now to Citicorp and Citi Holdings on Slide 4. Our credit costs continued to decline in each segment, driven by improvements in both consumer and corporate credit. Citicorp reported revenues of $14.3 billion and net income of $2.4 billion. The underlying business drivers for Citicorp continued to show momentum in the fourth quarter. As an example, for the second consecutive quarter, we grew both consumer and corporate loans in Citicorp, primarily in the emerging markets. Sequentially, end of period consumer loans were up 3% and corporate loans grew 4%. Citi Holdings reported revenues of $4 billion and a net loss of $1 billion. Citi Holdings ended the year with $359 billion of assets, down $62 billion during the quarter and $128 billion for the year, including the sale of Student Loan Corporation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On Slide 5, we show a nine-quarter trend for Citicorp's results. CVA was negative $1 billion for Citicorp in the fourth quarter compared to a positive $99 million last quarter. Excluding CVA, Citicorp's revenues were $15.3 billion, down 6% versus the prior quarter due to lower revenues in Securities and Banking. Operating expenses of $9.4 billion were up 6% versus the prior quarter, roughly a quarter of the increase was due to the impact of foreign exchange. The remainder was primarily due to higher legal and related costs, volume-related growth and continued investments in our core businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Citicorp's net credit losses were $2.7 billion, down 12% from the previous quarter, driven by Citi-Branded Cards in North America and lower corporate net credit losses. We released $741 million in net loan loss reserves, up from $426 million in the third quarter, as higher net releases in Citi-Branded Cards and our corporate portfolio were partially offset by lower releases in our International Consumer businesses. Excluding CVA, earnings before taxes declined 16% to $3.9 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Slide 6 highlights our North America Consumer Banking business. Revenues of $3.6 billion were down 5% sequentially. Lower revenue in cards reflects a charge for enhancements to our thank you rewards program, as well as the continued impact of CARD Act. Lower retail revenue was mainly due to lower refinancing gains in the mortgage business. Expenses were up 7% to $1.6 billion, reflecting a one-time benefit in the prior quarter, as well as higher legal and related costs. Credit costs declined 29% to $1.4 billion. Net credit losses were down 10% to $1.8 billion, due to continued improvement in Citi-Branded Cards and we recorded a $348 million net loan loss reserve release.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Net credit margin increased 1% to $1.8 billion as the decline in net credit losses more than offset lower revenues. While average loans were flat to slightly down versus the prior quarter, end of period card loans were up 1% sequentially and retail loans were up 4%. In cards, open accounts were stable versus the prior quarter and purchase sales grew 4% sequentially. While overall purchase sales declined versus last year, due to a lower account base, sales per active account grew year-over-year for the fourth consecutive quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to Slide 7. Our International Consumer Banking businesses had revenues of $4.6 billion, up 4% sequentially, with growth across all regions. This growth reflects strong momentum in underlying business drivers, as well as the impact of foreign exchange. Underlying revenue drivers were positive again this quarter. However, revenue growth was muted as spreads remained under pressure. We grew our average deposits in every region during the quarter, and average loans grew 5% sequentially in both Asia and Latin America.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Card purchase sales were up 14% sequentially and investment sales grew 11%, as strong growth in Asia and EMEA was offset by a decline in Latin America as customers continued to shift to longer-term securities. Expenses were $2.8 billion, up 10% from the prior quarter, reflecting the impact of foreign exchange and continued investments in the business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Credit costs were up 70% to $593 million, driven by a lower net loan loss reserve release during the quarter. NCL dollars were stable. These credit trends reflect these regions being substantially further along in their economic recovery and, hence, much closer to a normalized credit environment than North America. On a rate basis, international net credit losses continued to improve and NCL dollars were flat against the growing loan balance. Net credit margin increased 5% sequentially to $3.8 billion in the fourth quarter, driven by revenue growth.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Slide 8 shows nine quarters of business drivers and financial performance for international Consumer Banking. Following a period of repositioning in 2009, we returned to growth across every significant metric in 2010, reflecting both economic recovery in these regions, as well as our renewed investment spending. Year-over-year, average loans and deposits were up 12% and 11%, respectively. Trends in card purchase sales and investment sales were also up, with full year 2010 results above 2008 levels. This growth in underlying business drivers is reflected in our financial results. On a full year basis, net credit margin of $14.3 billion in 2010 was up 21% over the prior year. And net income more than doubled, reflecting the additional benefit of loan loss reserve releases.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Slide 9 shows our Securities and Banking business. Excluding CVA, revenues of $4.6 billion were down 17% from the third quarter, driven by weaker revenues in fixed income and Equity Markets, partially offset by growth in Investment Banking and lending revenues. In Investment Banking, revenues grew 25% to $1.2 billion as significantly higher equity underwriting revenues, driven by Asia IPO activity, and stable debt underwriting revenue were partially offset by a decline in M&amp;A fees. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">x CVA, equity market revenues were $808 million. The $254 million sequential decline primarily reflects weaker trading revenues linked to our derivatives business and principal positions. Fixed Income market revenues x CVA were down 32% to $2.3 billion. The decline was primarily attributable to weaker performance in market-making activities to facilitate client needs. Lending revenues were $185 million compared to a negative $18 million in the prior quarter, driven by smaller hedge losses on continued spread tightening for corporate credits. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Private Bank revenues, excluding CVA, were up 3% to $506 million. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On a regional basis, revenues excluding CVA grew 8% sequentially in Latin America and 3% in Asia. Total operating expenses were up 2% versus the prior quarter. Credit costs were a benefit in the fourth quarter as net credit losses declined 54% to $132 million, and we released $194 million in net loan loss reserves.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Moving to Transaction Services on Slide 10. Revenues of $2.6 billion were up 1% from the third quarter, driven by growth in Asia and Latin America. Treasury and Trade Solutions was down 1%, as higher trade revenues increased deposits and higher fees were more than offset by spread compression. Securities and Fund Services grew 6% sequentially, driven by higher volumes. Overall, transaction volumes and new mandates remain strong across both businesses during the quarter. Asset growth was driven by trade finance, with end of period trade assets up 14% sequentially and nearly double versus last year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Average deposits grew 4% sequentially to $353 billion, and assets under custody were up 2% to $12.6 trillion. Expenses of $1.3 billion were up 7% from last quarter, reflecting both higher volumes and continued investment to support the business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Slide 11 shows Citi Holdings assets. We ended the quarter with $359 billion in Citi Holdings or 19% of total Citigroup assets. The $62 billion reduction in the fourth quarter was comprised of $48 billion of asset sales and business dispositions, including $31 billion from Student Loan Corporation and $10 billion of sales from the Special Asset Pool, approximately $12 billion of net runoff and pay downs and $2 billion of net cost of credit and net asset marks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On Slide 12, we show a nine quarter trend for Citi Holdings results. We narrowed the loss in Citi Holdings to $1 billion in the fourth quarter. Revenues were up 3% to $4 billion as higher revenues in Brokerage and Asset Management and the Special Asset Pool were offset by a decline in Local Consumer Lending. Expenses were up 7% to $2.4 billion and credit costs were down 13% to $2.9 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Looking at Citi Holdings in more detail on Slide 13. Revenues in Brokerage and Asset Management were up sequentially to $136 million, reflecting a higher contribution from the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney joint venture. In Local Consumer Lending, revenues were down 4% sequentially to $3.4 billion, as gains on asset sales were more than offset by lower revenues on a declining loan balance, as well as the refund reserve build related to our consumer finance business in Japan. In the Special Asset Pool, revenues were up 36% to $426 million in the fourth quarter, mainly due to higher gains on asset sales during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Expenses were up 7% sequentially to $2.4 billion, reflecting higher legal and related costs and severance. Credit costs were down 13% sequentially as credit trends continued to improve in both our consumer and corporate portfolios. Total net credit losses were down 10% to $4.2 billion and the net loan loss reserve release was down slightly to $1.5 billion. Local Consumer Lending continues to drive the earnings performance of Citi Holdings, with $1.1 billion net loss for the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Slide 14 shows the results for the Corporate/Other segment. Revenues declined by $450 million sequentially, reflecting lower gains on sales of AFS Securities. Net income also reflects higher operating expenses during the quarter. Expenses were up by $286 million sequentially, mainly due to legal and related costs. Assets of $272 billion include approximately $92 billion of cash and cash equivalents, and $124 billion of liquid available-for-sale Securities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Slide 15 shows total Citigroup net credit losses and loan loss reserves. NCLs continued to improve, down 11% sequentially to $6.9 billion and the net loan loss reserve release grew 14% to $2.3 billion. We ended the year with $40.7 billion of total loan loss reserves and our LLR ratio was 6.3%. Consumer NCLs declined 8% sequentially to $6.2 billion, and we released $1.3 billion in net loan loss reserves.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Corporate credit was a benefit of $256 million in the fourth quarter compared to a cost of $347 million last quarter. Corporate net credit losses declined 28% to $664 million and the net loan loss reserve release grew to $920 million. Corporate non-accrual loans of $8.6 billion were down 13% versus the prior quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Moving to consumer credit trends on Slide 16. As I mentioned, consumer net credit losses of $6.2 billion were down 8% sequentially, with continued improvement in North America cards and real estate. Our net credit loss ratio declined again this quarter to 5.3% and our loan loss reserve ratio was 7.8%. In North America, net credit losses declined 9% to $5.1 billion, while international net credit losses declined by 6% to $1.1 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Slide 17 shows our International Consumer credit trends. In Citicorp, NCL improvement on a dollar basis is slowing down as we grow our international loan portfolios. However, on a rate basis, we continued to see NCL improvement in both Asia and Latin America. In Asia, India continued to show the most significant improvement in both NCLs and delinquencies. For the region, 90-plus day delinquencies were relatively flat on a dollar basis and down as a percentage of loans. In Latin America, NCLs improved on a rate basis, driven by cards in Brazil and Mexico, and 90-plus day delinquencies also improved. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Now on Slide 18, we focus on North America cards.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Trends for both Citi branded and Retail Partner Cards continued to reflect the improving credit quality of these portfolios. In Citi-Branded Cards, NCLs declined for the third consecutive quarter. NCLs decreased by 11% to $1.7 billion and 90-plus day delinquencies were down 12% to $1.6 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">In Retail Partner Cards, NCLs were down for the sixth consecutive quarter. NCLs decreased by 10% to $1.4 billion and 90-plus day delinquencies declined by 8% to $1.6 billion. For both portfolios, early-stage delinquencies also continued to show improvement.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Turning to the mortgage portfolio in Citi Holdings on Slide 19. NCLs and 90-plus day delinquencies in both first and second mortgages improved again this quarter. We continue to manage down these portfolios. Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, we reduced our first mortgage portfolio by almost 20% to $80 billion and second mortgages were down 14% to $44 billion, through a combination of sales, runoff and net credit losses. Our total loan loss reserve balance for mortgages in Citi Holdings currently represents over two years of NCL coverage.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Slide 20 provides more detail on the delinquency trends in first mortgages in Citi Holdings. 30-plus day delinquencies were down for the fifth consecutive quarter. Delinquencies declined by 15% to $9.9 billion, with improvement across all buckets. Similar to last quarter, the sequential decline in delinquencies was due entirely to asset sales and trial mods converting to permanent modifications, absent which delinquencies would be up slightly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">During the fourth quarter, we sold $1.5 billion in delinquent mortgages, bringing our total sales of delinquent mortgages for the year to $4.8 billion. Mortgage sales served to reduce our overall delinquency inventory. They also eliminate any future risk of default as compared to modifications. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Through the end of the year, we had converted a total of $4.8 billion of trial mods to permanent modifications, more than three quarters of which were HAMP. We continue to believe that redefault rates for HAMP modified loans will be significantly lower versus non-HAMP programs. The first HAMP mods have now been on the books for about 12 months and, to date, are exhibiting redefault rates of less than 15%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On Slide 21, we provide an update on rep and warranty issues. The chart on the left shows claims and repurchase activity on a unit basis. Over the past three years, we have received claims on roughly 20,400 unindemnified loans. At year end, nearly 4,600 of those claims remained pending, which was slightly lower than our pending claim volume at the end of the third quarter. Of the roughly 15,800 claims which have been resolved, approximately 7,600 or nearly 50% were actually repurchased or made whole. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Based on our current expectations, we believe claims volumes should peak in the latter part of 2011. The right side of this slide shows a roll forward of the repurchase reserve for our Consumer Mortgage business. We began the fourth quarter with approximately $952 million of repurchase reserves. We added approximately $4 million of reserves, arising from new mortgage sales in the fourth quarter, and another $248 million related to changes in our estimate of average loss per claim. These additions to the reserve were charged to our P&amp;L during the quarter as contra revenue. We realized approximately $235 million of losses during the quarter, which were charged against the reserve. As a result, we ended the year with $969 million in mortgage repurchase reserves.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Slide 22 shows the trend in our key capital metrics. We ended the year with a Tier 1 ratio of 12.9% and a Tier 1 Common ratio of 10.7%. Our Tier 1 Common ratio grew approximately 40 basis points during the quarter, reflecting a 1% increase in Tier 1 Common capital to $105 billion and a 2% reduction in risk-weighted assets, due in part to the continued wind down of Citi Holdings. On a year-over-year basis, our GAAP assets grew 3% while we reduced our risk-weighted assets by 10%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">In summary, our performance in 2010 creates a strong foundation for sustainable growth. Where 2009 was focused on recapitalizing the firm and putting into place our new strategy, 2010 saw our return to profitability as we earned nearly $15 billion in our core Citicorp business while we cut losses in Citi Holdings by more than half. The strength of our international franchise was particularly apparent in 2010, with Asia and Latin America earning over $8 billion, a 14% increase versus 2009. And that growth and profitability was achieved while continuing to invest in these regions. We made significant progress in reducing Citi Holdings, with assets declining $128 billion or 26% versus 2009. Today, Citi Holdings represents only 19% of total Citigroup assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Two consistent themes drove our performance in 2010. First, global credit continued to recover, with six consecutive quarters of sustained improvement in credit costs. And second, we began increasing our investment spending in international businesses as the pace of economic recovery accelerated in these regions, resulting in strong growth in our underlying business drivers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Finally, our consistent profitability, combined with the ongoing wind down of Citi Holdings, contributed to our strong balance sheet. We ended 2010 with a Tier 1 Common ratio of 10.7%, up approximately 110 basis points from last year, making us one of the best capitalized large banks in the world. We remain confident, based on what we know today, that we will be well above the Basel III capital requirements and above the 8% to 9% on a Tier 1 Common basis in 2012.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Now I'd like to discuss some factors which may affect our results in 2011. In Regional Consumer Banking, we believe results will be driven by different trends in North America versus our international businesses. In North America, if economic recovery is sustained, revenues are expected to grow modestly as loan demand begins to recover, particularly in the second half of the year. However, net credit margin recovery will likely continue to be driven primarily by improvement in net credit losses. As always, loan loss reserve balances will continue to reflect the losses embedded in the portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Internationally, we have seen the improvement in net credit losses slowing as the loan portfolios grow. Given continued economic expansion in these regions, net credit margin is more likely to be driven by revenue growth, particularly in the second half of the year. As our investment spending should continue to generate volume growth to outpace spread compression.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">International credit costs are likely to increase in 2011, reflecting a growing loan portfolio. In Securities and Banking, our continued investments served to build on an already strong foundation for future growth. The strength of our franchise should be evident in 2011, as it was in our full 2010 results. Overall, Securities and Banking will continue to reflect trends in client activity and global market conditions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">In Local Consumer Lending in Citi Holdings, revenue should continue to decline, given a shrinking loan balance resulting from pay downs and continued asset sales. Based on current delinquency trends and ongoing loss mitigation actions, we expect credit costs to continue to improve in Local Consumer Lending. Regarding expenses, we expect 2011 expense levels to be in line with our 2010 guidance at $48 billion to $50 billion for the year, with some variability across quarters as we continue investing in Citicorp while rationalizing Citi Holdings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">That concludes our review of the quarter. And Vikram and I will now open up the line for questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p7\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">I was hoping that maybe you could quantify how much of the linked quarter's increase in expenses actually was litigation, which was one of the primary factors you noted?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">If you think in terms of the way it breaks down, about $150 million of the increase was due to foreign exchange, about $400 million more or less was legal and related matters, $100 million was severance and restructuring and about $150 million each of investment and volume driven growth.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Within Securities and Banking, did the expense increase in comp, which I know you don't break out, did that pretty much reflect -- well, actually, I should phrase it differently. Did the comp reflect the decline in revenue or was it also up sequentially?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Well, as you said, Guy, we don't breakout comp for any of our individual businesses. But, obviously, our comp considerations reflect performance for the full year. Throughout the year, we do our best to estimate what we think we're going to be paying out. So we take all of that into consideration.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">I guess what I'm trying to get at is whether there would've been a significant increase in litigation type expenses within S&amp;B.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">There was some contribution in S&amp;B of litigation, but I wouldn't say that S&amp;B was the primary driver behind the $400 million that I talked about earlier.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And is it fair to assume that a fair amount of that litigation expense would be reserve building related to things like private label Securities? I know that one of your competitors has talked about not really being able to build for that use through the reserve, but that litigation reserves can be built for that type of thing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">As we said, I think it was last quarter, we believe that the types of claims associated with private label securitizations are going to manifest themselves in the context of litigation. We made that statement last quarter and that kind of holds true. But as we've said last quarter, to date, we have not received a significant number of claims in connection with private label securitizations. Obviously, we continued to monitor all the activities associated with this, but given the relative lack of historical experience, it naturally kind of follows on that it's difficult to estimate future claims here. So as with all such matters, we're continuing to evaluate our litigation reserves and at the end of the quarter, overall, we feel that we are appropriately reserved and that we're going to continue to monitor everything that's going on with private label securitizations. The other thing, Guy, I think you have to put our position of private label securitizations a bit in context. When you think in terms of the issuances that were done in '05 through '08, we had about a 3% market share and as near as we can tell, we probably ranked eighth among issuers during that time period. Some of our peer institutions have market shares that are 5x or 8x higher than that, so while private label securitizations are something that we obviously are continuing to monitor, it, quite frankly, isn't as big an exposure for us as it might be for others.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And then moving to another subject, just to explore a little bit further the revenue side in Securities and Banking during the quarter. We saw a pretty significant falloff in fixed income, and I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more of a sense. First of all, was a lot of that in December, after a more successful first couple of months? Or was it a little bit more spread over the period? And can you give us a sense for whether some of the product related declines that you alluded to, in terms of rates, were because of the shock that happened in long-term interest rates? Or was it just more because of a decline in customer activity levels?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yes, I'm going to take a pass on going through month-to-month performance. But the decline was not due to a decline in customer volume levels. Customer activity stayed pretty solid during the quarter. And as we tried to indicate, it really did reflect just weaker trading performance, especially in the Fixed Income business. As far as what products may have driven it, I would say that G10 Rates probably contributed 2/3, maybe, of the decline, due to the weaker trading performance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">The final question I have for you is on the net interest margin, which declined pretty much in line with the guidance that you had given us early in the quarter. And I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more of a sense for what you thought might happen with net interest margin based on things that you can see now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I might comment, Guy, but about half of that decline that we had in the quarter, half of the 12 basis points, was due to the building of the reserve for customer refunds in our Consumer Finance business in Japan. So absent that, the decline in NIM would have been closer to six basis points. And I think that pretty much forms my view as to what might happen going into the first quarter. We could be looking at something in the mid-low digits as far as a decline in NIM. And then maybe it'll stabilize beginning in the second quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Shore with Nomura Securities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Glenn Shore</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Question on deposit trends. U.S. were up, non-U.S. were down and non-interest bearing deposits were up and interest-bearing were down. And it's just kind of counterintuitive, I didn't know if that's a repricing thing in conscious effort on your part or a client trend. I don't know how to read into that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">A conscious effort on our part. One of the things that I think we mentioned last time is, that we are looking at improving the quality of the deposits that we have. So we actually adjusted our pricing to try to capture more of non-interest bearing and less -- we've got such a good demand for non-interest bearing that there's no need to go out and continue to be in the middle of the pack as far as time deposit pricing. So we've pretty much moved our time deposit pricing down in virtually all regions. And there was also, in North America, there was a bit of a one-time shift that we had between NOW, in NOW accounts, that used to be part of interest-bearing and are now classified as far as non-interest bearing. So that contributed in North America to about $9 billion to $10 billion of the growth there. So it's a conscious trend on our part, but the NOW account shift is a significant one-time item in North America.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Glenn Shore</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">With the clear credit improvement and, especially on the card side, just curious if you had any thoughts about the private label card business in general on whether or not you wind up hanging onto that or is that in the potential disposal list?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Well, don't forget, when we've set up Citicorp and Citi Holdings, it wasn't set up on a good bank, bad bank strategy. It was actually set up, Citicorp represented those businesses that fit the strategy that we have going forward and the businesses that we placed in Citi Holdings, including Retail Partner Cards, for those businesses that just didn't fit. So I would never say never, but what we'd have to look at is to see whether or not Retail Partner Cards or some elements of Retail Partner Cards are now really fitting in with the Citicorp strategy, based upon the re-underwriting of the book and the way that businesses or portfolios in that business are now being managed.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Glenn Shore</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">At the high level, as a general comment, I think people are looking at this and say, \"Revenue is a little weaker.\" Albeit it was a trading thing, but revenue is weaker and expense is still in that same range and you were kind enough to give us expense guidance for 2011. People want to hear if revenues come in a little softer, do you have expense flexibility, considering the legal and the investments and the things like that that are going on. I think that's one of the disappointments in today's results.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yes, and we will tend to pace our investment spending based upon the way we see the other investments playing out. So the short answer is, yes, we do have flexibility in our expense base.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I guess just a bigger picture question on trading. I can appreciate that it's volatile for everyone, it can depend on the mix quarter-to-quarter. But just in general, it seems like you're trading is a little more volatile, very weak quarter here and then all of a sudden, a very strong quarter. And is that just a difference in the product mix or something else that you could point to? And could we see a little less volatility going forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I'm not so sure of the underlying thesis in your question, which is why I'm having a difficult time answering it, Matt. I'm not sure that our trading is anymore volatile than anybody else's, especially when you eliminate the impact of CVA from it. I think CVA, certainly throughout 2009 and now in the fourth quarter of 2010, maybe has been a bigger contributor to us than to others. Otherwise, I'm not quite sure that we really fall outside the band necessarily.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Obviously, we're still getting results this quarter, but I guess we can see at the end of the quarter. But it felt like it's been a little more volatile.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Well, one quarter doesn't make a trend. And so I think you need to take a look at the overall trading performance over several quarters, if not several years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Vikram Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Matt, it's also fair to say that we have a smaller Equity business compared to some of the other firms on the street and we're building that out. And we also have a smaller Commodities business, that also is being built out. So a lot more of our revenues are driven by the Fixed Income business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And then just a couple of model questions going forward. You had a very modest tax credit this quarter. How should we think about the tax rate next year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Well, tax rates, on a normal basis, if you look at us over time, our expectation is, that our tax rate should be in the upper 20s. 27%, 28% would be the right range. But as long as we are in periods where more of our income is going to be driven by our performance in lower tax rate jurisdictions. In other words, as we're continuing to rebuild the North America business, particularly the earnings stream in North America consumer, our tax rate will be below the numbers that I just quoted.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And then just lastly, another follow-up on the expenses. As we think about 2011 expenses, you mentioned some of the puts and takes in terms of investment spend, as well as assets freeing up or as you run off assets and free up some expenses, should we think about the first half of expenses being higher or lower than the second half? Or more of a steady throughout the year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I would look at it more as a steady state type of thing. I'm not going to say that our expenses are going to be back-end loaded or front-end loaded. I think we'll have a little, obviously, we will look to pace investments based upon where we are. So, if anything, the expenses might tend to be a little back-end loaded, but I don't think it's going to be a huge trend.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question comes from the line of James Mitchell with Buckingham Research.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>James Mitchell - Goldman Sachs</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">A couple of questions, one on the loan loss reserve in cards. You guys, I think, over the year-to-date have probably released just a little over $300 million in reserves. For some of your peers, I think even though they're slightly larger in the card business, have released multiple billions. You've had two quarters in a row of improvement. When should we start to see a more significant release on the Citi card portfolio?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Well, as we've always said, when we take a look at reserves, we try to make sure that the reserves reflect the losses that are embedded in those individual portfolios. So as we get more confidence that the losses embedded in that portfolio are truly declining, you're likely to see continued reserve releases. I can't tell you that you're suddenly going to see a $1 billion reserve release. We don't tend to build them in big increments like that, and we don't tend to release them in big increments like that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>James Mitchell - Goldman Sachs</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">The reserve ratio is quite high relative to peers obviously, right? And they seem pretty confident releasing, but obviously, that's fine. On the iBank side, maybe getting to the expense question in another way. Year-to-date, I think if you normalize the DVA or CVA, however you want to define it, your revenues are down close to 19% in S&amp;B, but expenses were up, I think, 11%. Obviously, you put a lot of investment into this year. Should we start to see, assuming we have a better rate revenue environment, some operating leverage on the expense base in 2011 and beyond?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes, I'm not going to predict operating leverage, especially in a business like Securities and Banking. One thing I'd say is, 2009, I do think we had somewhat outsized performance coming out of the first quarter in 2009. So that clearly is a difficult point of comparison. And, as we've said, our view is that we had weaker trading results in the fourth quarter. We'll see how we performed and our expectation is that we'll pick up that performance during 2011. As far as investments, we've also been, I think, pretty clear that we had made significant investments in building out our Corporate Banking franchise. And earlier in the year, we were still building out equities. We think a lot of equities is now done. The Corporate Banking franchise is still an area where we've got, I think, some work to do, but I think most of the investment work in Securities and Banking now is behind us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>James Mitchell - Goldman Sachs</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">One last question on the Securities investment portfolio. It was down, I think, $21 billion on a period-end basis. Is that sort of positioning for the rate environment? What is your stance vis-\u00e0-vis rates at this point?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">When you take a look at -- you're talking about the investment Securities, the AFS, right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>James Mitchell - Goldman Sachs</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">We are in the midst of repositioning that book, given the rate environment. I'm not going to make a public statement as to where we think rates are going, but it's just that obviously we did take some of the Securities off the table and that's one of the reasons why our cash balances are higher right now. And so you'll see the results of that repositioning as we get further into the first quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">One was back in the sales and trading commentary, you were giving one of the reasons for the down quarter was market making as well as principal position. I'm wondering how to read that in terms of what might be permanent versus cyclical? Is part of this your positioning for the vulcur [ph] exit versus market  making and assuming market or what have you?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes, we've always said that proprietary trading or principal positions is a relatively small part of our overall business. We've said publicly that proprietary trading represents less than 2% of our firm revenues. And there is a small prop business that's in equities. During the third quarter, it generated revenues of about $150 million and virtually generated no revenues in the fourth quarter. So that's $150 million out of the $250 million overall decline in our Equity Markets revenues x CVA, quarter-on-quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Separate question on capital. I know that the proposal period is ongoing right now with the regulators and you probably can't talk about you've asked for, but I just wanted to ask if you are thinking about whether or not you can do anything this year. I know that in your opening remarks, you discussed returning capital to shareholders in 2012. Is that the earliest date that you're anticipating a return of capital to shareholders?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Vikram Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Betsy, obviously, all of us still have to go through the process with the regulators and I think that's going to be informative for us, all of us. But as importantly, we want to make sure that we are exactly in the right place on Basel III. And including, by the way, as I've said in the past, we think it's always prudent to carry a little bit of a cushion. You take all that into account, we still think 2012 is the right year for us to return capitals.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I would think you're looking at your business as well to how much capital you think you need to hold to run your business. Can you talk to what you think those numbers are over time?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Vikram Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Well, I think some of that is -- let us start the other way. A lot of that is the decline in Citi Holdings and the risk that goes down through that. And that's a continual process. We're still in the process of selling a couple of businesses there, that should take risk down. We've got assets in SAP that are going to come down, as well. And so when you look at risk weighted assets coming down, that's going to be the biggest contributor. And we've said in the past that some of that would like to reinvest in building out Citicorp, although that depends on how and where the opportunities to help our clients are going to be. So that is part of our thinking in what drives us to say what John Gerspach said earlier, that if 8% to 9% is the kind of range we're on in Basel III, 2012 is the year that we ought to be able to achieve that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So did you ask for capital action in your proposal to regulators?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Vikram Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Well, we can't tell you what we say with our regulators and what they say to us. But what I can tell you is what I've said, again, 2012 is the year we think we'll have the ability to return capital, of course, based on our discussion with our regulators.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">On Retail Partner Card, I noticed that you retained the Zales account. Would you be able to bring Retail Partner Cards from Citi Holdings into Citicorp before those marketing agreements are up? Or would it be a rebidded marketing agreement, you win, you keep them in Citicorp? How should I think about that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Vikram Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Well, I think the way to -- let's start with the very big picture. The Card business is very different than when we moved the partner cards into the Citi Holdings, and that is a consideration that we are well aware of. Having said that, the biggest consideration for us is to run the partner cards in a very optimal way and Zales is an indication of that because there's a lot of franchise value in that, and there's a lot of value in that particular business and we're building that out. We've done nothing to change our view, that is still in Citi Holdings and that remains a driving concern. But I'll also tell you that as with everything we've done through Citi Holdings, our primary goal still continues to be we won't do anything with assets that's not in our shareholders interest and we have clearly that in mind. And that is not going to be impacted by which portfolio we have or how it turns over or any of that. It really comes down to the kind of value we think that Card business represent to us and we want to recognize it for you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So if it's positive, you would bid for it? If you think there's going to be an accretion to your...</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Vikram Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Again, what I would say on that is we haven't changed our mind, it's still in Holdings and it is still part of the assets that we want to rationalize. But obviously, as we do that, we will look at every other option before we make a decision.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And then last on ROA outlook. Vikram, in the past, you have talked about what your ROA outlook is for Citicorp. Has there been any change to that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Vikram Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">We're still exactly where we said we were before and, if you look at how Citicorp is growing, the International Consumer business has done well. We also think the GTS business with the book of business we're building, especially as interest rates change, will start showing some of that through as well. So when you put all of that together and, really, the change in the business models in our Securities and Banking business, we think all of that still takes us back to 1.25, 1.5 on assets that we ought to be able to recognize on a longer-term basis. And of course, interest rate environments are also important in terms of where and how we get to that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Higher rates is a function of your $125 million to $150 million?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Vikram Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I think we've said that, that's a kind of business that should be able to earn 1.25 and 1.5 in much more of a normalized environment. And normalized we were talking about is, of course, credit taking account but as credit changes, that's one of the factors and got to say interest rates are another factor, too.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John McDonald - Bernstein Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I wanted to try to just ask Betsy's question on the capital just maybe on a slightly different angle. The question comes up a lot on investor conversations. I guess what we struggle with is, you're at the high end of peers on all the capital ratios and most of the other big banks are talking about kind of a medial hopes of capital deployment. So as we look at it, we kind of ask a question to what degree is perhaps Citigroup is being conservative? Or is your implementation of the various Bassels more complicated or less certain to the international aspect of your businesses? Could you help us get a little closer to reconciling that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Vikram Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Let me take a crack and then, John, will add to that as well. I think the first part, I would say, is that for us or anybody else, some of the definitional issues still have to be worked through. A lot of the measurement issues are still going to have to be worked through and we've said in the past and I'll say again, we think 2011 is a year where a lot of those details get worked out. That's an important part to it. And the second part of that is that we do want to manage our business in a prudent way, which is why we said we want to carry a cushion. And putting all of those things into account, we think its prudent to think about returning capital in 2012.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John McDonald - Bernstein Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And is there any international aspect of the business changes the Basel implementation or is that just getting too deep?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Vikram Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">No, there are no systematic issues other than those that are generic for everybody.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John McDonald - Bernstein Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">John, quick question on the tangible book value impacts. Could you just walk through how the AOCI and maybe the DTA, if there are any impact affected the tangible book value this quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">You take a look at the other comprehensive income, the AOCI, as you say. Two big drivers there. One would be losses on the AFS Securities. That was about $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion of a negative. And then we had a positive pick up on the currency translation adjustment that was worth about $400 million going the other way.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John McDonald - Bernstein Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And then regarding regulatory capital ratios and DTA to recapture, now that you've been profitable for a few quarters, what's needed to allow for the consumption of DTA to where your regulatory capital might grow faster than your net income at some point?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">The single largest driver would be net income in our North America operations. When you take a look at the breakdown of the DTA, we ended the quarter with DTA of about $52 billion. $5 billion of that is state and local, $5 billion of that is international, so $42 billion is really U.S. federal tax. And the single largest driver there is generating more profits in North America.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John McDonald - Bernstein Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So geographic mix, really. Last thing is on revenue form question. Do you have any initial thoughts on the potential changes in the methodology for calculating FDIC premiums or so-called tester amendment?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I'm sorry, do I have any what?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John McDonald - Bernstein Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Have you done any calculations that you could share or any thoughts on how that change in the FDIC methodology might affect you in 2011 or '12?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Well, what we've said is that, at least from the impacts of Dodd-Frank that are measurable right now, the change in FDIC assessment is the single largest impact on us. We don't have much of an impact on debit card interchange or overdraft fees. Those are really small impacts on us. But the way that the FDIC has proposed changing its formula will impact all the large banks dramatically -- have a greater dramatic impact on the large banks than it will on the small banks. So our assessment right now is based upon the rules. We're looking at almost a doubling of the FDIC assessment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John McDonald - Bernstein Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Just from a '10, '11 absolute dollars doubling potentially?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Of course, it depends upon exactly when in '11 it goes into effect. So depending upon if it's a second quarter item than it would be three quarters. You can do the math.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John McDonald - Bernstein Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">John, can you just tell us where the DTA ended up and how much of that was allowable? I might have just missed it in the disclosure.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">We ended with about $52 billion of DTA and $35 billion of that was disallowed in coming up with our Tier 1 Common ratio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Harte with Sandler O'Neill.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Jeffrey Harte - Sandler O'Neill &amp; Partners L.P.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Bigger picture question. I mean, we look at all the data we're getting on kind of the emerging markets in the international franchise and it seems loans are growing, revenues are growing, credit seems okay, but there's a lot of things going on in the world from currencies to what's going on in Europe. Can you give us any sense on what you're seeing kind of on the ground with some of the emerging markets as far as the kind of near-term continuation of growth prospects?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Vikram Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Well, first of all, the emerging markets, that is a broad group. We know what's happening in certain areas. You see it in South Africa, you see it in China, which is the growth in inflation there. And especially those countries that don't have a flexible currency are seeing more of that and there is growth adjustment there, as a resultl of these changes. But I would say that the underlying dynamics of the consumers in these markets and the growth models actually finding a real kind of a solid development model has not really changed. And so we expect to see a continued increase in loan demand. We expect to see continued increase in capital markets activities. We expect to see continued growth, not only in the Asian markets, but also in the Latin American and some of the African markets. Some of the Eastern European markets are still linked to Europe and that is a longer process. But we remain constructive on the emerging markets, understanding that monetary tightening and other kind of breaks may have to be put on from time to time to manage the overheating that can occur and the inflation that occurs. I think the real question still keeps coming back to the U.S. economy, in our view, and what kind of growth you're going to see and what's going to happen to housing prices and it is still the largest economy in the world and that is going to be something the markets are going to have to watch over the next two, three quarters. And that's why I think, when I started, I said that the macro still going to dominate the micro here for the next two, three quarters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Jeffrey Harte - Sandler O'Neill &amp; Partners L.P.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Can you just maybe specifically comment a little bit on Mexico? That seems to be your biggest non-U.S. market now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Vikram Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Sure. I mean, I think first of all, you see our account activity is pretty strong in terms of account opening. Our loan growth continues there. We have seen the linkage between Mexico and the U.S. turnaround the GDP, and we still think that leverage is pretty powerful. And so if the U.S. economy starts doing better, you're going to start to see that in Mexico, as well. Everybody knows the more macro social issues that are occurring there. When you look at our mix of branches, we happen to be in a lot of the major sort of areas. We're everywhere obviously in Mexico but we feel that, given some of the social issues, we're in the right places for capturing the right kind of population there. And so I don't know if there's anything specific you had in mind, but we continue to be very constructive on our business in Mexico, and we're also expecting that business to continue to grow as a result of some of these fundamental turnarounds in the GDP numbers of the country.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Jeffrey Harte - Sandler O'Neill &amp; Partners L.P.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And then a little more detail. The equity trading in the quarter, I don't know if the press release cited derivatives activity in principal positions. In an environment where equity markets were up so much in most areas, I'm a little surprised to see principal positions be one of the drivers of the decline. Can you give us any more color on that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Vikram Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">No, I'm not going to go into the individual strategy that, that particular desk had employed. But as I said, it generated about $150 million of revenue in the third quarter and virtually $0 million in the fourth.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Christoph Kotowski - Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">If I could go back at the trading question a little bit. You said take a longer view of it and fixed income went from $21 billion in full year '09 to  $14 billion this year. I'm curious, is that kind of all geographies, all products? Or is it primarily the impact of the European peripheral country credit?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I wouldn't say that the European peripheral countries were a significant contributor to any of our trading results. So you can sort of take that one off the table. Again, when you take a look at the trading performance, first quarter '09, I think we all had the same thing. A very, very strong quarter in the first quarter of '09. And that one kind of -- that's going to be something that's going to be very difficult to replicate. And then each quarter sort of tends to tell its own story. As I mentioned, this quarter, our weaker trading was actually concentrated in the Rates and Currency business, particularly the G10 Rates business in fixed income. But there's no indication that there's anything systemic in those numbers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Christoph Kotowski - Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Was there an impact just from long rates rising during the quarter? Was that the primary impact?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">It's primarily associated with our market making activities as we were trying to facilitate client needs. And if clients were reacting to rising rates, then we were certainly on the other side of that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Vikram Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Let me put it the other way. If you're trying to read anything more systematic into it, there isn't. These are strong businesses, we've got very strong franchises in the local currency areas. As you know, we've got a very strong G10 business. We're building out our Equity business. So we actually remain very positive in terms of the amount and the size of our client, flow of client activity continues to be robust. If you put it all together, again, this is a business that we continue to believe it's going to be a big contributor going forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Christoph Kotowski - Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And then on the $255 million net interest income adjustment, is that something that we should think of as a one-time reserve or is that an ongoing item? Or how long does it go on for?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Well, again, the $255 million you are talking about is the adjustment that we made to build additional reserves for potential client refunds in our CFJ business. That's a reserve that we have adjusted periodically for four, five years now at this point in time. So again, as we see changes in the market this particular quarter, the build is really associated with what we thought might be an uptick in refund requests related to the talk of Fuji bankruptcy that occurred. So it was really in response to a specific event.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Christoph Kotowski - Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And then finally, your expense guidance, I believe, previously was $11.5 billion a quarter, give or take, and now we're at $12 billion to $12.5 billion. Should we assume that, that comes straight out of pre-provision earnings or do we expect revenue increases to offset that to at least some degree?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I've just got to correct you just a little bit, Chris. Going into 2010, our guidance was full year expenses of $48 billion to $50 billion. By the second half of the year, we said we thought individual quarters for the second half of 2010 would be $11.5 billion to $12 billion. So we really weren't at an $11.5 billion guidance. And so as we've look ahead to next year, again, we're just trying to be consistent with where we were, quite frankly at the beginning of last year, which is as we look at the overall year, it's $48 billion to $50 billion of total expense. We ended this year with $47.4 billion. So it's not all that much different.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Your next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Could you talk a little bit, maybe, about how you think about once you do get to capital return, how you think about the pace or mix as it relates to things like the shrinkage in the balance sheet from Citi Holdings and the like?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Vikram Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Moshe, that's an important question. The good news is we've got a few quarters to think about it. Because as we said before, this is a 2012 thing and, of course, the usual discussions will apply on stock repurchases versus dividends and all that kind of stuff, and sort of think we should pick up little bit later.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">On the proprietary trading commentary before, that wasn't that you changed the focus of the business. That was just the revenue output in the quarter, right, John?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">That's correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Your next question comes from the line of Ed Najarian with ISI Group.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Edward Najarian - ISI Group Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Maybe just two quick ones. Would you be willing to disclose some approximation of what your Bassel III based Tier 1 Common ratio is today? And then how would you advise us to think about the pace of shrink of Citi Holdings over the next 12 months?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">The first one, no, as I said, we're targeting to be at that 8% to 9% range in 2012. As far as the second, look, if you take a look at the assets that are left in Citi Holdings, and we laid them out for you in the deck, we're not likely to maintain the same pace that we had in 2010. Specifically, again, Brokerage and Asset Management which has got roughly $26 billion, $27 billion of assets, that's virtually all tied up in the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney joint venture. And so that's an event as opposed to something that we're going to just wind our way down over the next several quarters. Special Asset Pool is about $80 billion of assets now. We've taken that down dramatically. But now, roughly a third of the remaining Special Asset Pool assets are hold to maturity assets. And so the pace of the reduction in the Special Asset Pool is also going to slow because we just don't have as much inventory, quite frankly, push out. And then you get to the last component and the Local Consumer Lending and more than half of the remaining assets are tied up in U.S. mortgages. And I don't see a big one-time sale of U.S. mortgages. We will continue to sell down assets at a pace, but it's not likely that we're going to find a $20 billion to $30 billion sale on our doorstep at any sort of rational terms in the near-term. So the pace is going to slow from where we've been in 2010 .</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Edward Najarian - ISI Group Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And then, obviously, as we get to the end of this quarter, you get some sense from the regulators, we think, in terms of what your discussions with regulators are, what they come back to you with in terms of your capital planning. Do you expect to give us more detail on capital planning and on your Bassel III base Tier 1 Common ratio when you report first quarter earnings and will be enabled at that time?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Ed, that's kind of unlikely. I mean, unless we significantly change our position as to our view towards 2012 being the year that we'd be looking to return capital, it's not likely that we'd be changing anything else.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">In November, Citi gave a presentation where you guys said you'll increase investment spending for consumer by $3 billion to $4 billion over the next three years. And can you give us more color when we should see that hit? How much a hit this quarter? I know you said $150 million of the linked quarter increase was due to increased investments and volume related matters, so I'm guessing it hasn't really hit yet. And how much of your expense guidance for the year includes some of this additional investment spending?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yes, the $3 billion to $4 billion still holds. We actually have been, or have begun, that investment spending, and I think we mentioned the fact that as early as the first quarter of this year of 2010, we had some elements of it in place. Although it certainly picked up pace as we got later into the year. When you look at the fourth quarter, Mike, I mentioned $150 million being the linked quarter-on-quarter impact of investment spending, it's safe to say that something on the order of $300 million to $400 million of our expense base in the fourth quarter represented investment spending.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">That we should see that increase by another $2.6 billion over the next three years?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Well, $3 billion to $4 billion would be the total amount of spending.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">So you got a run rate now of $1.2 billion?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">That's about it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">So you have another $2 billion more for this investment spending, is that fair to say?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Well, if you're at a run rate of $1.2 billion for a quarter, for a year, I should say, that would mean that over something like three years then, you would be within that $3 billion to $4 billion range, right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">So this is just a one-time step up and you maintain that higher level?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Exactly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And then separately, it came out last week that you have an MOU with the regulators. How big a deal is this in your mind? Is it simply backwards looking for some of the problems from a couple of years ago or is this still something you need to wrestle with? You highlighted some risk management issues that you still had to resolve.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Mike, as you probably well know, we can't comment on any conversations that we have with our regulators.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And then a separate question would be, for the DTAs you earned $10 billion last year on GAAP earnings, but the DTA level still went up to $52 billion as you pointed out. In layman's terms, why does the DTA keep going up even while you have positive GAAP earnings? I know you mentioned some of that is geography, but what are some of the other reasons why it still goes up?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Well, the biggest impact for us was the adoption of 166, 167 in the first quarter. That added $4.3 billion, $4.4 billion to the DTA asset.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">But it's still leaking upward here even in the past couple of quarters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Don't forget then, also, besides earnings, you've got the impact of the AFS portfolio, we had losses on the AFS portfolio this quarter. I mentioned that in response to another question. When you think about driving down the DTA, the key component for us is actually to reduce the amount of the DTA that's represented by net operating loss carry forwards. And we've actually taken that down during the year. We started the year with, I think just a little bit north of $5 billion of NOL carry forward. And we'll end the year with about $2.3 billion, maybe $2.2 billion of NOL carry forward. And so once we work our way through that and actually in the Q, I believe the third quarter Q, we actually gave you disclosure that our expectation is that we will be through the NOL carry forward during 2011. And once we work our way through that, then it'll become easier to deal with the foreign tax credit carry forwards, which are the largest piece of our DTA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And then last question for Vikram, you lead off the conference call saying macro trends should dominate micro trends the next couple of quarters. I was just curious why you mentioned the next couple quarters in particular?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Vikram Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Well, look, I think we're all, I said the next few quarters, now it could be a couple of quarters, but let me say that, again, we've got to watch what happens in the U.S. and that's still the biggest economy. We see a lot of constructive signs. Credit seems to be getting better, as well. But we want to see employment rise. We want to see GDP grow correctly. And these are all going to be important things. If at some point, though, the economy feels like whatever the rate it is at, it's more stable and recovering and is on a trajectory, that takes down a little bit of the uncertainty in the marketplace. And of course, I'm also hoping the next two, three quarters shed some more light in some of the leverage related issues in Europe, as well. And so it just feels to us that when you look at the world and the growth in the emerging markets, when we look at kind of what's going on in Europe and the U.S. that these next few quarters are going to be really important. Now that's not a prediction, that's just a perspective.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Your next question comes from the line of Carole Berger with Soleil Securities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Carole Berger</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">My question is really on foreign exchange. You mentioned in a couple of places how expenses were impacted by exchange rates, but you didn't mention anywhere where revenues were similarly impacted. Are there places where you are not matched, in terms of where your revenues and expenses are coming from?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I didn't catch the last question. Are we appropriately matched? The impact on revenues and expenses has got less to do with matching assets and liabilities. I mean, the assets and liabilities. . .</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Carole Berger</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I meant in terms of, you mentioned a couple of places where expenses were up because of the exchange rates. And my question is, why aren't revenues also up because of. . .</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And I think in some of the commentary that we gave you, on the international, Regional Consumer Banking franchises, we've mentioned that FX changes drove some of the revenue increase. The revenue was up about 4% and FX probably drove more than half of that. But when you take a look at all of our businesses, we operate in many different currencies around the world. And so FX, overall, has really got a very small impact on our bottom line. And it tends to work its way out as far as revenues expense and NCLs. But when you get into individual lines, FX can be a driver of variance, just in those individual lines.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Carole Berger</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And my second question was, is there any reason -- you said that 19% of your assets remained in holding. Is there any reason to believe that a greater proportion of those assets are risk weighted? In other words, are more than 19% of your risk-weighted assets in holding?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Yes, and Carole, as a matter of fact, what we've done in the past, we indicated at the end of June that the risk-weighted assets in Citi Holdings represented about 40% of our risk-weighted assets, at that point in time. We then, in September, told you that Citi Holdings risk-weighted assets were down to 37% of our total risk-weighted assets. And by the end of the year, our current estimate is, that the Citi Holdings risk-weighted assets will be about 34% of our total risk-weighted assets. So think in terms of Citi Holdings representing 19% of our GAAP assets and roughly estimated 34% of our risk-weighted assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Your next question comes from the line of it Richard Bove with Rochdale Securities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Richard Bove - Punk Ziegel</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I'd like to ask you the same question I asked JPMorgan but in the opposite direction. They've got a negative federal funds plus cash position when divided by assets. You now have roughly 12.9% of your balance sheet on the asset side in cash, plus a positive net fed funds position. Why is it so big? I mean, you're only getting about a 79 basis point return on that money, which must be having an impact on your net interest margin. Could you kind of give me your thinking on this?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Well, you're right, we do have a lot of cash on the balance sheet and in response to one of the earlier questions, we touched on the fact that there's actually been a decline in our available-for-sale securities during the quarter as we've begun to reposition that portfolio, given the current rate environment. So a little bit of the incremental cash that we have on the books right now is really being driven just because we're in the midst of repositioning that AFS portfolio debt.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Richard Bove - Punk Ziegel</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">If we go back in time, that percentage should be somewhere around 3% or 4% and it would be because, generally speaking, Citigroup always had a negative federal funds position, it's almost shocking to see it with a $57 billion of a net positive federal funds position. And cash has never been this high as a percentage of assets. So one might argue that on a ratio basis, you're 3x higher as a percentage of assets than you would normally be. So just selling off some securities last quarter had no real impact on what I'm talking about.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">As we entered 2010, we comment on the fact that we were deliberately liquid at that point in time and we felt that it was prudent to remain liquid throughout 2010. That gives us a certain amount of flexibility for two things. One, clearly, as our debt now begins to mature and we do have debt sizable amounts of our long-term debt maturing during 2011, we'll have less of a need to roll over that debt. So one of the things that you'll see is our long-term debt begin to go down. That will consume some of that cash. The second is, we are open for business and we're looking to build the loan book in both our Consumer and our Corporate businesses. And so our expectation is that we'll begin to put some of that liquidity to work in 2011.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Richard Bove - Punk Ziegel</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">So it's fair to state that if you start to utilize that excess cash to lend, and if your loan to deposit ratio starts to move up, I'm going to say, again, to more normal levels, that this represents tremendous excess earnings capacity at the moment?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Yes, our deposit to loan ratio, I'd like to say I tend to think that the other way right now is about 139% or 140%. That's higher than we would expect to be in a long-term basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Jao with Cowen.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Andrea Jao - Cowen and Company, LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">First on trading equities and on the fixed income and equities trading businesses, have there been changes in your appetite for taking risk or committing capital as you facilitate customer transactions? Then I have a follow-up regarding the balance sheet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">No, there's been no change in our appetite.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Andrea Jao - Cowen and Company, LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">How should I think about the balance sheet by the  end of 2011? Just thinking back to the previous question by Dick, excess liquidity will be replaced by higher loans and less borrowings. How about deposits in your securities book?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">I think you asked about deposits. We, right now, again, given where we are from a liquidity point of view, we obviously will be there for our customers to accept deposits, but one of the things that we're focused on right now is addressing, I'm going to call it the quality and the pricing of our deposits. So we are deliberately shifting out of pricing to capture time deposits. And I think you've seen some of the beginnings of that in some of the ships in our interest-bearing deposits, both in the U.S. and in our branches outside the U.S. That's reflected on the face of the balance sheet right now. So we'll look to maintain steady deposits, but try to improve the mix.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back to Mr. John Andrews.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>John Andrewas</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Thank you, everyone, for committing so much time this morning on a rather lengthy call. Obviously, this will be available for replay on the website later this afternoon and if you have follow-up questions, contact to the IR team here at Citi.

Thank you very much for joining us today. As you know, last year was our first year of profitability since the financial crisis and we continue to make progress in 2011. We earned $3 billion this quarter, more than double what we earned last quarter. Revenues were up 7% and expenses were down 1%. The environment has been challenging, low interest rates are compressing spreads and we continue to carry large amounts of liquidity. But we believe this is a cyclical, not a secular issue. Our core businesses performed well despite the environment, with Citicorp earning $4.1 billion for the quarter and Citicorp Consumer and Corporate loans grew on a combined basis by 10% year-over-year, and pretax earnings in Citicorp were almost evenly split between the emerging and developed markets, reflecting our deep roots in the 160 countries where we do business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">On the Institutional side, our client business in Securities and Banking was strong, although down from one year ago. Revenues in lending, equities and Fixed Income rebounded strongly from the previous quarter. Client activity in our Global Transaction Services was also strong. We had higher transaction volumes, deposits, trade finance loans and we have a strong pipeline going forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">In both U.S. and international Consumer Banking, net income was up from the last quarter and the first quarter of 2010. Net credit losses declined 31% from the first quarter last year. Internationally, average deposits and loan increased 13% and 14%, respectively, from a year ago and credit trends continue to improve. Throughout our franchise, we are focused on adding high performance assets and we remain very selective about the assets we put on our books.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We continue to divest non-core assets in Citi Holdings, with a $22 billion decrease in the first quarter, total assets in Holdings stand at $337 billion, down from 33% from one year ago. Citi Holdings assets are now at about 17% of our total balance sheet. And losses in Citi Holdings, this quarter, the loss was $608 million, down from 31% from the prior year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">These results helped improve our financial strength. Our Tier 1 Common ratio increased to 11.3% and our tangible book value increased to $4.69 per share, up $0.24 per share from last quarter and up 15% from a year ago. We're also building for the future. We're making substantial investments in our businesses in Citicorp. In the first quarter, investments exceeded $500 million, including technology, branches, marketing and new corporate and investment banking hires. In addition, we're building our Commercial Banking business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Lastly, we announced a 1-for-10 reverse stock split, to be effective on the morning of May 9. We also announced our intention to reinstate a dividend of $0.01 per share in the second quarter. These are meaningful steps as we anticipate returning capital to our shareholders next year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We will continue to execute on our strategy with discipline, reduce assets in Holdings and invest in key markets in our core businesses. I believe that we've demonstrated that we're consistently profitable and we're now focused on responsible growth.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Let me turn it over to John Gerspach and we'll come back and answer questions at the end.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Thank you, Vikram, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 2, Citigroup reported first quarter net income of $3 billion or $0.10 per diluted share versus $0.15 in the first quarter of 2010. This quarter's results included a $709 million net pretax loss on the transfer of certain securities in the Special Asset Pool from held to maturity to Trading Assets, which I'll discuss later. We also saw a negative CVA [credit value adjustments] of $256 million from Citi spreads tightening compared to a positive $308 million last year. Revenues of $19.7 billion were down 22% versus the first quarter of 2010 due primarily to lower securities and banking revenues, declining assets in Citi Holdings and the loss on the asset transfer. Expenses were up 7% year-over-year to $12.3 billion, driven by higher investment spending, volume-related costs, the impact of foreign exchange, and higher legal and related costs, all of which were partially offset by continued productivity savings and declining expenses in Citi Holdings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Net credit losses declined for the 7th consecutive quarter to $6.3 billion, 25% lower than the first quarter of 2010. We also released $3.3 billion of net loan loss reserves compared to a $53 million net release last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Turning now to Citicorp and Citi Holdings on Slide 3. Citicorp reported revenues of $16.5 billion and net income of roughly $4 billion in the first quarter. Results were lower than the first quarter of 2010, which benefited from a stronger trading environment. We continued to show progress in growing Citicorp with loans up 10% year-over-year, including 6% growth in consumer and 16% growth in corporate loans. Citi Holdings reported revenues of $3.3 billion and a net loss of $608 million. Citi Holdings ended the quarter with $337 billion of assets, down $22 billion during the quarter and down $166 billion year-over-year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Now on Slide 4, we show a 9 quarter trend for Citicorp's results. Excluding CVA, Citicorp's revenues were $16.7 billion, down 8% versus the prior year and up 9% sequentially, driven by higher Fixed Income and Equity Markets revenues versus the fourth quarter. Operating expenses of $9.6 billion were up 12% versus the prior year, more than half of the increase was due to higher investment spending. The remainder was roughly split between the impact of foreign exchange and inflation, and higher legal and related costs. Higher volume-driven expenses were offset by continued productivity savings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Citicorp's net credit losses were $2.3 billion, down 26% from the prior year, driven by Citi-Branded Cards in North America. We released $1.3 billion in net loan loss reserves, up from $367 million last year, mostly due to higher net releases in Citi-Branded Cards and the corporate portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Excluding CVA, earnings before taxes of $6 billion declined 12% year-over-year and were up over 50% from the prior quarter. Citicorp continued to benefit from a strong emerging market franchise in the first quarter as shown on Slide 5. Excluding CVA, emerging markets contributed 44% of Citicorp's revenues and over 50% of earnings before taxes in the first quarter. We have generated year-over-year growth in emerging markets revenues for 4 consecutive quarters, driven by both our consumer and institutional businesses. This growth reflects consistent strength in underlying business drivers, with average deposits up 8% year-over-year and loans up 20%. While expenses have grown as we ramped up investments in these regions, we have also benefited from credit improvement as emerging markets recovered earlier than developed markets. As a result, while increasing our investments, we also maintained year-over-year earnings growth in emerging markets in each quarter of 2010 and the first quarter of 2011.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Slide 6 shows results for our North America Consumer Banking business. Revenues of $3.3 billion were down 12% versus last year, mainly due to a decline in average loans and the impact of CARD Act. Expenses were up 4% year-over-year to $1.7 billion, as we continued to invest largely through higher marketing and technology spending. Credit costs declined 63% from last year to $797 million. Net credit losses were down 33% to $1.4 billion, driven by Citi-Branded cards, and the reserve release was $649 million this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Net credit margin grew by 15% year-over-year to $1.9 billion. Sequentially, total accounts remained stable in the first quarter of 2011, while card purchase sales reflected a seasonal decline versus the fourth quarter. On a year-over-year basis, card purchase sales were up slightly on a smaller account base, reflecting 4% growth in sales per account.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to our international Consumer Banking businesses on Slide 7. International revenues were $4.6 billion in the first quarter, up 8% year-over-year, driven by growth in Asia and Latin America. Revenue growth reflects both an improvement in underlying drivers, as well as a benefit from foreign exchange, partially offset by spread compression. We also had a $70 million charge to revenues for the anticipated repurchase of certain securities sold in Asia. Year-over-year, average deposits and loans grew by 13% and 14%, respectively.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Investment sales were up 5% versus last year and card purchases grew 20%. Expenses were $2.8 billion in the first quarter, up 18% versus last year, with roughly 1/3 of the increase due to the impact of foreign exchange and inflation. The remainder primarily reflects higher investment spending and volume related costs, partially offset by the continued productivity savings. Credit costs of $493 million were down 33% versus last year, driven by a decline in net credit losses. Higher revenues and the lower net credit losses resulted in net credit margin expansion again in the first quarter, up 16% year-over-year to $3.9 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On Slide 8, we show revenue growth trends for international Consumer Banking in more detail. Sequentially, we have grown average loans and deposits every quarter for 2 years and we saw progress again this quarter in card purchase sales and investment sales. These trends reflect the economic environment in these regions, as well as the results of our investment spending. With growing revenues and improving credit costs, we have increased our net credit margin year-over-year for 6 consecutive quarters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Slide 9 shows our Securities and Banking business. Excluding CVA, revenues of $6.2 billion were down 19% from the first quarter of last year, driven primarily by Fixed Income Markets. In Investment Banking, revenues were down $206 million to $851 million, primarily driven by lower debt underwriting. x CVA, equity market revenues were down 9% versus last year to $1.1 billion. Cash equity revenues and client volumes grew year-over-year, but were more than offset by lower trading revenues on principal positions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Fixed Income Market revenues, x CVA, were down 22% year-over-year to $4 billion. While client volumes remained strong, trading revenues on market making activities were lower versus 2010, reflecting, in part, tighter bid-offer spreads across most trading products, as additional liquidity entered the markets since last year. On a sequential basis, total markets revenues for equities and fixed income were up 64% in the first quarter, driven by higher volumes across most products and a more favorable trading environment versus the fourth quarter. Lending revenues were $244 million, flat versus last year. Private Bank revenues, excluding CVA, were up 5% year-over-year to $520 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Total operating expenses of $3.8 billion were up 11% from last year, roughly half of the increase was due to the absence of a litigation reserve release in the first quarter of 2010. The remainder mostly reflects investment spending and higher volume related costs, partially offset by productivity savings. Credit costs were a benefit again in the first quarter as net credit losses were more than offset by net reserve releases in the corporate portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Moving to Transaction Services on Slide 10. Revenues of $2.6 billion were up 5% from the first quarter of last year, driven by growth in Asia and Latin America. Treasury and Trade Solutions was up 3% on higher trade revenues and increased deposits, partially offset by spread compression. Securities and Fund Services grew 9% year-over-year, driven by higher volumes. Overall transaction volumes and new mandates remained strong across both businesses during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Asset growth was driven by trade finance, with average trade assets up over 80% from last year. Average deposits grew 11% to $355 billion and assets under custody were up 10% to $13 trillion. Expenses of $1.3 billion were up 14% versus last year, reflecting higher volumes and continued investment to grow the business, partially offset by productivity savings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Slide 11 shows Citi Holdings assets. We ended the quarter with $337 billion in Citi Holdings or 17% of total Citigroup assets. The $22 billion reduction in the first quarter was comprised of over $7 billion of asset sales and business dispositions, approximately $13 billion of net runoff and pay downs, and $1.3 billion of net cost of credit and net asset marks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On Slide 12, we provide more details on the transfer of nearly $13 billion of assets in the Special Asset Pool from held-to-maturity to trading. The majority of these securities had originally been classified as available-for-sale, and they were transferred to held-to-maturity in the fourth quarter of 2008. We have moved the securities to trading assets, allowing us to sell them as a mitigating action in anticipation of adopting Basel III. These $13 billion of securities would have had a disproportionately higher Basel III risk weighting compared to the remainder of the City Holdings assets. The transfer resulted in a net $709 million pretax charge to revenues resulting from the recognition of $1.7 billion in net pretax losses, which were previously reflected in OCI, partially offset by $946 million of mark-to-market and realized gains. OCI increased by $1 billion, representing the reversal of net unrealized losses after tax. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">To date, we have sold nearly 75% of these assets at prices generally at or above our marks. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On Slide 13, we show a 9 quarter trend for Citi Holdings results. We narrowed the loss in Citi Holdings again this quarter to $608 million. Revenues were down 50% year-over-year to $3.3 billion due to declining assets, lower positive marks in the Special Asset Pool and the loss on the asset transfer this quarter. Expenses of $2 billion were down 22% versus last year and total credit costs were down 64% to $2.1 billion. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Looking at the Citi Holdings in more detail on Slide 14, revenues in Brokerage and Asset Management were $137 million this quarter, down from the first quarter of 2010, which included gains on the sale of Habitat and Colfondos. In Local Consumer Lending, revenues were down 32% versus last year to $3.2 billion, driven by declining loan balances, a higher mortgage repurchase reserve build and a higher refund reserve build related to our Consumer Finance business in Japan. In the Special Asset Pool, revenues were a negative $7 million in the first quarter, down significantly from last year due to lower positive revenue marks and the $709 million loss on the asset transfer. Credit costs were down 64% year-over-year to $2.1 billion as credit costs continued to improve in both the consumer and corporate portfolios. Total net credit losses were down 25% to $4 billion as lower consumer net credit losses were partially offset by higher corporate losses. Credit losses in the Special Asset Pool more than doubled year-over-year to $670 million, reflecting higher costs of loan sales and higher net credit losses on loans for which we had previously established specific FAS 114 reserves, which were then released during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We released $2.1 billion of net loan loss reserves in Citi Holdings in the first quarter, nearly half of which was attributable to the corporate portfolio. Local Consumer Lending continues to drive the earnings performance of Citi Holdings with nearly $600 million of net loss for the quarter. Within Local Consumer Lending, the net loss was mostly attributable to the mortgage portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Slide 15 shows the results for the Corporate/Other segment. Revenues declined by $410 million versus last year, reflecting lower investment yields and net losses on hedging activities. Net income also reflects higher operating expenses during the quarter. Expenses were up by $356 million versus last year, mainly due to legal and related costs. Assets of $281 billion include approximately $80 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $146 billion of liquid available-for-sale securities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Slide 16 shows total Citigroup net credit losses and loan loss reserves. NCLs [net credit losses] continued to improve in the first quarter, down 9% sequentially to $6.3 billion. And the net LLR [loan loss reserves] release grew nearly 50% to $3.3 billion. We ended the quarter with $36.6 billion of total loan loss reserves and our LLR ratio was 5.8%. Consumer NCLs declined 12% sequentially to $5.4 billion and we released $2 billion in net loan loss reserves. Corporate credit was a benefit of $520 million in the first quarter compared to $256 million last quarter. Corporate net credit losses grew 28% sequentially to $849 million, driven by charge-offs for loans for which we had previously established specific reserves, which were then released during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We released $1.4 billion of net corporate loan loss reserves in the first quarter, up from $920 million in the fourth quarter. Corporate nonaccrual loans of $5.5 billion were down 36% versus the prior quarter, the majority of which was attributable to EMI.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Moving to consumer credit trends on Slide 17. As I mentioned, consumer net credit losses of $5.4 billion were down 12% sequentially due primarily to North America cards. Our net credit loss ratio declined again this quarter to 4.9% and our loan loss reserve ratio was 7.5%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Slide 18 shows our International Consumer credit trends. In Citicorp, NCLs continued to improve on both a dollar and a rate basis in the first quarter, while dollar delinquencies grew in some markets as we continued to grow our international loans. In Asia, India continued to show the most significant improvement in net credit losses. For the region, 90-plus day delinquencies were flat, but down as a percentage of loans. In Latin America, net credit losses continued to improve, driven by Mexico cards. And our 90-plus day delinquencies improved on a rate basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On Slide 19, we showed Citi-Branded Cards in Citicorp and Retail Partner Cards in Citi Holdings. Credit trends for both portfolios continued to improve. In Citi-Branded Cards, NCLs declined for the fourth consecutive quarter. NCLs decreased by 19% sequentially to $1.4 billion and 90-plus day delinquencies were down 10% to $1.4 billion. In Retail Partner Cards, NCLs were down for the 7th consecutive quarter. NCLs decreased by 18% sequentially to $1.1 billion and 90-plus day delinquencies declined by 19% to $1.3 billion. For both portfolios, early stage delinquencies also showed improvement on both a dollar and a rate basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On Slide 20, we show the North America mortgage portfolio in Citi Holdings, split between Residential 1st Mortgages and Home Equity Loans. 90-plus day delinquencies in both portfolios improved again this quarter. In Residential 1st Mortgages, we ended the quarter with $76 billion of loans, down 21% from a year ago. Sequentially, 90-plus day delinquencies declined by 18% to $4.5 billion and were down more than 50% from last year. Net credit losses increased slightly from the fourth quarter due to lower recoveries, but were down 26% versus a year ago. The sequential decline in first mortgage delinquencies was mostly due to asset sales and trial mods [modifications] converting to permanent modifications. During the first quarter, we sold $1.1 billion in delinquent mortgages. Over the past eight quarters, we have converted $5.3 billion of trial mods to permanent modifications. More than three quarters of these trial modifications were HAMP and we continued to experience re-default rates on HAMP-modified loans of less than 15%. The remainder were modified under other Citi programs. And to date, the re-default rate on these modifications has been less than 25%. In North America real estate lending and Citi Holdings, our total loan loss reserves represent two years of coincident NCL coverage.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Slide 21 shows the trend in our key capital metrics. We ended the quarter with a Tier 1 Capital ratio of 13.3% and a Tier 1 Common ratio of 11.3%. Our GAAP assets declined 3% year-over-year, while we reduced our risk-weighted assets by 7% to $990 billion. Citi Holdings represents roughly 31% of our total risk-weighted assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So in summary, the first quarter showed continued execution of our strategy. While Securities and Banking faced a less favorable environment as compared to the first quarter of 2010, our markets business grew significantly from the fourth quarter, with robust client activity across Fixed Income and Equities. Year-over-year, we generated strong growth in both international Consumer Banking and Transaction Services. Importantly, we accomplished these results in a challenging environment as low interest rates continued to compress spreads.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We continued to invest in Citicorp and we are seeing results across our major business drivers, including loans, deposits, transaction volumes and card purchase sales.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">In Citi Holdings, we ended the quarter with $337 billion of assets, representing 17% of total Citigroup. Assets were down by 1/3 from a year ago and Citi Holdings expenses declined by 22%. Credit remained a significant contributor to earnings in the first quarter, as net credit losses continued to decline particularly in North America cards.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">During the quarter, we grew our tangible book value per share by $0.24 to $4.69 per share, and our Tier 1 Common ratio grew over 50 basis points to 11.3%. We also have over $36 billion of loan loss reserves. Based upon what we know today, we remain confident that we are on track to operate in the 8% to 9% Tier 1 Common range under Basel III in 2012. And assuming we have clarity on capital rules, we still expect to be in a position to begin returning capital to shareholders next year. Now, I'd like to discuss some factors that may affect our results for the remainder of 2011.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">In North America Consumer Banking, we continue to expect net credit margin to be primarily driven by improvement in net credit losses. As credit continues to improve, we will further increase our investments in the business. In international Consumer Banking, net credit margin is more likely to be driven by revenue growth, particularly in the second half of the year, as our investment spending should continue to generate volume growth to outpace spread compression. International credit costs are likely to begin to increase in 2011, reflecting a growing loan portfolio. In Local Consumer Lending in Citi Holdings, revenues should continue to decline given a shrinking loan balance resulting from pay downs and continued asset sales. However, as we've seen in the first quarter, the pace of decline in Citi Holdings assets has moderated. Regarding expenses, we continued to expect full year Citigroup expenses of $48 billion to $50 billion this year, with some variability across quarters as we continue investing in Citicorp, while rationalizing Citi Holdings. Certain expenses, particularly legal costs and the impact of foreign exchange will remain difficult to predict.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Now that concludes our review of the quarter. And Vikram and I will now open up the line for questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p7\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">John, just a question, follow up on the expense outlook that you just gave. Just to be clear, the FX and legal costs are difficult to predict, but those are included in your outlook of the $48 billion to $50 billion?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">They are included in the $48 billion to $50 billion based upon what we've seen to date. But, John, I can't predict where the dollar is going to trade against all the different local currencies for the remainder of the year. So again, if the dollar continues to decline, we may have to be outside that range.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. And in terms of regulatory costs, the higher FDIC expenses, is that baked into the guidance as well?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Well, we account for FDIC assessments as a contra revenue, and so that would not be part of our expense guidance, but that would be baked into what you would think about for a revenue performance for the balance of the year. Now if I can anticipate your next question, based upon the way we understand the assessments will be working, we anticipate that the additional FDIC tax on us would amount to an annual increase of about $550 million and we'll start reflecting that in our results in the second quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. The question on Corporate/Other, I'm just kind of wondering longer term, do you think Corporate/Other will always be a net cost center or when you're not carrying as much a liquidity in legal expenses, should that have a modest positive contribution over time or too difficult to predict?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">I think that's a little difficult to predict. We tend to hold some expenses in Corporate/Other, some of the more significant legal expenses as we lay out for you when we have them. From a revenue point of view, Corporate/Other, it varies. Our hedging activities, over time, at least over the last several quarters, have tend to be somewhat on the negative. We carry some macro hedges in Corporate/Other, trying to address some fat-tail risks in some of our businesses, particularly Consumer business. So it's more likely to be negative, but the size of the negative pretax income should vary.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. And one just last follow-up on that. Just in terms of an expense rump from Holdings, is there a piece of unallocated expenses at Holdings that would come back to Citicorp after Holdings has wound down? Is there any way to help us think about sizing that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Well, we're actually very focused on what we would call stranded costs in Citi Holdings. And so as we wind down Citi Holdings, we're trying to eliminate all the costs in Citi Holdings and so that we end up with 0 stranded costs. So I think we've demonstrated a pretty good discipline doing that. You can pretty much track the decline in Citi Holdings expenses against their decline in assets. If you pull apart the decline in assets in the Special Asset Pool and Brokerage and Asset Management, our expenses as a percentage of assets in each of those businesses has held pretty steadily during the last 6 or so quarters. We had a slight uptick in expenses in local Consumer Lending against the assets and that's mostly reflective of additional expenses that we'd be incurring in our Mortgage business related to foreclosure activities, modifications, et cetera.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. But your goal is to not have any stranded costs once Holdings is completely wound down and that feels a reasonable goal to you?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">That is the goal.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Nomura.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So first one is just conceptual. On Slide 21, you showed that total risk weighted assets went up and I love the non-U.S. growth in loans, but all in, you had a little bit of shrinkage in loans, you shrunk Holdings as well. Is it fair to assume that the increase in risk-weighted assets is some form of ratings creep?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">No, it's not really ratings creep. If you just take a look at overall, our GAAP assets did grow from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. And we also -- so if you take a look at brokerage receivables, that was one of the accounts that sort of grew. So it really just reflects just the overall growth in the GAAP balance sheet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. And I appreciate the comments on operating and getting towards the 8% to 9% in 2012. Would you be able to tell us where you're at in a Basel III equivalent today because my guesstimation is somewhere around the 6% level which is doable, it means that you'd have to grow maybe 30 basis points from here to there per quarter, which seems about right.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yes. You know, Glenn, all I'm going to say is that we're -- as I've said in the prepared comments, we remain on track to be in that 8% to 9% range for Basel III next year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. In the appendix on Slide 35, you could look at what was transferred out and sold and it looks like mostly Alt-A and prime mortgages. And if that's correct, I'm just curious on what you're thinking in terms of housing in general. I mean you have less mortgage exposure than some other big banks, but you got some and you seem to be selling down those positions. Is that more risk-weighted asset commentary and mitigation or is it just as much a view of the markets in general?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I want to make sure I answer your question, so if I stumble a little bit, Glenn, get me back on track. Specific to the transfer in SAP, those obviously are assets that we -- since they're in Holdings, those are not core to us, we're looking to get rid of those assets. We had them originally in hold-to-maturity. The decision we reached on that transfer was solely Basel III related, just trying to -- again, as part of our staying on track to get to that 8% to 9% range for next year. These are assets, this $12.7 billion, these are assets that just had a disproportionately high risk weighting under Basel III. And so we took the opportunity this quarter to move them to a portfolio where we could get them off our books. So that's what's going on with the Holdings. Regarding our other mortgages in Citi Holdings in the real estate book, we continue to actively manage that. As I said, we've been active sellers of those mortgages over the last 5 quarters, the last 5 quarters, we've had something like $10 billion of sales out of the mortgage book, roughly $6 billion, I think it was a little bit slightly over $6 billion of that $10 billion was on delinquent loans. We continue to think that the best way to manage the severity risk that you have in that business is by selling delinquent mortgages. And so we are still active sellers of mortgages in that business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. Thank you for that. One last question on the NIM [net interest margin]. It came in 6 basis points and my gut is there's a bunch of, obviously, puts and takes. But as you have some of the Holdings wind down and some of the higher-yielding stuff runoff; I would think that's a natural effort or a natural runoff. However, at some other banks, you're seeing some mortgage extension help support the NIM. Just curious on what your efforts are behind the scene if it's on your mind that you need to support that or do you let it drift lower and actually the benefit is the derisking of the portfolio?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I'm going to probably demonstrate -- I'm probably going to disappoint a whole bunch of NIM-ites out there. I don't wake up in the morning and actively worry about what's going on with my NIM specifically. We're really trying to -- don't forget, NIM, when it comes to our trading books, NIM in a trading portfolio can be plus and minus and so it kind of varies all over the place. What we're focused on is executing the strategy that we put in place back in the beginning of 2008 and that is really managing the Holdings assets down. And you're right, as those assets runoff, that's going to put some pressure on our NIM because those are some higher earning assets. At the same point in time, I think now what you're seeing is you're seeing some good growth in the assets in Citicorp. We mentioned the fact that Citicorp loans grew 10% year-over-year. And we continue to see good growth coming out of our international Regional Consumer Banking businesses. The Latin America loans were up 17% year-over-year, loans in Asia were up 16% year-over-year. The spread that we get on those loans will gradually help to mitigate the NIM pressure that we're getting from winding down Citi Holdings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Bank of America.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Listen, just a follow-up on the NIM question for a second, I don't want to beat the horse to death. I appreciate that you don't wake up in the morning thinking about this. But last quarter, you gave us a near-term outlook and you came in just about exactly in line with that near-term outlook this quarter, so I guess I should ask the question again. Over the next quarter or two, what should we expect in terms of the directionality there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I think that we're going to have some pressure on NIM in the second quarter. The additional FDIC assessment that I mentioned in response to one of the earlier questions, we do account for that in our revenues. That does impact our NIM, so that will give us some downward impact. And we still have spreads that are under pressure. So it's not --- my expectation would be may be similar to this quarter as far as downward pressure.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">In terms of the downward pressure, so just sort of a continuation of that trend. And just to go back to the Citi Holdings...</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I do think about NIM every day. I just don't wake up thinking about it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Fair enough. Just to go back to the discussion on the Citi Holdings expense, I mean, it seems like a fairly chunky step function decline from the fourth quarter, notwithstanding a little bit of noise in the fourth quarter there, to the $2 billion run rate. Should we think of $2 billion as a run rate for the next few quarters before another step function? Or are you really going to try to manage it more downward gradually in line with the asset decline?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">It really -- as I said, the chunkiness will come as we do perhaps some of the larger property sales. I mean, to the extent that we could sell a business, that would obviously take, be a bit of a step function that comes down. Otherwise, the downward -- the decline in Citi Holdings expenses should pretty much track as the assets are coming off the books.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And can you update us on the attempts to sell CitiFinancial since you brought up the potential for asset sales there? And some of the press reports have indicated $13 billion, $14 billion of assets being discussed as part of that sale. Is that about the right order of magnitude?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">That's -- I'm not going to comment on the press reports. We did, as we mentioned earlier last year, restructure that business into a legacy portfolio that it would be more likely that we would retain in any type of sale. And then an asset portfolio that really goes with the ongoing business. So you're in the ballpark.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay, fair enough. And just a follow-up on the comments that you've made about FX driving a fairly meaningful portion of the expense structure increases. I mean, that's fair, but shouldn't it have a comparable impact on the revenues?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes, absolutely. When you take a look at FX impact overall, and that only has an impact on revenues, obviously it has got an impact on net credit losses as well. So if you want to think about the net impact of FX on Citicorp, net of the impact on revenues on expenses, on NCLs, FX changes added about $50 million, that's 5-0, of pretax earnings to Citicorp in the quarter. And then if you take a look at Citigroup, when you factor in the FX impact on some of the international NCLs and Holdings and the expenses in Holdings, it actually ends up being pretax neutral.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Finally, let me just ask one more question which is, if you can give us a sense for the costs that were carried in the P&amp;L this quarter to account for litigation stemming from foreclosures and loan repurchase and all of the like.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes, we've never commented exactly on the exact amount of accruals that we put up for foreclosure litigation as a matter. So we -- that's not something that we deliberately set aside. When you take a look at mortgage repurchases, we did set aside an additional $122 million this quarter for mortgage repurchase reserves and I think there's a page in the appendix of the supplement that, Page 29, that lays that out. So we added $122 million to the reserve and I think the reserve now stands at something like $940 million, $950 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay, great. Thanks very much for answering the questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Not a problem.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question comes from the line of James Mitchell with Buckingham Research.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>James Mitchell - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Two questions. Maybe one just on the DTA. If I do the math, it looks like you are essentially breakeven in North America. Is it fair to assume that the DTA was pretty flat or with reserve releases, there was some decline? How should we think about that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">James, the -- Jim, the DTA actually came down $1 billion this quarter, so the DTA reduced from $52 million down to $51 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>James Mitchell - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And that probably comes off the top of the Tier 1 Common, right? The deduction gets shrunk, right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes. In other words, the disallowed DTA against Tier 1 Common improved by roughly $1 billion, yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>James Mitchell - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. That's helpful, thanks. And just on the asset transfer again, maybe thinking about it a different way. Was it mostly, I guess, number one, mortgage-backed securities that were transferred, and is it fair to assume that a lot of those or the majority of those were below investment grade, so we can kind of back into what the risk weighted asset benefit would be?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We laid it out on Page 35, I mean, we didn't specify it completely, but you can see how securities that were under held-to-maturity accounting declined by  $13 billion in the quarter. And the asset transfer was $12.7 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>James Mitchell - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">No, Right. Understood. But in the detail on Trading Assets, you have corporate in there, you got auction rate securities and you got mortgages, obviously, those all have different risk weightings. I'm just trying to get a sense of how...</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">You can see on Page 35, the declines in the HTM [held to maturity] security should give you -- so in other words, corporates came down, corporate loans came down by $3.5 billion. prime and non-U.S. MBS [mortgage-backed securities] came down by $3.2 billion. Alt-A came down by $4.6 billion. All right? So that should give you a pretty good picture as to what's the components of the $12.7 billion were.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>James Mitchell - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Right. And we can probably assume that the mortgage backs were the highest risk weighted category?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">That would not be a bad assumption.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>James Mitchell - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. Fair enough. All right, thanks a lot.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question comes from the line of Ed Najarian with ISI Group.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Ed Najarian - ISI Group Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Most of my questions have been answered but just hopefully two more quick ones. You talked about, as you get into 2012 beginning to return capital. I was just wondering if you could give us any sense of your desire to focus more on dividends or buybacks. I'm thinking with the stock around tangible book or under tangible book, you'd be very focused on buybacks. But I wondered what your sense of that is?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Vikram Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Well, let me take a crack at that, Ed. I think, over time, we do want to get to some sort of a normalized dividend policy reflecting that we're really a higher growth bank than some of the -- many other large banks. So that is one goal we've got. And secondly, I don't disagree with you, with the stock trading below book value, it becomes awfully interesting to think about share repurchases as well, and I suspect, depending upon the kind of regulatory clarity we get, that our approach would be a combination of the two and it's a little early to talk about it as we found out, we all found out we need to wait for clarity from regulators before we move.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Ed Najarian - ISI Group Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">But at this point, other than saying it's a combination of the two, you can't give me a sense of preference for one versus the other as you start to return capital?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Vikram Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Again, as I said to you, I think our preference would be to do both and we want to all look at where the regulators come out. I do think that there are -- when you look at the shareholder base and when you look at kind of the signaling aspect of what one does, you've got to be mindful that our dividend policy is also important. Now I can't tell you that exactly how we will approach a normalized dividend policy yet. But don't get me wrong, we completely appreciate the value of the stock and the fact that it's trading below book value. That will be a significant influencer in our decision.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Ed Najarian - ISI Group Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. Thanks. And then just a quick follow-up, we're seeing, as we are seeing in the other big card banks, we're seeing your credit card losses continue to come down very rapidly. Both JPMorgan and BofA have given some outlook in terms of where they would expect card losses to go, say, over the next 12 months or on a sort of a more normalized basis. Are you willing to give us any sense of that? How much more of a decline we might see in card losses?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I think, obviously, we do believe that the credit -- assuming conditions stay where they are, credit losses should continue to improve. We're probably looking where, on a normalized basis, you think about our Cards business and I'm not going to tell you the time frame, but Branded Cards should be somewhere in the 5%, 5.5% range, maybe a little bit higher than 5.5% range, say, 5.5% range.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Ed Najarian - ISI Group Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. And anything on partner cards?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I really don't focus as much as on partner cards quite frankly since it's in Citi Holdings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Ed Najarian - ISI Group Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Right, okay. Okay, that's helpful. Thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer &amp; Co.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Christoph Kotowski - Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes, I wonder with -- in Asia and Latin America with a number of those economies raising interest rates and taking other steps to try to slow down what's been a very hot economy, your credit metrics still look good there, we saw a little uptick in the delinquencies in Latin America. But is it your expectation overall that you end up with a soft landing there and then continued growth or should one look for some significant deterioration in asset quality and portfolio loan growth slowdown in those markets?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">No, we're not anticipating a crash and burn scenario in those economies. They are -- there's a couple of them where they've got a high inflation rates. I think there's every evidence that the central bank in each of those countries is focused on that and they're all enacting policies to contain the inflation impact along with trying to also continue to promote their growth. There's a certain cycle that goes on in those economies and we're in one of those cycles right now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Vikram Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Don't also underestimate the reason why these economies over there -- it's part of a \"something's working\" kind of story in the sense, they are growing. Consumer incomes are rising. Consumers have more money to spend and so understanding that growth and inflation have to be traded off in the right way, we're here because something underlying in these economies is heading in the right direction and that's still our secular weave [ph].</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Christoph Kotowski - Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. And then as a follow-up, just was there any major fallout in Japan from the tsunami and all the subsequent turmoil and is there any ongoing impact on your business?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Quite frankly, the impact on us was somewhat muted. Now, I mean, the secondary effects, I guess, people are still trying to sort through. But specific to us, we took some trading hits the first couple of days after the tragedy. Those losses were pretty much recovered within a week or so. And the other significant impact that we saw in our CitiFinancial business in Japan, we do have a mortgage portfolio. We tried to isolate those mortgages that were located in the 5 prefectures that were most impacted by the tsunami. And so we put up an additional $55 million, $60 million worth of loan loss reserves against that. And we had some private equity investments that, again, they're in Holdings that we're looking to sell down and, I think, we took marks of maybe $30 million to $40 million on those things. So overall in the quarter, maybe $100 million worth of impact, all in Holdings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Christoph Kotowski - Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. All right. That's all for me, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">A couple of questions, one on the NIM. Could you just give us a little bit of a sense as to how the NIM is trajecting in the EM [emerging market] versus the DM [developed markets] space when you talk about the fact there's inflation in the EM side, how are you dealing with that and is that at all a net positive or a negative for you?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Betsy, I'm sorry, I really -- I don't have it in my head as far as how NIM is going EM versus DM. I apologize.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">We'll, I guess, the broader question is in the inflation oriented economies where you're invested, are you seeing an opportunity or a challenge as it relates to the profitability of those businesses?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">We absolutely see an opportunity. As I said, you can see the results of the investments that we've already begun to make in some of those countries as far as growth in loans and deposits. All of that should point to the fact that revenues should be doing quite nicely. The issue for us, you can see in just about every one of our International Consumer businesses, where we're benefiting as I said on those increased investment and the improvement in drivers. But each one of those businesses are contending with other factors at the present time. They're tending to mitigate the impact of the drivers on the top line. Latin America cards, for instance, if you take a look at what's going on in Latin America cards, we do have lower spreads on the new business and that is clearly had an impact on NIM. Year-over-year, our NIM in that business is down about 125 basis points. But a larger impact on the revenue dynamics in Latin America cards really results from the fact that we're still experiencing the effects of a repositioning in our Mexico cards portfolio. So Mexico cards represents about 40% of both our ANR and our revenue stream in Latin America cards. Now outside of Latin America, cards revenues are increasing year-on-year at 20%, while within Mexico, revenues have actually dropped 4% year-on-year. ANR outside of Mexico in Latin America is growing at 19%, while Mexico cards ANR grew 1%. Now we're actually encouraged by the fact that Mexico cards grew 1%. It actually demonstrates that we're kind of getting through that repositioning and so the impact of that repositioning is starting to abate. And as Mexico cards now begins to grow, I think, you're going to see a boost to the revenue growth in the region.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So volumes are beating spread, I guess, is the point. And I'm just wondering, from a NIM perspective, you indicated second quarter is going to be down a bit. When do you see the inflection point there? Is it going to be in the second half? Because in the past, you've talked about second half NIM going up?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I would say that we're looking towards the second half of the year for NIM to stabilize.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. And then second thing is on the 8% to 9% common Tier 1 next year, in your commentary, are you thinking about specific kind of actions, are specific actions included in your expectations that you're going to be at the 8% to 9%? In other words, are you incorporating into that comment, things like CitiFinancial getting sold and other potential assets that you might have in the docket to be sold? Or is that just from organic changes in the current business model?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Betsy, it basically reflects our continuing to execute along our plans and our plans include winding down Holdings in an economically rational fashion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Great. Okay. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Today might not be the best day to talk about bringing down excess liquidity just given some of the macro issues out there but you did mention it earlier again today. I appreciate we don't even know what the liquidity rules are out there for you or for other banks. But as you think about what you need, in your opinion, maybe you could size what the excess liquidity is and what some of the opportunities might be, going forward in terms of deployment?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Well, we have, virtually 25% of our balance sheet is in some form of liquid asset whether that be cash in the bank or highly liquid AFS securities. That's clearly higher than I would expect we need to be on a long-term basis. We'll have to see again how some of these rules clarify before I could tell you whether that's 5% too high, 10% too high, but it's obviously higher than we would expect it to be right now. That's a lot of cash that we can put to work. And as we continue to grow the loan book in Citicorp, hopefully, that's one good outlet. Obviously, as we continue to wind down Citi Holdings, Citi Holdings keeps on filling up our cash coffers. And so it's somewhat of a push and shove as far as trying to, we want to get rid of Citi Holdings, but it's generating excess liquidity that we've got to find a place to put to work. The other thing that you should start to see especially in the second half of this year, as we've said publicly, we're going to let a lot of our maturing debt just runoff and so in the second half of the year, there's probably $15 billion or so of -- I mean, it's $12 billion of TLGP debt that we'll just allow to run off. And so that will also be a way of siphoning off some of the excess cash.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. For all the NIM questions that we got, that's obviously slightly positive for the NIM as that rolls off, I would assume?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yes, it is.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And then just separately, on the investments spend that you're doing in the core franchise, as we think beyond this year, is it still at an elevated pace? Is it more of a normal pace? How should we think about how much you're doing now versus how much needs to be done going forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Well, I'm not going to give you a specific answer, which is probably no surprise. But it's going to be somewhat dependent on how successful we are being able to demonstrate the fact that we can actually tie the increased investment spending to revenue growth. North America, I think, you will see some North American consumer. We will have heightened investment spending there compared to what we're doing. That's -- you can certainly hear that in some of the public comments that have come out. So it will be at, certainly, at the levels that we can justify based upon the results that our investment spending that we made to date can justify.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. All right. Thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question comes from the line of Richard Bove with Rochdale Securities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Richard Bove - Rochdale Securities LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I'm a little bit confused as to where future earnings are going to come from. 62% of your revenues is coming from net interest income and it looks to me like that's going to continue to decline because you're indicating that earning assets at net interest margins are going down. On the expense side, it would appear, if you're going to have $48 billion to $50 billion, that you're looking at flat to up expenses. So 62% of your revenues come down, your expenses go up slightly. That squeezes you into getting future earnings out of noninterest income, which really brings you down at trading and probably reducing the reserve further. So is that where the future earnings are going to come from, trading and reducing, if you will, loan losses or is there some other area of the bank which is going to be able to generate higher interest income?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yes, somewhere along the line, Dick, I think I confused you and I apologize for that. When you take a look at the future earnings, what you're going to see over the course, certainly, of the next year, year and a half, we're going to continue to wind down Citi Holdings. And unfortunately, Citi Holdings will be a drain on our income for a while, specifically on the revenue line. As we continue to wind down those assets, you're going to see reduced income from Citi Holdings assets. Now at the same point in time, we are actively growing the earnings assets in Citicorp. Again, loan growth in Citicorp, 10% year-over-year. Loan growth in our consumer business, in Latin America, 17% year-over-year. Loan growth in Asia, 16% year-over-year. So all of those are earning assets that you should start to see replacing the revenue, the interest revenue that's being lost by Citi Holdings. It's a matter of pacing as far as the rate of decline in one and the rate of growth in the other. But we would actually think that over time, the mix of our business is going to be more towards the model that Vikram laid out 2-plus years ago, which is roughly 1/3 from Securities and Banking, what you would, I guess, call trading; 1/3 from a consumer business; and then 1/3 out of services, we call services Transaction Services, Private Bank, et cetera. So that is the Citicorp that we are trying to grow. And I'm sorry if I confused you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Richard Bove - Rochdale Securities LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">No, I understand. But right now, almost 2/3 of the revenue are coming from one source and that's net interest income and from what I've heard, I don't see how net interest margins are going to go up any time soon. And if you will, reduction in the size of Citi Holdings, is equal to or greater than the increase in the loans from emerging markets, your earning assets are going to continue to decline. So you got a 16% year-over-year decline in net interest income. And at some point, that number is simply going to go up or your earnings are not going to go up.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Let's talk about two separate concepts. Net interest revenue, gross dollars and then net interest margin percentage. Net interest margin, as I said before, I think, will stay under pressure for at least the next quarter due to some factors. Whether that's the continued spread compression that we're seeing and also, then I've got the FDIC additional assessments. But then, in answer to somebody else, net interest margins should look to stabilize. That's the percentage. Net interest revenue, and again, I don't want to start forecasting net interest revenue. But net interest revenue as we grow those loan volumes in Citicorp, at that growth, the absolute growth begins then to overtake the declines in the Citi Holdings assets. Then you should start to see some growth even on the net interest line.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Richard Bove - Rochdale Securities LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Just some clarification on the OCI, it went up a lot this quarter and that helped tangible book value. What's the key driver there and should we expect similar volatility in OCI in the future?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yes, Mike, two big drivers on OCI. One is the asset transfer that I mentioned earlier. That was $1.1 billion favorable impact to OCI. And then the other significant impact on OCI would be cumulative translation adjustments, FAS 52 adjustments. And that benefited us about $0.04 in tangible book value.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And then a separate question, why are you guys doing the reverse stock split? We all have our reasons why you might be doing it, but I'm not sure we heard directly from you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Vikram Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I think, Mike, we're pretty clear in our public press releases and other communications. We've got a couple of reasons and one of them is that -- and you've got to talk about not only the stock split, but also our intention in the second quarter to reinstate a, albeit a nominal, dividend . And there are some clientele reasons, one, there are a number of clients who can't buy stocks at either $5 or $10 per share or below those. And then there are some who can't buy a stock without some dividend, those are some of the obvious ones. In addition to that, we do think that it could have an impact using volatility of the stock as the stock prices at a different level. I would also tell you that post the reverse split, both the number of shares outstanding and the stock price are closer to our peers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And then lastly, S&amp;P put on negative watch, U.S. Government debt. How do you think about the potential implications of that change and that would go to maybe the securities you have in your balance sheet or some other activities. How do you think about protecting yourself?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Vikram Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Well, we're glad we're in 100-plus countries to start with because there is a level of diversification that goes with that. And in line with what our clients need because what that says is, that we really look at our entire balance sheet, that's the first point. The second point is that I haven't really looked at what S&amp;P said this morning, so I don't really have any deeper insight against what we said. But I'd also tell you, I have full confidence in our administrative and our legislative policies to get our country to the right place.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">All right. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question comes from the line of Carole Berger with Soleil Securities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Carole Berger - Soleil Securities Group, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Bank of America took a charge on their MSRs [Mortgage Servicing Rights] this quarter, citing of the settlement with the regulators and the higher costs going forward for servicing. I know you didn't discuss it, but how do you view higher servicing costs, was there an embedded charge that was material or immaterial in the quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Yes, Carole, we've taken a look at the consent order, and frankly, we identified improvements that needed to be made in our mortgage servicing operation back in 2009. And so we're actively working on improving servicing dating back to the fourth quarter of that year. As a matter of fact, we had most of the improvements in place by February 2010. Now the consent order does contain some additional things that we'll have to address. But as we've looked at the impact of the consent order, we've estimated that it'll have about a $25 million to $30 million annual increase in expenses for us. So really not that much and we don't expect it to have much of an impact on our MSR asset.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Carole Berger - Soleil Securities Group, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And what are you carrying your MSRs at now?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">The cap rate, I think, is 1.15%, so we've got a mortgage servicing book of about $440 billion, so it's like $4.7 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Carole Berger - Soleil Securities Group, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And you have no further questions at this time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John Andrews</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Great. Thank you, everyone, for joining us again. We appreciate the time you took this morning. The call will be available on replay later this afternoon on the website.

If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Mr. Andrews, you may begin.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>John Andrews</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Sara, thank you very much, and good morning to everybody. Thank you for joining us this morning. On the call today, we'll start off with Vikram, our CEO, who will give you an overview of the quarter. And then John Gerspach, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation, which is available for download on our website, www.citigroup.com. Afterwards, we will be happy to take your questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements which are based on management's current expectation and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results and capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings and including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2010 Form 10-K.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">With that out of the way, now let me turn it over to Vikram.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Vikram Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">John, thank you. And good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us today. We announced earnings of $3.3 billion for the second quarter, which brings our total net income for the first half to $6.3 billion. This was another solid quarter of operating performance as we continue to execute our strategy and invest in our franchise. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Loans grew throughout our core businesses in the second quarter at a level that more than offset the reduction in Citi Holdings. The revenues from our International Consumer Banking operations increased from the previous quarter and year, as did the net income from the North American Consumer Bank. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">In our Institutional Businesses, Investment, Corporate and Private Banking revenues improved. Global Transaction Services performed very well, as net income increased from the previous quarter, despite continued low interest rates. However, our Markets business was clearly impacted by the trading environment. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">In Citi Holdings, we continued the reduction of assets in an economically rational manner. Our Holdings assets were reduced by $29 billion during the quarter, from $337 billion to $308 billion, and now make up less than 16% of Citigroup's balance sheet. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We remain on track to meet the Basel III capital requirements through both the optimization of our assets and the generation of capital. We continue to expect that Citi will be in a position to return capital to shareholders in 2012 and still have an 8% to 9% Basel III Tier 1 common capital ratio at the end of that year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">As we'll show later in the presentation, and John Gerspach will take you through this, our earnings and utilization of deferred tax assets create a multiplier effect on regulatory capital formation. In the first half of this year, this generated $9 billion of Basel III regulatory capital on $6.3 billion of earnings and $1.5 billion of DTA utilization. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Looking forward, while we are comfortable with the broader macro economic trends that underpin our strategy, we are concerned with the impact the near-term economic environment will have on the industry for the second half of the year. But that said, we are consistently profitable and remain focused on growing responsibly. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Let me turn it over to John, who will take you through our presentation, then we'll come back to the Q&amp;A later.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Thank you, Vikram, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 2, Citigroup reported second quarter net income of $3.3 billion or $1.09 per diluted share versus $0.90 per share in the second quarter of 2010. Revenues of $20.6 billion were down 7% versus the prior year, as strong growth in International Consumer Banking and Transaction Services was more than offset by lower revenues in Citi Holdings, Securities and Banking and North America Consumer Banking. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Expenses were up 9% year-over-year to $12.9 billion. But excluding the U.K. bonus tax of roughly $400 million in the second quarter of 2010, expenses were up nearly 13%. Approximately 1/3 of this 13% increase resulted from the impact of foreign exchange, and another 1/3 was related to higher legal and related costs. The remaining 1/3 was driven by the net impact of investment spending, partially offset by ongoing productivity savings. All other expense increases, such as higher volume-related costs in Citicorp, were largely offset by a reduction in Citi Holdings expenses. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Net credit losses declined again in the second quarter to $5.1 billion, 35% lower than the second quarter of 2010. We also released $2 billion of net loan loss reserves compared to a $1.5 billion net release last year and a $3.3 billion in the first quarter. On a sequential basis, end-of-period loans grew 2% for Citigroup, as strong loan growth in Citicorp more than offset the decline in Citi Holdings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Turning now to Citicorp and Citi Holdings on Slide 3. Citicorp reported revenues of $16.3 billion and net income of $3.7 billion in the second quarter is down slightly versus last year. Sequentially, we grew end-of-period loans in every business in every region in Citicorp, and the same holds true year-over-year with the exception of North America branded cards. Versus last year, Citicorp loans grew 16%, including 11% growth in consumer and 22% growth in corporate loans. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Citi Holdings reported revenues of $4 billion and a net loss of $218 million, which included over $0.5 billion of pretax realized gains on the sale of assets transferred out of held-to-maturity in the Special Asset Pool in the first quarter. Citi Holdings ended the quarter with $308 billion of assets, down $29 billion during the quarter and $157 billion year-over-year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Now on Slide 4, we show a 9-quarter trend for Citicorp's results. Excluding CVA, Citicorp's revenues of $16.2 billion in the second quarter were flat versus the prior year. Sequentially, revenues were down 3% as growth in Regional Consumer Banking and Transaction Services was more than offset by lower revenues in Securities and Banking. Operating expenses of $10.1 billion were up 10% versus the prior year, but again excluding the U.K. bonus tax in the second quarter of 2010, expenses were up 14%. Over 1/4 of this 14% increase resulted from the impact of foreign exchange. The remainder was primarily driven by investment spending. All other expense increases, such as higher volume-related costs, were largely offset by ongoing productivity savings. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Citicorp's net credit losses were $2.2 billion, down 27% from the prior year, driven by Citi-branded cards in North America. We released $914 million in net loan loss reserves, up from $665 million last year, due to higher net releases in Citi-branded cards, partially offset by lower releases in International Consumer Banking and the corporate portfolio. Excluding CVA, earnings before taxes of $4.9 billion were up 3% year-over-year as lower credit costs more than offset higher operating expenses. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Emerging markets continue to be a significant driver of Citicorp results, as shown on Slide 5. Excluding CVA, emerging markets contributed nearly half of Citicorp's revenues and over 60% of earnings before taxes in the second quarter. Emerging markets revenues have grown year-over-year for 5 consecutive quarters, driven by both our consumer and institutional businesses. This growth reflects consistent strength in underlying business drivers, with average deposits up 13% year-over-year and loans up 27%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Slide 6 shows results for our North America Consumer Banking business. Revenues of $3.4 billion were down 9% versus last year, mainly due to a decline in average card loans, lower mortgage revenues and the impact of CARD Act. Sequentially, revenues were up 1%. Expenses of $1.8 billion were up 17% year-over-year and 5% sequentially as we continued to increase investments largely through higher marketing and technology spending. Credit costs declined 74% from last year to $552 million. Net credit losses were down 39% to $1.3 billion, driven by Citi-branded cards. And the reserve release was $757 million this quarter. Net credit margin grew by 32% year-over-year to $2.1 billion. Sequentially, we grew both end-of-period retail and card loans, although average card loans declined modestly. On a year-over-year basis, purchase sales grew 2% while card accounts were roughly flat.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to our International Consumer Banking businesses on Slide 7. International revenues were $4.8 billion in the second quarter, up 12% year-over-year with growth in all regions. Revenue growth reflects continued improvement in underlying drivers as well as the benefit from foreign exchange, partially offset by spread compression. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Year-over-year, average deposits and loans grew by 17% and 20% respectively. Investment sales were up 5% versus last year and card purchases grew 28%. Expenses were $3 billion in the second quarter, up 19% versus last year, with over 1/3 of the increase due to the impact of foreign exchange. The remainder primarily reflects higher investment spending and volume-related costs partially offset by continued productivity savings. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">A lower net reserve release resulted in an increase in credit costs, up 52% year-over-year to $629 million. Net credit losses declined 12% to $697 million, while the net loan loss reserve release was $90 million this quarter versus $403 million in the prior year. Higher revenues and lower net credit losses resulted in net credit margin expansion, up 17% year-over-year to $4.1 billion. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On Slide 8, we show growth trends for International Consumer Banking in more detail. International growth reflects both the economic environment in these markets as well as the results of our investment spending. Sequentially, we have grown average loans and deposits every quarter for over 2 years, and card purchase sales have increased year-over-year for 7 quarters. We have also increased our net credit margin and our earnings before taxes, excluding the impact of loan loss reserves, year-over-year for 7 consecutive quarters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Slide 9 shows our Securities and Banking business. Excluding CVA, revenues of $5.3 billion were down 7% from last year and down 15% versus the prior quarter. In investment banking, revenues of $1.1 billion were up 27% sequentially with strength in both advisory and underwriting activities. x CVA, equity market revenues of $776 million were down 30% sequentially, mainly due to lower market volumes and a challenging trading environment, particularly in derivatives. Fixed income market revenues x CVA were down 27% sequentially to $2.9 billion, driven by credit-related and securitized products. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Our rates and currencies business showed a much smaller revenue decline as lower G10 revenues were partially offset by growth in emerging markets. Lending revenues were $346 million, up from $244 million last quarter due to lower hedge losses. Private Bank revenues excluding CVA were up 7% sequentially to $555 million. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Total operating expenses of $3.9 billion were down 1% from the second quarter of 2010. Excluding the impact of the U.K. bonus tax last year, expenses were up 9%, mainly due to investment spending, partially offset by productivity savings. Credit costs were $59 million in the second quarter compared to a benefit in the prior year period. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Now moving to Transaction Services on Slide 10. Revenues of $2.7 billion were up 6% from the second quarter of last year, driven by growth in the emerging markets. Treasury and trade solutions was up 6%, primarily due to higher trade revenues and increased deposits, partially offset by spread compression. Securities and fund services grew 6% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in custody and securities lending on new credit -- on new client mandates as well as market activity. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Transaction volumes and new mandates continue to show momentum in both businesses. Asset growth was driven by trade loans, with average trade assets up 70% from last year. Average deposits grew 14% year-over-year to $365 billion with a favorable shift towards core operating balances. Assets under custody were up 19% to $13.5 trillion as a result of market and client activity. Expenses of $1.4 billion were up 18% versus last year, reflecting higher volumes and continued investments, partially offset by productivity savings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On Slide 11, we show a 9-quarter trend for Citi Holdings. The loss in Citi Holdings narrowed to $218 million in the second quarter, which included over $0.5 billion of realized pretax gains on the sale of assets transferred out of held-to-maturity in the Special Asset Pool in the first quarter. Revenues were down 18% year-over-year to $4 billion due primarily to lower assets. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">While expenses of $2.2 billion were down 9% versus last year, sequentially, costs were up $185 million primarily due to higher legal and related costs. Total credit costs were down by more than half to $2.1 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Looking at Citi Holdings in more detail on Slide 12. Revenues in Brokerage and Asset Management were $47 million this quarter, down from the second quarter of 2010, reflecting a lower contribution from the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney JV. In Local Consumer Lending, revenues were down 30% versus last year to $2.9 billion, driven by declining loan balances. In the Special Asset Pool, revenues were $1 billion in the second quarter, reflecting the previously mentioned realized gains on the sale of assets transferred out of held-to-maturity last quarter, as well as realized gains on other asset dispositions. Credit costs were down by more than half year-over-year to $2.1 billion as credit trends continued to improve in both the consumer and corporate portfolios. Total net credit losses were down 40% to $3 billion, and we released $1.1 billion of net loan loss reserves in Citi Holdings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Slide 13 shows the Citi Holdings assets. We ended the quarter with $308 billion in Citi Holdings or 16% of total Citigroup assets. The $29 billion reduction in the second quarter was comprised of nearly $21 billion of asset sales and business dispositions, over $7 billion of net runoff and paydowns and roughly $1 billion of net cost of credit and net asset marks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On Slide 4, we show -- on Slide 14, pardon me, we show the drivers of Citi Holdings' wind-down over the past 10 quarters. Net credit cost and net asset marks are down dramatically since early 2009, representing only $2 billion of net decline in the first half of 2011. The next largest component is net runoff and paydowns, which have gradually declined as the remaining portfolio has gotten smaller. Finally, the most significant driver has been asset sales and business dispositions. As we have discussed previously, there is a smaller pool of assets available for sale today than in prior periods. Additionally, there are only a few remaining businesses of significant size, and future sales activity would depend on both attractive terms and a favorable funding environment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Moving to Slide 15, we take a closer look at the remaining assets in Citi Holdings. Brokerage and Asset Management is mostly related to the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney JV. Morgan Stanley has calls to purchase our stake in the JV in 3 tranches beginning in 2012, and either party has the right to cause an IPO after 2015. We have also roughly $12 billion of margin loans and other assets, the majority of which should transfer to the JV by the end of 2012. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Local Consumer Lending is a mix of operating businesses and runoff portfolios. Two sizable operating businesses remain. First is retail partner cards with $45 billion of assets. Second is Citi Financial with $32 billion of assets, including both the one main business and Citi Financial servicing. On Slide 15, these assets are included in both mortgages and personal loans. The majority of assets in Local Consumer Lending will either run off or be reduced by smaller sales. Over half of the assets are mortgages with a roughly 6-year expected average life. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">The Special Asset Pool consists of securities, loans and other assets. Roughly $19 billion are trading assets or available-for-sale. $13 billion are held-to-maturity securities with an expected average life of 7 years. $7 billion are loans and leases which we currently expect to reduce significantly by the end of next year. And the remainder is other assets, including private equity positions, targeted for sale.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Slide 16 shows the results of the Corporate/Other segment. Here, revenues declined by $400 million versus last year, reflecting lower investment yields and the impact of hedging activities, partially offset by the gain on sale of a portion of our stake in HDFC this quarter. Net income also reflects higher operating expenses during the quarter. Expenses were up by $415 million versus last year, mainly due to legal and related costs. Assets of $269 billion include approximately $78 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $130 billion of liquid available-for-sale securities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Slide 17 shows total Citigroup net credit losses and loan loss reserves. NCLs continued to improve in the second quarter, down 18% sequentially to $5.1 billion. And the net LLR release was $2 billion versus $3.3 billion in the prior quarter. We ended the quarter with $34.4 billion of total loan loss reserves and our LLR ratio was 5.4%. Consumer NCLs declined 11% sequentially to $4.8 billion, and we released $1.5 billion in net loan loss reserves. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Corporate credit was a benefit of $107 million in the second quarter compared to $520 million last quarter. Corporate net credit losses were down 59% sequentially to $349 million, driven in part by lower cost of loan sales. We released $456 million of net corporate loan loss reserves, down from $1.4 billion in the first quarter. Corporate nonaccrual loans of $4.8 billion were down 12% versus the prior quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Slide 18 shows our international consumer credit trends. In Citicorp, as our loan portfolios grew, dollar NCLs were up modestly from the first quarter in Asia and Latin America, but remain stable to improving on a rate basis. 90-plus-day delinquencies also increased sequentially in dollar terms in Asia and Latin America, but remain fairly stable as a percentage of loans. We also saw a continued improvement in international consumer credit in Citi Holdings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On Slide 19, we show North America Citi-branded cards in Citicorp and retail partner cards in Citi Holdings. Credit trends for both portfolios continue to improve. In Citi-branded card, NCLs decreased by 9% sequentially to $1.2 billion, and 90-plus-day delinquencies were down 16% to $1.2 billion. In retail partner cards, NCLs decreased by 14% sequentially to $956 million, and 90-plus-day delinquencies declined by 18% to $1.1 billion. For both portfolios, early stage delinquencies also showed improvement on both a dollar and a rate basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On Slide 20, we show the North America mortgage portfolio in Citi Holdings, split between residential first mortgages and home equity loans. NCLs and 90-plus-day delinquencies improved in both portfolios in the second quarter. In residential first mortgages, we ended the second quarter with $73 billion of loans, down 19% from a year ago. Sequentially, 90-plus-day delinquencies declined by 13% to $3.9 billion and were down more than 50% from last year. Net credit losses were down 17% sequentially to $461 million. The sequential decline in first mortgage delinquencies again was primarily due to continued asset sales, as we sold nearly $800 million in delinquent mortgages in the quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Regarding modification activity. Over the past 9 quarters, we have converted $5.7 billion of trial mods to permanent modifications. More than 3/4 of these modifications were HAMP, and we continue to experience re-default rates on HAMP-modified loans of less than 15%. The remainder were modified under other Citi programs, and to date, the re-default rate on these modifications has been less than 25%. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">In recent quarters, the pace of our modification activity has slowed. Going forward, we expect fewer new modifications, while some portion of our previous modifications will re-default. As a result, delinquency trends may deteriorate. However, this is already factored into our net loan loss reserve balances. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">In the second quarter, we recorded a modest increase in our net loan loss reserves primarily related to home equity loans. We ended the quarter with roughly $10 billion of our total loan loss reserves allocated to North America real estate lending in Citi Holdings, or over 27 months of coincident NCL coverage. Now for our total North America consumer mortgage portfolio, including Citi Holdings as well as $27 billion of residential first mortgage and home equity loans in Citicorp, our reserves also cover over 27 months of NCLs. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Slide 21 shows the trend in our key capital metrics. We ended the quarter with a Tier 1 capital ratio of 13.6% and a Tier 1 common ratio of 11.6%. Our total risk-weighted assets were $992 million -- $992 billion, with roughly 28% attributable to Citi Holdings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Looking at risk-weighted assets in more detail on Slide 22. Over the past few quarters, Citigroup's risk-weighted assets, as reported under Basel I, have been fairly constant, as growth in Citicorp has been offset by a significant reduction in Citi Holdings. We currently expect risk-weighted assets under Basel I to grow slightly by low single digits as of the end of 2012. Based on our initial analysis, last year we estimated that Basel III would result in an increase in risk-weighted assets in Citicorp of approximately 30% to 35%. Today, we believe the increase in risk-weighted assets for total Citigroup will be in the range of 35%, with Citicorp's risk-weighted assets increasing in the range of 20%. The refinement in our estimate of the risk-weighted asset impact is based on several factors, including greater experience with Basel III risk models and key drivers and more clarity on the impact of mitigating actions. We believe our businesses in Citicorp are inherently Basel III-friendly. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">For Regional Consumer Banking and Transaction Services, we expect only a slight increase in risk-weighted assets under Basel III. In Regional Consumer Banking, we serve a customer base with generally higher credit quality, which positively affects our risk weightings. Transaction Services is an asset-light business with relatively little credit risk. As expected, the greatest impact of Basel III will be on our risk-weighted assets in Securities and Banking. Of course, we will continue to refine our estimates of risk-weighted assets under Basel III as additional clarity and guidance becomes available. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Turning to capital generation on Slide 23. In the first half of 2011, Citigroup earned a total of $6.3 billion in net income. We also utilized $1.5 billion of DTA. Under Basel III, we deduct a significant portion of our DTA from our equity when calculating Tier 1 common capital. Therefore, utilizing DTA generates regulatory capital by reducing the size of the DTA and hence, its deduction from equity. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">In addition, both earnings and the DTA usage also create a \"multiplier effect\" on the growth of regulatory capital. Under Basel III, the inclusion of DTA, mortgage servicing rights and unconsolidated investments and financial subsidiaries is subject to limitation based on a percentage of Tier 1 common capital. Therefore, any growth in Tier 1 common capital results in a larger portion of these assets being included in Basel III regulatory capital. The combined impact of earnings, DTA usage and the \"multiplier effect\" generated $9 billion of Basel III Tier 1 common capital in the first half of 2011. Additionally over time, we expect to continue to generate capital from the wind-down of Citi Holdings as well as other mitigating actions. We expect to end 2012 with an 8% to 9% Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III as fully implemented, including the impact of returning capital to shareholders during the year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Now in summary, we continue to execute our strategy in the second quarter. Now I'd like to discuss some factors which may affect our results in the second half of 2011. In North America Consumer Banking, we expect revenues to continue to stabilize in the second half of the year, while net credit losses should continue to improve. We will also continue to invest in the business. In International Consumer Banking, our investment spending should continue to generate revenue growth. We currently expect both Asia and Latin America consumer banking to achieve positive operating leverage in the fourth quarter of this year. International credit costs are likely to continue to increase in the second half of the year, reflecting a growing loan portfolio. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">In our Institutional businesses, Securities and Banking results will continue to reflect trends and client activity, global market conditions and seasonal factors. Transaction Services should continue to benefit from increased volumes and the globalization of trade and capital flows, partially offset by continued spread compression. Corporate credit costs are expected to increase, reflecting growth in corporate loans. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">In Local Consumer Lending in Citi Holdings, revenues should continue to decline, given a shrinking loan balance resulting from paydowns and continued asset sales. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Regarding operating expenses. The impact of the weakening U.S. dollar, as well as higher legal and related costs, total roughly $1.6 billion out of the $1.9 billion increase in our expense base in the first half of 2011 as compared to the first half of last year. These factors will likely continue to affect our expenses in the second half of this year and will remain difficult to predict. Therefore, we expect operating expenses to remain elevated for the remainder of the year. As a result, our full year operating expenses will likely exceed the $48 billion to $50 billion guidance that we had communicated previously. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">That concludes our review of the quarter. And Vikram and I will now open up the line for questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p7\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Nomura.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">First question is combining the Slides 14 and 22, and I just want to make sure I'm reading it correct. If you look and see the recent run rate of, call it, $40 billion to $50 billion of organic paydown and runoff in Holdings and combine that with the 1.75 multiplier, I just want to make sure, that looks like you can get anywhere from $70 billion to $100 billion of risk-weighted asset in actual runoff on an annual basis. Am I reading that correct?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I haven't done that math, Glenn, I'd have to admit. But if you take a look at the way the assets are declining, again, the way we look at the asset decline, we would expect the Basel III multiplier effect on those remaining holding assets to be about 1.75x at the end of next year. And how you get to that 1.75, or how you think of terms of where we end up in assets is also going to depend on where you think we end up in total asset mix of Citi Holdings' assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Right. And I guess I can't get a comment on progress on Citi Financial and private label cards, because that's kind of in motion. Is that fair?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">That's fair. Fair that you can't get a comment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Another clarification -- I understand. Slide 26, on your exposure to the GIPSI, formally known as the PIIGS. I just want to make sure I'm reading this correct also. Of the $13 billion in net exposure, only $1 billion is to sovereigns and -- or a little more than $1 billion. And that next comment is what I want clarification on. Is 70% of the $6 billion to financial institutions is subs that are to non-GIPSI subs to outside the GIPSI region, right, so...</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Let me give you an example of something that might be contemplated by that comment, all right? Say that we had a deposit in a branch, a separately capitalized sub of one of the GIIPS banks, offshore out of the GIIPS zone, but that deposit was guaranteed by the parent company in one of the GIIPS countries. We would count that in the $6 billion as being part of the exposure merely because it's covered by a parent company guarantee.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Got it, okay. And then the net takeaway of Slide 26 is that you feel like you're in pretty good shape and you've been preparing for this. And netting your exposure, even your unfunded exposures, the large multinationals. That's the net takeaway we're supposed to take away, correct?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Well, you can draw your own conclusion. But obviously, we've been telling you that we thought the exposure was manageable, now we provided you more detail. And it's obviously been something that we've been working for a long time. And above that, Glenn, we think that this exposure as it is today, it's appropriately -- it's an appropriate number given our size, our stature and our business model.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Vikram Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">But let me add one thing to that. I think what Glenn's talking about is in some ways getting a handle on, is this appropriate business? So what is appropriate business? And that's exactly the reason, Glenn, that we have provided you with the appropriate amount of transparency to sort of get beyond the headline numbers. And so for example, you talked about the sovereign exposure, a little bit more than $1 billion. Well, that number has come down a lot over time. And we've gone through that process the last few quarters. On the other hand, you asked about the financials. That's an interesting one because -- let me tell you what we did last quarter. We worked with some of the financial institutions in the region to create lending that is collateralized and secured and in other subsidiaries in other parts of the world. Now that is the right thing and the right kind of business. It's right for our client. It's right for our investors, right for our shareholders. And there are going to be other great opportunities that is considered by us to be appropriate business, but that will get picked up in some of these numbers, which is why differentiation and transparency is important as well here. And we've also given you, as you know, a breakdown between funded and unfunded lines. You know very well the conditions that are required to be met by borrowers before they draw unfunded lines. And as you can see, a lot of that exposure is to multinational clients as well. So differentiation is important. I think the question you've asked is important, and that's why we're given you this kind of transparency. And I really think that's the kind of transparency you should expect.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. And just a quick one to wrap up. Vikram, you've mentioned you're concerned about the economic impact on the industry for the second half. Maybe just a little clarification to spoonfeed, how could that manifest itself to the industry? It just means slower growth for everybody, is that your point?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Vikram Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Well, I think, well, it's uncertain growth is what this notion is. And I don't -- I mean, you watch what's going on around the world as well as anybody else on this call. There is just a lot of uncertainty out there. And it may not be uncertainty that leads to any kind of crisis, but here's the kind of uncertainty that can affect people's confidence and can affect trading volumes in the market. It can affect how spreads go on. And we think it's that kind of uncertainty, while we all hope gets resolved soon, is likely to last through the rest of the year. And that doesn't necessarily affect all the underlying trends in terms the emerging market consumer, and all of the underlying themes are still intact. But near term, we just think there's a lot of uncertainty that could undermine confidence and affect volumes and affect the kind of growth one could see. Now that could turn too, if somebody -- if you had more certainty in certain aspects of the world, you could see the risk [indiscernible] as well. So that's really the point.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question comes from the line of Jason Goldberg with Barclays Capital.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Jason Goldberg - Barclays Capital</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Just I guess a follow-up. I thought the disclosure of 14 and 15 on the Citi Holdings runoff was helpful, and I guess you commented that it slowed. It looks like it's kind of now down to like the high single-digit type billion-dollar per quarter runoff pace. Is that kind of what we should expect going forward just from kind of paydowns and losses?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Well, I think as the portfolio continues to shrink, the paydowns will reduce as well as a percentage. So again, we tried to give you enough on Page 14 and Page 15 that you can kind of conduct your own analysis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Jason Goldberg - Barclays Capital</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. And then you kind of gave us the denominator, but I guess on the numerator on Basel III, I guess-- where would you kind of peg kind of Tier 1 common today on dollar basis versus kind of where you would see it under Basel III? And maybe just some similar color there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And what we said there, Jason, is that -- as we've been saying, we intend to operate at an 8% to 9% Tier 1 common range under Basel III by the end of next year. But that's our target. That's been our target for the last 9 months. And we've been consistent with that because we think that, that's the right level of capital for us to have. And that's what we're working towards for next year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Jason Goldberg - Barclays Capital</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Got it. And then just lastly, you commented about the operating expenses being above your prior guidance. Would you care to put kind of a new bracketed range on that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I'll tell you, Jason, given the continued weakening of the dollar and the uncertainty surrounding the industry regarding litigation matters, I would say that what you should do is take a look at where we are today and figure that we're going to be around those levels going forward, subject again to whatever might happen with the dollar and those litigation matters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>James Mitchell - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Quick question on the Basel III target. You mentioned that's inclusive of buybacks or dividends or both. Can you kind of give any kind of indication of what that magnitude that is contemplated in that target, or is it mostly buyback...</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We're not going to get ahead of ourselves here. We're looking to, as we said, to return -- we expect to be able to return capital to shareholders next year, but we're not going to start to comment yet as to what the size or the timing of that may be.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>James Mitchell - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Fair enough. But do you think -- is it mostly buyback oriented or dividend oriented, do you think?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Same comment. I think we're a little early in trying to structure how that divide might work. Obviously, given where our stock is trading, when you have stock trading below book value, below tangible book value, that would certainly color your thinking.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>James Mitchell - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes. Fair enough. And then maybe on the assets and holdings, it was helpful in terms of the table and how to think about the wind-down. Can you maybe give some help on how to think about the risk-weighted asset? What is heavier, I guess, in Citi Holdings in terms of the risk-weighted assets under Basel III versus what are lighter? So is it mortgages that are the biggest hit, or is it the Special Asset Pool? And we can kind of do our own conclusions on the pace of runoff on the individual assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Well, Basel III certainly puts a premium on any type of asset that's resulting from a securitization. And so that would sort of draw your attention to more of assets that are in Special Asset Pool.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>James Mitchell - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Right. So to the extent that you can move those down more quickly, that could be helpful?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">That would be the logical conclusion, yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>James Mitchell - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Right, okay. And one last question on the legal expenses. Can you give us a sense of what that might have been in the quarter so we can just sort of make our own projections on how to think about what's the kind of the run rate? And then on top of that, what's the legal expenses in 2Q?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Again, I think what we're talking about is the growth in the legal expenses year-on-year. As we've said, the litigation and related matters added roughly $900 million to our expense base in the first half of this year compared to the first half of last year. And so that's about the level that we're looking at.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>James Mitchell - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">But we don't know what it was last year, so we don't know the Absolute number.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">No, and I'm not going to going to exactly what we had baked into what last year was.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Bank of America.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">On some of those expenses, I think I heard you say that basically all of the increase in Citi Holdings' quarterly expense, which was about $200 million up from last quarter, was due to those legal expenses. Is that right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">That's what we said, yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. And you think that we should run that forward at around that level for the remainder of the year. Is that right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I'm not going to say that you should run those Citi Holdings expenses, at least that level of litigation in Citi Holdings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And are you going to be trying to -- do you think you will be able to achieve any reductions in the underlying operating expense in Citi Holdings over the remainder of the year? Because it looked like there was pretty good progress in the earlier part of this year there, and then obviously, you've kind of given some of that up with these legal expenses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes, and we continue to drive down the Citi Holdings expenses as we drive down assets. And I think we do have a pretty good track record. And you should assume that as we continue to drive down the assets in Citi Holdings, we will get expense saves coming out of the business. That is clearly the way that we are operating Citi Holdings. And to your point, we had a little bit of a bump on the road this year -- this quarter due to some legal and related costs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. In Citicorp, in Securities and Banking, obviously, we don't get a lot of color on what the expenses are. But it looks like overall, your expense load went up about $100 million, even though your revenues fell sequentially by about $500 million. What's going on there? Have you added fixed costs? Were there some onetime items there that we should be thinking about?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">No. There's no significant onetime item that I can recall hitting Securities and Banking. And what we've said is we are continuing to build out the banking franchise. So there was some add there. I'd say that we're roughly 2/3 through of what we want to accomplish as far as building out the banking franchise. And that's about it as far as anything significant that would have gone into Securities and Banking.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. Fair enough. The Brokerage and Asset Management unit, obviously mostly driven by Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, was the decline that we saw there really largely revenue and volume related? Was there anything with respect to sort of an expense share between yourselves and Morgan Stanley, which I know sometimes has bumped the numbers around? Or was this really just the underlying environment?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">No. It's a little bit of the underlying environment, but don't forget that because of the way the JV works, there are certain deposits that feed the JV. And then with the increase overall in FDIC assessment, that also works its way through the JV. And so that did have an impact on it as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay, that helps. Now in Citi Holdings, the net interest revenue went negative. Is that sort of an anomaly with respect to the asset sales that took place or something? Or should we -- or in fact, with the asset sales that have taken place, should we now expect that maybe that's a permanent fixture of that business-- that negative carry?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">That's a great question. I mean obviously, as we continue to drive down yielding assets in Citi Holdings, and in this quarter as you said, we got rid of that $13 billion of securities that we had in the hold-to-maturity. That is certainly going to impact the net interest income coming out of both the Special Asset Pool as well as Citi Holdings in total.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So should we think that, that's sort of a negative carry going forward, or was that somewhat anomalous? But we should obviously take into account that with assets lowered, net interest income will be lower no matter what. I mean, what's the best way to look at it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Again, I'm not going to get into exactly how you should be taking a look at your model. But yes, interest -- net interest revenue out of Citi Holdings will be under pressure.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And you alluded to that--the asset sale, which appears to have been very beneficial in terms of gains. But what was the RWA reduction that, maybe on a current or a Basel III basis, would even be more helpful that you achieved by getting rid of those assets in the quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Well, we haven't directly commented on that. But I've seen analyst reports that have estimated that the $12.7 billion of securities could have generated as much of $100 billion of risk-weighted assets under Basel III, and we haven't challenged any of those estimates.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay, fair enough. And then I just have one more question about the foreclosure issues that are obviously in the midst of negotiations, so we don't have a settlement yet. But I seem to remember that Citi had undertaken a review of foreclosure procedures before the whole thing really started blowing up last September. And the sense I had was that your procedures were more compliant with what's needed than at some other places. Do you expect to get the benefit of that in terms of how much of the industry foreclosure settlement you might have to shoulder yourselves?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">As you said, it's unclear as to exactly where these talks are headed at this point in time. And we would expect that if it's possible, we'd like to work with the other banks to structure a settlement that is both fair and reasonable and would take into account all pertinent factors.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And do you think that it's a pertinent factor that you had undertaken that review and would appear to have had a somewhat different procedure for foreclosures?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">What do you think?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Well, I would think it would matter. But I just -- we never really got a lot of color on the degree to which it reduced robo-signing issues and the like.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And I guess as with any set of discussions, along with amount, there will be discussions as far as how those amounts get apportioned and how those amounts get structured. And so I'd say all of that is in the mix right now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">John, you talked a little bit about the FX impact on expenses. Could you give us some color on the FX impact on revenues?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes, sure, Betsy. FX impacts, foreign exchange impacts, not just expense, but also revenues and net credit losses. Last quarter, I think we said that for the firm as a whole, when you looked at the impact of FX on those 3 components, it was basically a 0 for the entire corporation. This quarter, when you take a look at the impact of revenues, expenses and net credit losses, it's roughly about $100 million positive. So the total impact of FX roughly adds about $100 million to our pretax income.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. So you should have some areas, obviously, where you're getting a little bit of positive operating leverage, I would expect, from the FX itself. Is that right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">That's fair that the FX impact would -- again, it has different impact on different parts of the businesses. But there would be some that the benefit on the revenues would certainly outweigh the benefit of the expenses, yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And I mean obviously, there's a little bit of angst around the expectation that the expenses in total are going to be above the $50 billion, $48 billion to $50 billion that you talked about at the beginning of the year. Can you talk through what you're doing to keep a tight lid on expenses in areas where you're not investing? Have you done as much as you can there? Is there any opportunities to increase expense saves in areas you're not investing in?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes. And I think we're attacking that pretty hard. I mean look, we don't like the idea that our expenses are going to be above the guidance anymore than anybody else does. When you're faced with $700 million impact in the first half due to foreign exchange and say, roughly $900 million due to the increase in legal and related expenses, you've got 2 decisions to make: You can either manage back down to the guidance by cutting your investment programs; or you can agree that you're going to press on, but as we've always said, continue to find reductions in your base. And don't forget, we've targeted, we -- our basic operating mantra is that every business should be able to find approximately 3% to 5% of productivity saves every year. And that's actually the way that we have been operating and we will continue to operate. So if you think about the first half of the year, we talked about $1.6 billion worth of impact due to foreign exchange and legal and related. During that time, the impact of investments is a little bit north of $1.5 billion. So we've made about $1.5 billion of investments, and we've had roughly 50% of those investment dollars covered by productivity saves in the business. And so we're continuing to actively manage our expense base. Again, we're very conscious of -- you guys are very focused on expenses. I got to tell you, so are we. But we're also trying to make sure that we're putting the right expense dollars into the businesses to grow operating margin. We think that, that's what you want us to do, and that's really what we're doing. Now we began investing last year. We called out the fact that we were beginning to invest in our consumer businesses in Asia and Latin America. When you start investing in your consumer businesses, you've got roughly a 12- to 18-month lead time before you really begin to see something positive in operating leverage coming out of those investments. And in both of those geographies, as we said in the call, our expectation is that, beginning in the fourth quarter of this year, you will see positive operating leverage in both the Regional Consumer Banking businesses in Asia and in Latin America. Now that's pretty much on schedule. Subsequently now, we've begun investing, just this quarter, really putting investment dollars behind the North America Consumer Bank. That is going to follow the same rough pacing as our investments in Asia and Latin America. So again, it's going to be a second half of 2012 story as far as gaining positive operating leverage out of the North America Consumer Bank. In similar fashion, we are taking -- we're making investments, continuing to make investments in Transaction Services this year. That's a business that you can starve in investments for a very short period of time, but then you need to catch up. We're making those investments now. The expectation would be, again, that sometime in 2012, I'm not going to give you an exact quarter, we should start to see, again, positive operating leverage coming out of transaction banking. And that might happen even sooner if we get a rise in interest rates. So we've got plans in place for every one of our Citicorp businesses. And I left out Securities and Banking and I didn't mean to, but obviously we've been focused on rebuilding the banking platform in Securities and Banking. And as I think I mentioned during the call, we think we're about 2/3 of the way through that build-out program. You start to see this quarter, we had some nice results coming out of the investment banking group. That's something that we hope we can build on into the future. But every business has got a targeted investment program. And I think for the purposes of this question, maybe more importantly, a very targeted reengineering program that is really focused on driving those 3% to 5% productivity saves out of each of the businesses as well as the corporate staff units.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So are we at a point where that $1.5 billion gross pre the offsets that you have. That $1.5 billion gross investment spend is stabilizing in the second half, or moving up as Asia and Lat Am are? I don't know if they're on a run rate. And you're increasing in the U.S.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yes. I would say that you should still consider the second half of this year to be -- expect it to be dominated by those 3 factors. Again, FX and legal, I don't know how to forecast. But clearly, we're going to stay in an investing mode in those businesses. But again, you should start to see the revenues outpace the investment spend in both Asia and in Latin America in the fourth quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Right. And I guess just my basic question was does the investment -- you're ramping up investment spend in the U.S. Is that offset by pulling back on the investments in Asia and Latin America because you've done what you need to do, or does that $1.5 billion go up a little bit, offset by the operating leverage that you expect to get in 4Q and on in the Latin America and Asia regions?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Well, what you're going to see -- I mean, just because of the lapping of the expense growth, you should start to see moderating levels of expense increase coming out of both Latin America and Asia.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">John, in terms of the positive refinement of the Citicorp RWA inflation, can you share any color on which areas were refined in your analysis?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">It's basically every one of them. As you work through the model, I may have mentioned this in other calls, don't forget the U.S. never moved to Basel II. So really, it's only been since everyone has gotten tremendously focused on Basel III, that we've actually really spent a lot of time, on a daily operating basis, working through what are the impacts of various calculations. And everything on Basel III is model-driven. And I've made this comment before, Basel III turns your regulatory balance sheet into one giant Level 3 asset. And so it's working with every one of the models in every one of the businesses. That just provides you some greater clarity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. In all the numbers you were giving us, the multipliers in kind of the year-end '12. Are those fully mitigated, or would you have more mitigation that can be done beyond 2012 at Corp and Holdings?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Well, I wouldn't say that mitigation would be completed. But we certainly believe that by the end of 2012, we'll certainly get through the bulk of the mitigating actions. However, as in anything else, the more you work on it, the more you learn. And so it may very well be that as we continue to work, we'll find even more mitigating actions that we can do.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. And then in terms of the numerator side of Basel III, those deductions are scheduled to phase in over many years, not starting until 2014. Have you been told by regulators that you and other banks may need to meet the Basel requirements on an accelerated basis? Or is it your sense that the banks will just need to meet the requirements according to the time line that's been set forth by the Basel committee?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I don't believe that we are going to be required to meet the Basel III requirements any earlier than whatever the U.S. rules -- again, I don't know what the U.S. rules are going to say. But assuming they somewhat track the language that has been passed by the Basel committee, I don't expect us to be held to a higher standard any earlier. But I do believe that one of the things that the regulatory bodies will look for is a credible path to get to those Basel III requirements. And I think that is what the financial institutions will need to demonstrate.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">But your 8% to 9%, just to be clear, that you're talking about being at next year, that kind of conservatively fast-forwards those deductions, right? That includes those deductions that technically don't start till 2014. Is that right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">That's correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. And then the last question on the net interest margin. At the top of the house, I think you talked a little bit about NII at holdings. Just how do you see the -- what are the kind of puts and takes for your NIM and net interest income, all in at Citicorp and Citigroup, for the next couple of quarters?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. Let's start with this quarter. So we had about a 6 basis point decline in NIM quarter-on-quarter. And there's roughly say, 5 factors that drove NIM decline first quarter to second quarter. Number one would have to be the FDIC assessment. The increase in the FDIC tax cost us about 4 basis points of NIM in the quarter. The second factor would be loans. The combination of those higher-yielding loans running off in Citi Holdings combined with the lower, somewhat lower yielding net loan growth in Citicorp, that had about a 9-basis-point impact, a negative impact, on our NIM. The third factor, we had some additional borrowing costs in some of our trading businesses to fund some client positions that was a little bit higher than the first quarter. That was 3 basis points. So those are the bad guys. And then on the good guy side, this quarter, we had -- we didn't have the reserve build in Citi Financial in Japan that we had in the first quarter. So that was 7 basis points to the good. And then as we begin to roll that--run down our long-term debt, that added about a 3-basis-point positive to our NIM. So I think I've got the math right. That should net out to roughly 6 basis points. So as you think going forward, it's going to be -- the FDIC now should be behind us. That's kind of baked in. And it's going to be that combination of what happens with the runoff in loans in holdings, the loan growth in Citi, the impact of the continued runoff in the long-term debt. And so I'd say over the next 2 quarters, absent some significant portfolio sale coming out of holdings, you should probably see NIM be plus or minus 1 or 2 basis points from where we are right now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. Is the magnitude of the roll-off of long-term debt similar going forward to what we saw this quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">It'll be a little bit less. Don't forget, this quarter, about $8 billion of the runoff was due to debt buybacks that we did in the quarter. So I think absent the debt buyback, it'd be about $16 billion of a decrease. And that's probably more indicative of what you could expect in the next couple of quarters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. And then in terms of the interest-earning assets, there was a little bit of growth. You had a little bit of loan growth net and then also some--it looks like increasing in liquidity still. Is that preparing for regulatory, or is that just the positive inflows and nothing else to do with the money?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Well, we do continue to build up cash. Now we actually drove the cash down quarter-on-quarter. That was -- primarily, we used the cash to buy back debt. So we're at somewhat of an equilibrium right now as far as loan reductions and asset runoff which generates cash, and then the use of cash as far as funding loans.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question comes from the line of Ron Mandle with GIC.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Ron Mandle - GIC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I have a couple of things. So one, I was wondering about the tax rate, down from the first quarter, if this is a good level to think about for the second half of the year, or how should we think about that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yes. And Ron, the short answer is yes, it is. Again, depending upon -- this certainly reflects where we think the business mix is. Now when I say a good level, you need to look at the level for the first half of the year. Don't forget at the end of every quarter, what we do is we reassess the mix of our earnings for the remainder of the year and then adjust the tax rate. So if you look at the tax rate for the first half of the year, it's probably somewhere in the neighborhood of, say, 25%. And that's because that reflects where we believe our tax rate will be for the entirety of 2011. So we had a slightly higher tax rate in the first quarter, and now, we've actually, by lowering the tax rate to 22% or whatever it was in the second quarter, it gets us down to a first half tax rate of 25%. And that's our view of the rest of the year. Now again, that's also going to depend upon how the mix in our earnings streams run in actual for the second half of the year. But that's where we think we are right now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Ron Mandle - GIC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. And would we see a little creep upward next year at this point?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Well, we've always said, Ron, that we actually think the long-term -- the normal tax rate for us is going to be something in the 28%, 29%, maybe as high as 30% range. But if you want to stay in the range of 29%, that's pretty much has been our thinking and continues to be our thinking as to where we end up a little bit longer term.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Ron Mandle - GIC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Right, okay. And then in regards to -- a question about the legal. One aspect was you mentioned that the holdings expenses were up $185 million mainly due to legal. But with the assets down, x legal expenses, would likely have been down. So I guess my conclusion is that you actually provided considerably more than the $185 million for incremental legal expenses for holdings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I wouldn't challenge your analysis, Ron.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Ron Mandle - GIC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And I guess where I'm going with that is -- could you discuss some of the legal issues in a little bit more detail? GSE put back, private label put back, maybe what some of the other legal issues are?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Well, we don't really -- we don't comment specifically on litigation matters. But don't forget, the put back, certainly the repurchase, that doesn't go through litigation. That's actually a charge against revenue.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Ron Mandle - GIC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Right. And how much was that in the quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">We provided an additional $224 million to the reserve in the quarter. And I believe that's laid out actually on a schedule in the appendix of the investor deck.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Two separate follow-ups to topics that have come up. On the FX revenue impact, it's helpful to broadly speak of numbers of maybe $500 million or $600 million. From a geographic point of view, does it show up in net interest income and fees, a combination?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I'm sorry?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>James Mitchell - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">The FX revenue boost. Does that show up evenly in net interest income and fees? Or one more than the other.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I can't answer that, I'm sorry. It certainly impacts every one of our revenue lines. It depends upon obviously, the denomination of the currency that the different revenues are booked in. And I'm sorry, I just don't have that breakout in front of me between interest and noninterest.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. And then separately just a follow-up on, I think, John's question about the margin and the net interest income dollars going forward. If the NIM's relatively stable from here, obviously the positive loan growth that you saw this quarter is very good and it sounds like it's sustainable. So should we expect net interest income dollars to continue to rise off the second quarter level?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Again, certainly from a Citicorp perspective, that is what we would expect. The Citi Holdings is going to be dependent upon what assets run off and the timing of those runoffs as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay. But I guess as we think about loan growth overall, absent large asset sales out of Citi Holdings, it seems like you should be able to generate net loan growth for the overall company from here.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Yes. If you look at -- on a sequential basis, we had positive loan growth for the firm as a whole, second quarter compared to first quarter. Year-on-year, Citicorp loans grew 16%, Citi Holdings declined 35%. I think that you should expect that either by the end of this year or at the very early of next year, we should, on a year-on-year basis, see positive loan growth.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Your next question comes from the line of Ed Najarian with ISI Group.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Ed Najarian - ISI Group Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I guess most of my questions have been answered, but one quick one. You're seeing credit losses decline very rapidly in the partner card business, I think down more than 50% over the last 5 quarters. Any thoughts of retaining that business? And I know you've been running it as an operating business and potentially moving it over to Corp from Holdings?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Yes. As we've said before, putting the retail partner cards business in Holdings was not because we ever thought it was a bad business, it just didn't seem to fit the Citicorp strategy when we laid that out. Now we have been running the partner cards business as an operating entity. We've done a lot of work to restructure the business. But the ultimate question that we'd have to answer as far as whether or not it goes back is, \"Does it fit the Citicorp strategy?\" And that's just not a determination that we've made as of yet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Ed Najarian - ISI Group Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Are you doing any kind of analysis or thinking about trying to reevaluate that, or has your thinking remained unchanged since you made the decision to put in Holdings a while ago?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">No. We look at the businesses in Holdings from a periodic basis. You may recall at the beginning of last year, we actually moved some loans and other things out of Holdings back into Citicorp exactly because of that type of review. So we will -- we look at it all the time. And if and when we conclude any of that analysis, we'll certainly let you know.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Ed Najarian - ISI Group Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">You may or may not be willing to answer this one. Obviously, that particular business is not broken out as part of Holdings. Now with credit losses running at these lower levels, has it become significantly profitable again?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Actually, there's a slide in the appendix to the investor deck, Slide 35. If you take a look at Slide 35, retail partner cards actually generated earnings before tax of $769 million in this quarter and $697 million of pretax in the first quarter as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">The question I had was on the Citi branded cards. Your net credit losses have been steadily declining, which obviously is quite positive for the business. Do you guys have a sense of how low the net credit losses could go? It looks like they were 6.2% for the regional -- for the total Regional Consumer Bank under their Citi-branded cards. Can we see that get into the 3% to 4% range?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I think 3% to 4% may be -- never say never, but doubtful. But I think what you will see is -- I'm going to call it an overshooting, especially when you look at it on a rate basis. Don't forget on a rate basis, you've got both a numerator and a denominator effect. We are in the process of rebuilding the cards portfolio in North America. We mentioned the fact that on a sequential basis, loans increased slightly. And so that should begin to help grow the growth in the denominator. As that numerator continues to shrink, you're likely to get a very low NCL rate at some point in time. I don't know if it's going to get down with the 3 handle, but you may get a quarter where it has a 4 handle. But that's only because the loans that we'd be building--we'd be putting on the books now haven't seasoned yet. And therefore, as those loans season, I think you're likely then to rebuild back up to a more normal NCL rate, something in the 5% range.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Do you guys feel that you've turned the corner in terms of building the portfolio? Obviously, the end-of-period loans in this area grew this quarter versus the first quarter. Do you think you're now on a growth trajectory for this business?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Well, I'm cautious by nature. I'd like to see a couple of quarters of growth before I say that we've actually turned the corner. But it is good to see, at least that first quarter where you've got some small amount of sequential growth.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay. Coming back to the expenses. I know you don't want to get into the details on the legal expenses, but were any of those expenses for building up a litigation reserve for potential settlements in the future?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I would say that you can take a look at our legal and related expenses as being a combination of both expenses incurred and settlements that have already been made, and as well as in anticipation of settlements that have yet to be made.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay. Good. And then just finally, on the foreign exchange on the expense side, what's driving -- you mentioned, I think it was $700 million of elevated expenses due to foreign exchange. Can you share with us some color on what caused that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Well, it's the weakening of the dollar. Don't forget, roughly 50% of our expense base is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. So as the dollar weakens or those currencies strengthen, it causes additions to our expense base. The dollar has weakened against almost every major currency during the last year, and that's just put a real strain on the expense base. It's weakened against the euro. It's weakened against the British pound. It's weakened against the Mexico, the Mexican peso. And those are all significant contributors to our expense base.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And I guess then, the revenues in those respective areas were not as positively impacted then by the weakening dollar to offset the expenses?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">No, no, no, and I'm sorry. I thought I indicated earlier that those same moves did obviously cause revenues to grow. They also caused net credit losses to increase as well. And when you look at the net impact of foreign exchange movements on our results for the entire quarter for the entire firm, it had a net benefit of $100 million pretax. So all of those currency movements added about, again roughly, $100 million pretax income to Citigroup.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Your next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I promise I won't ask about FX, the NIM or expenses, actually. So the first thing is you mentioned the 27 months...</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Moshe, you can ask anything you want.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">All right, I think we've hit those topics. You mentioned 27 months coverage on the mortgage reserve both in holdings and in aggregate. Could you talk a bit about what you'd have to see in order to bring that down? Or do you expect the charge-offs to increase? I mean, how do we think about that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Well, I'd say the whole subject of mortgages right now is, I think everyone's waiting to see what happens coming out of these negotiations, quite frankly. We've got excellent trends building up in delinquency statistics, but there is the specter of forced write-downs and knock-on effects that, that could have. And so you want to be cautious.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I mean I understand caution, but obviously, it's -- given that the trends are improving, in other words, that should tell you that all other things being equal, you would need less reserves as opposed to more, right? I mean, isn't that correct?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">That's absolutely right. Now the one thing though, and I don't want to get preachy about this, but mortgages are really different than credit cards. Your risk on mortgages, it just hangs around for a long time because those mortgages sit in inventory once they get past the 180 days. And so you still have a great deal of severity risk that can impact you as -- until housing prices begin to rise and until you can start clearing out some of your foreclosure and process inventory, you've got an elongated period of time where you're going to have elevated credit losses. That's one of the reasons why we have been such active sellers of delinquent mortgages, because we just don't want to start building up a lot of mortgages that are sitting on our books that are more than 180 days past due.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Right. And to the extent that you have extra severity risk, I guess, as home prices decline, you're saying essentially that's partially mitigated by the fact that your delinquency trends have been better.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Delinquency trends certainly help. But once those mortgages get past that 180 days, and like I say, that's why we manage that very, very closely. That's when your severity risk really kicks in.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Right. Kind of on the comment that you made of running the capital levels at 8% to 9%, I mean I think that's very helpful kind of guidance for us. One of your competitors, JPMorgan, spoke yesterday, and they mentioned they're planning to run at 7.5%. Is the 8% to 9% kind of a basically kind of an internal classification? I mean, how should we think about how you arrived at that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Well, we arrived at that, and I think we tried to describe the thought process in the, I think it was the third quarter of last year. And we just believe that given our mix of business and where we are, we think that, that -- and recognizing interconnectiveness and everything else, we think that's the right level of capital for us to operate. I think others at that point in time were saying that they were at 7%. And they thought that 7% was it, and they weren't going to run it $1 more than 7%. We've always been targeted at this 8% to 9% level. We try to be very consistent with that. And that's the way we've have been managing the place now for going on a year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay, great. Very last quick one. In terms of the partner card business, and you've talked about that a lot. But it's not really just one kind of block of business, right? I mean, there's different partners. And is it probable or possible that some of those partners would be more consistent with your customer franchise, and maybe others less so?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">That is certainly a possibility. I certainly would not deny that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Your next question comes from the line of Peter Ganucheau with Carlson Capital.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Peter Ganucheau </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">There's been a lot of discussion on the FX issue. I just want to get a conclusion. You're basically saying that most of the P&amp;L impact would be hedged naturally or explicitly. So I'm trying to get comfort with thinking that the FX volatility won't move the needle in the bottom line on the P&amp;L. Is that fair?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">We are -- basically, it's self-hedged. When you take a look at the impact on our revenue and our expense and the cost of credit, we basically -- the business is basically self-hedged against FX exposure. So we'll get, depending upon how the dollar moves, we'll get either a very small impact, positive or negative, on the bottom line. But it does have an impact on the individual lines, and that's why when people look at expenses, just separate out just their view on expenses, that's going to color your view on expenses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Peter Ganucheau </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">So maybe just think about expense as FX? I mean, I don't know. Okay, and then the second one is a mathematical...</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">That would clearly be a way to look at it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Peter Ganucheau </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Okay. And the second point I have is the question on some math. I've got $992 billion of risk-weighted assets, 72% you said is Citicorp. That's $714 billion. Now your old guidance on the risk-weighted asset inflation would have been 35%. The new guidance is 20%. Do a little math, I won't take you through it, but the delta is $108 billion in risk-weighted assets. At 9.5% Tier 1 common, let's say it's a 7 plus to 250 [ph] , that's $11.3 billion in incremental excess capital that's freed up. And that's 10% of your market cap and the stock is flat. So I must be doing my math wrong. So what am I doing wrong?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">The only thing that struck me as you went through that is by the end of 2012, we would certainly expect to have some growth in our Citicorp assets because we are growing that business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Peter Ganucheau </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Okay. Fair enough. Holdings is there, but it's running off, right? But even if you include the increased inflation at Holdings, it still, it would cut that effect in half, but it's still noticeable.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">I know we've been through expenses a lot, and you said the net effect is the positive $100 million on income. But what is the revenue number? You said the weaker dollar contributed $1.6 billion or $1.9 billion increase in the first half versus the prior year. How much did the weaker dollar add to the revenue line item?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">I don't have that for you, Michael. I'm sorry. As I said, the net impact for the full firm is roughly $100 million pretax.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Okay. Linked quarter, your revenues were down $0.5 billion and your expenses were up $0.5 billion. FX is going to impact both. You said legal hurts that some, but it still looks like it's going to be negative operating leverage. And you said you're doing a degree of investment spending that should pay off for Asia in the fourth quarter and Transaction Services next year and U.S. Consumer Bank second half to next year. But of what you can control in expenses, where do you think you need to do better than you've been doing? Or is it that just the way it's going to be because you're in an investment mode?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Well, we are clearly in an investment mode and we -- look, I think you can always do things better. But we're definitely focused on driving those productivity saves. And so we're very focused on managing the business as we go forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">You gave us an isolation where each segment should turn to a positive operating leverage mode. When do you think the overall firm would be in a positive operating leverage status? Is that the end of this year, next year, 2013?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">I'm sorry, Michael. But when you consider with holdings and everything else, I'm not prepared to pick a time frame.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Sure. Let me shift gears. The net $13 billion of exposure to the European countries identified, what is the gross number and what's the difference between the gross and the net?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">I don't think that the gross number is relevant. I mean again, we're taking a look at the net exposure after hedges and appropriate risk management approaches.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Okay. So after collateral, and what else would be included in risk management?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Hedges, collateral, outside guarantees. I mean, I'm just trying to kind of run through an inventory.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Okay. And having gone through the crisis and having seen a lot of outside guarantees and hedges not working, how comfortable are you that you have the right hedges and risk management in place?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Vikram Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Well, it's reported. And if we report it as net exposure, it's based on our confidence that we are -- we consider these to be true hedges. By the way, just the only thing I'd add is John Gerspach talked about collateral, its net of collateral. It's -- there are types of collateral that don't get netted. Suppose you had a -- if you had a loan in one of these countries and the collateral was a lot of, let's say, U.S. corporate bonds, that's not a qualified hedge necessarily. It doesn't come through the numbers. So we do have collateral of that sort too in some of these financial institutions numbers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Okay. And then lastly I saw that Jerry Grundhofer stepped off the board 3 weeks ago after having pretty recently been renominated. Can you add any color to what was said in some of the public statements? He was in charge of the Risk Committee as I understand it. Who's the new head of the Risk Committee? Why did he leave?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Vikram Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">We will make those announcements in terms of changes post our board meeting that's coming up. So that's in process. We are delighted with the board that we have. We have enormous amount of depth, both on the financial services side and the risk side. And Jerry was very clear, and our press releases were very clear in terms of his reasons for choosing what he wanted to do. And we really think that we all have come a very long way. He made substantial contributions, and the board is in good shape going forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Your next question comes from the line of Meredith Whitney from Meredith Whitney Advisors.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Unknown Analyst - </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">This is John Dunn [ph] actually. Just one last question on expenses. Can you give us a breakout of the comp versus noncomp in the investment bank, and just a sense of how that compares to last quarter, on last year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">No. We don't disclose comp versus noncomp in the investment bank.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Unknown Analyst - </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Okay. Just wanted to take a chance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Your last question comes from the line of Mike Holson [ph] with The Boston [ph] Company.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Unknown Analyst - </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Okay, I'm going use that opportunity to ask 2 quick ones. The first one's really easy. You mentioned there's a gain from the sale of HDFC. Approximately how much was that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Pretax, it was roughly $200 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Unknown Analyst - </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Okay. And then I'm just going to follow up on Mike Mayo's question about the gross PIIGS exposure. I understand the reasons why you guys don't want to disclose it, but having seen the [indiscernible] before, if Europe turns into a real problem, the net exposure guidance or disclosure you gave isn't going to give investors any comfort whatsoever. So I would encourage you guys to give the gross exposure at some point if you're not going to do it today.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Okay, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">There are no further questions at this time. Presenters, do you have any closing remarks?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>John Andrews</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Yes. It's John Andrews. Thank you for those of you who just managed to stay on for this lengthy call. The replay will be available later this afternoon on the website.

The call will be hosted by John Andrews, Head of Citi Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions] Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Mr. Andrews, you may begin.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>John Andrews</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Rachel, thank you. And good morning to everybody, and thank you for joining us today. On the call today our CEO, Vikram Pandit, will speak first. Then, John Gerspach, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. After which, we'd be happy to take your questions. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results and capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our form -- 2010 Form 10-K. With that out of the way, let me turn it over to Vikram.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">John, thank you, and good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us today. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Earlier today, we announced net income of $3.8 billion or $1.23 per share for the third quarter. When you exclude CVA and focus on our operating results, we earned $2.6 billion or $0.84 per share. These are solid results, particularly in a macro environment in which economic and political uncertainty created a lot of market volatility. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">As always, we're managing through short-term challenges while steadily executing our long-term strategy. Over the past few years, we have methodically positioned Citi for the trends and opportunities we see in the world. We've built substantial financial strength, de-risked our balance sheet and reoriented our business back to what we do best and what's in Citi's DNA, being a uniquely global bank focused on capital flows and global trade, with a particular focus on the emerging markets. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">I want to start by focusing on 4 areas: first, our risk as it pertains to Europe, the emerging markets and the U.S. mortgages; second, our decision to move retail partner cards out of Citi Holdings and into Citicorp; third, our financial strength; fourth, I want to provide you some detail on our ongoing efforts to manage expenses; and I will close with a few comments on the economic environment. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">I believe that Citi's performance during this quarter shows the significant progress we have made in improving our risk management, one of my top priorities when I became CEO. We've completely revamped our risk profile, risk approach and most importantly, our risk culture. We've put in place robust practices in the businesses and regions to integrate risk analysis into decision-making. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Today, you have another example of this improved risk management in the update on our European exposure. More than 18 months ago, we recognized the potential for Greece's sovereign debt issues to impact other countries in the Eurozone. Since then, we have reduced our exposures where needed, while continuing to serve our clients diligently. As you will see, we have continued to closely manage our trading and AFS portfolios in the GIIPS, France and Belgium and currently, have no material net exposure to sovereign debt securities. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In terms of funded exposures, we have net lending exposures to the GIIPS sovereign entities of $1.5 billion, and we currently don't have any France and Belgium net sovereign lending exposure. Our GIIPS financial institution net lending exposure is $2.1 billion, and our France and Belgium financial institution net lending exposure is $2.3 billion. Our exposures include lending to foreign subsidiaries where applicable. Margin may be held against some exposures, reducing our net exposure, while other exposures are collateralized. We are providing that margin and collateral information as well. Lastly, our exposures to corporates are partly driven by global banking, and a large amount of these exposures are to large multinationals that participate in global trade [ph] and capital flows. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Today, we are also including a good amount of information regarding our consumer banking businesses in the emerging markets. Our deep roots in these markets give us sufficient advantages in growing and managing these businesses and managing our credit risk. These businesses continue to produce strong growth in revenues, loans and deposits. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Our credit portfolio in the emerging markets is diversified by country and by product. The credit quality in these portfolios is not only good, in fact, in most of the countries where we do business, it's even better than the U.S. And the credit margins we earn in these markets are substantially better than the margins the industry earns in the U.S. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">One sign of our success on these markets is that our investment spending in Asia is paying off. We achieved positive operating leverage in our Asian consumer business this quarter, one quarter ahead of when we expected it. We expect our Latin American consumer business to follow next quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">I did say last year that it was unlikely for the emerging markets to continue at their current pace. That said, we still expect them to grow faster than the developed markets. And also, the individual markets are not monolithic, each country faces its own opportunities and trends. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We continue to be very transparent about our U.S. mortgage exposure. We have a smaller owned mortgage portfolio than any peer. Because of our aggressive risk mitigation efforts, which includes selling mortgages, our portfolio has shrunk faster than any peer. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">And in a period of uncertainty, we believe that we hold the largest reserves against that portfolio. We have the smallest servicing portfolio and the smallest securitization portfolio of any peer. While we continue to focus on the risk of mortgage portfolio, particularly if the economy were to weaken, I feel very good about all the steps we have taken and how we are positioned today. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Regarding Citi Holdings, we've decided to move the vast majority of our retail partner cards business to Citicorp. We have made a lot of progress in strengthening this portfolio, including shedding some assets and re-underwriting the portfolio to much higher credit standards. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">The portfolio is now 2/3 of its size at its peak, with an average balance weighted FICO of more than 700. In addition, so far this year, this business has earned a $2.2 billion profit before taxes and is a powerful source of ongoing profits. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">As importantly, the credit card business and the availability of credit have changed since the enactment of the CARD Act, consumer behavior has also changed, as branded cards carry smaller open lines and consumers would rather use retail cards to preserve and protect their open lines of credit with banks. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">With this transfer, pro forma holdings assets will total about $250 billion or 13% of Citi's balance sheet. Although we continue to analyze the holdings portfolio, we don't expect any other transfers of this magnitude, and our goal is to get holdings below 10% of the balance sheet in the near future. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Next, Citi has built unquestionable financial strength over the past several years. At the end of the third quarter, our Tier 1 common ratio was 11.7%, and we had approximately $145 billion in tangible common equity. Almost 25% of our balance sheet is cash or liquid securities. We have enough liquidity that we could operate without issuing long-term debt for a couple of years, although we still plan to participate in the debt markets. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We still expect to end 2012 with the 8% to 9% Basel III Tier 1 common ratio and meet the Basel III capital requirements ahead of schedule. Subject to regulatory approval, we still plan to begin returning capital to shareholders next year, and we believe the pace of return can increase in 2013 and beyond, as economic conditions improve and we continue to reduce holdings assets and monetize our deferred tax assets. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Let me spend a minute on expenses. Third quarter expenses were $12.5 billion in total, down 4% from the second quarter. After the big reductions in headcount and cost over the last couple of years, we continued to actively manage our expense base. We are constantly assessing our performance and will continue to resize our businesses when necessary. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Looking forward, we expect our fourth quarter expenses to be roughly flat, although the impact from episodic items such as FX and legal costs are not predictable. Also, compensation will continue to hinge on performance. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Finally, as I have said before, the macro will dominate the micro, but we are encouraged by the results driven by the methodical execution of our strategy. Regardless of any cyclical slowdowns in the emerging markets, we think the secular trends, such as trade and rising consumption in the emerging markets, will persevere, and we will pace our investments accordingly. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In the developed markets, growth is likely to be slow for years. We remain concerned about the U.S. housing market, and the U.S. residential mortgage portfolios of most banks remain the greatest risk. John will now take you through the presentation, and as John Andrews said before, we'll come back to answer your questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Thank you, Vikram, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 2. Citigroup reported third quarter net income of $3.8 billion or $1.23 per diluted share. This quarter's results included significant CVA of $1.9 billion, driven by Citi's credit spreads widening. Excluding CVA, earnings were $2.6 billion or $0.84 per share in the third quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Revenues of $20.8 billion were roughly flat versus the prior year on a reported basis. Excluding CVA from both periods, revenues were down 8%, as continued strong growth in international consumer banking and Transaction Services was more than offset by lower revenues in Citi Holdings, Securities and Banking, and North America Consumer Banking. Expenses of $12.5 billion were up 8% year-over-year and down 4% from last quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Year-over-year, roughly 3 quarters of the increase was driven by the impact of foreign exchange, higher legal and related costs and the absence of one-time benefits in the prior period. Excluding these items, operating expenses grew 2% year-over-year in the third quarter, driven by higher investments, partially offset by productivity savings and other expense reductions. I'll discuss year-to-date expenses in more detail later. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Cost of credit continued to improve year-over-year, down 43% to $3.4 billion. Sequentially, end of period loans declined 2% for Citigroup. However, reported loans included a net negative impact from foreign exchange in the third quarter. On a constant dollar basis, total Citigroup loans were up 1% sequentially, as loan growth in Citicorp more than offset the decline in Citi Holdings. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On Slide 3, we highlight significant items affecting the third quarter and comparable periods. As I mentioned earlier, CVA was a significant factor this quarter, at $1.9 billion pretax compared to $164 million in the second quarter and $115 million in the third quarter of last year. The $1.9 billion of CVA this quarter included $1.6 billion of CVA on Citi's fair value option debt and roughly $300 million of derivative CVA net of hedges. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In the second quarter of 2011, we also recorded over $0.5 billion of realized gains on the sale of assets transferred out of held to maturity in the Special Asset Pool. And in the third quarter of last year, we had a net loss on the announced sale of Student Loan Corporation of $800 million. Finally, turning to loan loss reserves, we recorded a significantly lower net reserve release in the third quarter of 2011, at $1.4 billion versus $2 billion both last quarter and in the prior year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning now to Citicorp and Citi Holdings on Slide 4. Citicorp reported revenues of $17.7 billion and net income of $4.6 billion in the third quarter. Versus last year, Citicorp loans grew 13% on a reported basis, including 6% growth in consumer and 21% growth in corporate loans. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As I mentioned earlier, in the third quarter, international loan growth reflects a negative impact from foreign exchange. Loans originated in foreign currencies are translated back to U.S. dollars for reporting purposes, and therefore, as the U.S. dollar appreciates, our reported loan balances are reduced. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Excluding the impact of FX, we grew loans in every business in Citicorp in the third quarter, both year-over-year and sequentially. Citi Holdings reported revenues of $2.8 billion and a net loss of $802 million. Citi Holdings ended the quarter with $289 billion of assets, down $19 billion during the quarter and $132 billion year-over-year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On Slide 5, we show a 9-quarter trend for Citicorp's results. Excluding CVA, Citicorp's revenues of $15.8 billion in the third quarter were down 2% versus the prior quarter and prior year, as growth in Regional Consumer Banking and Transaction Services was more than offset by lower revenues in Securities and Banking. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Operating expenses of $9.8 billion were up 9% versus the prior year and down 3% from last quarter. Year-over-year, roughly 1/4 of the increase resulted from the impact of foreign exchange. The remainder was primarily driven by investment spending, offset by productivity savings and other expense reductions. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Citicorp's net credit losses were $1.9 billion, down 36% from the prior year, driven by Citi-branded cards in North America. We released $585 million in net loan loss reserves, up from $426 million last year, due to higher net releases in Citi-branded cards, partially offset by lower releases in International Consumer Banking and a net build in the corporate portfolio, each driven by loan growth. Excluding CVA, earnings before taxes of $4.6 billion were roughly flat versus last year, as lower revenues and higher operating expenses were offset by lower credit costs. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Slide 6 shows the results for North America Consumer Banking. Revenues of $3.4 billion were down 9% versus last year, mainly due to a decline in average cards loans, lower mortgage revenues and the impact of the look-back provisions of CARD Act. Sequentially, revenues were up slightly again this quarter by 2%. Expenses of $1.8 billion were up 24% year-over-year and 2% sequentially, as we continued to make investments largely through higher marketing and technology spending. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Year-over-year expense growth also reflects the absence of a one-time benefit in the prior period. Credit costs declined 75% from last year to $509 million. Net credit losses were down 41% to $1.2 billion, driven by Citi-branded cards, and the reserve release was $653 million this quarter. Net credit margin grew by 28% year-over-year to $2.3 billion. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Earnings before tax, excluding the impact of loan loss reserves, grew by 45% to $445 million in the third quarter. This measure is one of the most relevant metrics for consumer businesses as year-over-year net income comparisons are often significantly skewed by reserve actions. For the second consecutive quarter, we grew both card accounts and end of period loans on a sequential basis. Year-over-year, purchase sales and card accounts both grew by 2%. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Turning to our International Consumer Banking businesses on Slide 7. First is, as Vikram mentioned, Asia achieved positive operating leverage in the third quarter, with revenue growth of 13% and expense growth of 9% year-over-year. In total, international revenues were $4.9 billion in the third quarter, up 10% versus last year, with growth in all regions. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Year-over-year revenue growth reflected continued improvement in underlying drivers, as well as the benefit from foreign exchange. Spread compression continued to be a headwind in the third quarter, but it is abating. On a sequential basis, revenues were roughly flat, as 2% underlying growth was offset by a net negative impact from foreign exchange. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On average, during the quarter, the dollar appreciated versus local currencies in EMEA and Latin America, resulting in a negative impact on reported revenues. In Asia, the sequential impact of FX was small. Expenses were $2.9 billion in the third quarter, up 12% versus last year, with over 1/3 of the increase due to the impact of foreign exchange. The remainder primarily reflects higher investment spending in volume-related costs, partially offset by continued productivity savings. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">A lower net reserve release resulted in an increase in credit cost at $720 million versus $352 million last year. Net credit losses declined 9% to $691 million, while the reserve release was just $9 million this quarter versus $440 million last year. Net credit margin of $4.1 billion was up 14% year-over-year. Earnings before tax, excluding the impact of loan loss reserves, grew by 20% to $1.2 billion. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On Slide 8, we show growth trends for International Consumer Banking in more detail. Year-over-year, we continued to show growth in all major drivers. However, as I mentioned, sequentially, this quarter was negatively affected by the impact of foreign exchange. We provide more detail for these drivers on a constant dollar basis in the Appendix, in Slides 43 and 44. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On a reported basis, average deposits and loans grew by 11% and 16% year-over-year, respectively. Investment sales were up 1% versus last year, and card purchases grew 20%. On a trailing 12-month basis, we have grown both net credit margin and pretax earnings, excluding the impact of loan loss reserves, in every quarter for 2 years. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On Slide 9, we take a closer look at our international consumer loans. Our portfolio is well diversified by country and product. At the end of the third quarter, 10 countries represented nearly 85% of our loan book, and our largest markets are Korea and Mexico. By product, over 75% of loans were to retail customers, mostly mortgages and credit cards. And close to 1/4 of the book was local commercial loans, mostly, again, in Korea and Mexico. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On Slide 10, we go into more detail on our Asia consumer portfolio. Asia consumer banking represented nearly $85 billion of loans at the end of the third quarter, with over 80% in emerging markets. As we have grown our loans in Asia in a careful and consistent manner, with strict underwriting criteria and the benefit of decades of local experience in these markets. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Structurally, the region continues to mature with full credit bureaus in almost every country. Mortgages represented roughly 40% of the portfolio, with the largest emerging market exposures in Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong. Our emerging market mortgage business in Asia is relationship-driven. As a result, the majority of loans are with borrowers who also have a retail banking relationship with Citi. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">LTVs are relatively low in the region and are capped by regulatory limits in most markets. In Korea, for example, LTVs are capped at 60%. In Singapore, LTVs are tapped at 80%. And in Hong Kong, LTVs are capped at 50% to 70% based on property value. In each of these 3 portfolios, Citi's average updated LTV is roughly 50% or lower. Mortgages in these markets are also full recourse. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">As a result of the high quality of our borrowers and low LTVs in the region, our average historical NCL rate for mortgages in Asia has been close to 0%. Cards represented nearly 1/4 of Asia loans with the largest emerging market exposures in Taiwan, Korea and Malaysia. Our cards portfolio in Asia is well seasoned, with historical average NCL rates in these emerging markets of roughly 3% to 4% over the last 10 years. As we consider new card originations, our target is to generate operating income of at least 2x steady-state NCLs. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Turning to Slide 11. We show more detail on Latin America. Latin America consumer banking represented $35 billion of loans at the end of the third quarter. Mexico was over 60% of the total, and Brazil was roughly 20% of loans. Cards represented 37% of the portfolio, with an NCL rate of 8.4% in the third quarter. Mexico cards is roughly $5 billion and has been repositioned over the past 3 years, with a focus on tighter underwriting criteria and increased penetration of our existing retail base. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Through the third quarter, early-stage delinquencies for recent originations were tracking better than targets and were at roughly 50% of the '07 and '08 vintage levels. Similar to Asia, our target is to generate operating margin on new originations of at least 2x the steady-state NCLs. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Brazil cards is roughly $4.6 billion and has migrated to a higher percentage of transactors who tend to have better credit quality. The Brazil market is facing regulatory changes, including a significant increase in the minimum payment due, which will continue to put pressure on NCL rates in the near term. However, we currently believe the underlying credit quality of our portfolio remains stable. Commercial loans are about 31% of the portfolio, mostly in Mexico where NCLs have averaged less than 1% over the past 2 years. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Slide 12 shows the performance of Citi-branded cards by region since 2008. Revenues per average loan are shown on the blue lines, and NCL rates are in red. The green space in between represents the net credit margin for each region through the cycle. As you can see, we generate a substantial net credit margin in our international businesses. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">In Asia, revenue yields are lower than in Latin America. However, the region also benefits from significantly lower NCL rates, resulting in a relatively stable net credit margin through the cycle. In Latin America, revenue yields have come down slightly from early '08 levels, reflecting the migration to higher quality borrowers. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">NCL rates are higher in Latin America and were more volatile during the recent cycle. However, the lowest net credit margin was still over 10% in the third quarter of 2009. In North America, net credit margins are beginning to recover but remain compressed versus precrisis levels. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Slide 13 shows our securities and banking business. Excluding CVA, revenues of $4.8 billion were down 12% from last year and down 9% versus the prior quarter. In investment banking, revenues of $736 million were down 32% sequentially, driven by lower activity levels across all products. X CVA, equity market revenues of $289 million were down 63% sequentially. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">While cash equity revenues were relatively stable, we had weak trading performance in our equity derivatives business. We also incurred losses in principal strategies, driven in part by the ongoing wind down of its positions. Fixed Income Market revenues, x CVA, were down 22% sequentially, to $2.3 billion as strong growth in rates and currencies was more than offset by lower revenues in credit-related and securitized Products. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Lending revenues were $1 billion, up from $356 million last quarter due to gains on hedges. Private Bank revenues, excluding CVA, were down 2% sequentially to $545 million. Total operating expenses of $3.6 billion were down 1% from last year and down 8% sequentially. Year-over-year, higher investment spending was more than offset by lower incentive compensation expense and ongoing productivity savings. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Quarter-over-quarter, the decline was largely driven by lower incentive compensation expense.  Credit costs were $174 million in the third quarter, down from $279 million last year on lower net credit losses, partially offset by a reserve build this quarter due to growth in corporate loans and commitments. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Moving to Transaction Services on Slide 14. Revenues of $2.7 billion were up 7% from the third quarter of last year, driven by international growth. Treasury and trade solutions was up 5%, primarily due to higher trade revenues and increased deposits, partially offset by the impact of the continued low rate environment. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Securities and funds services grew 11% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in transaction and settlement volumes, as well as new client mandates. Transaction volumes and new mandates continued to show momentum in both businesses. Asset growth was driven by trade loans, with average trade assets up over 50% from last year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Average deposits were up 7% year-over-year to $365 billion. Assets under custody were up 1% year-over-year to $12.5 trillion, but were down 7% from the prior quarter due to a negative impact from foreign exchange and lower market values. Expenses of $1.4 billion were up 17% versus last year, reflecting higher volumes and continued investments, partially offset by productivity savings. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">On Slide 15, we show a 9-quarter trend for Citi Holdings. The loss in Citi Holdings was $802 million in the third quarter, up from a loss of $218 million in the second quarter, driven by the absence of gains in the Special Asset Pool. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Revenues were down 27% year-over-year to $2.8 billion, due primarily to lower assets. Operating expenses of $2.1 billion were down 6% versus last year, and total credit costs were down 40% to $2 billion. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Looking at Citi Holdings in a bit more detail on Slide 16. Revenues in Brokerage and Asset Management were $55 million this quarter, up from last year due to the absence of private equity marks in the prior period. In Local Consumer Lending, revenues were down 15% versus last year to $3 billion, driven by declining loan balances. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">In the Special Asset Pool, revenues were negative $227 million in the third quarter. These results were driven by negative net interest revenue as interest-earning assets are becoming a smaller portion of the Special Asset Pool, while we continue to incur funding costs on the total portfolio.  Noninterest revenue was only $8 million this quarter compared to nearly $1.2 billion last quarter, which included over $0.5 billion of gains realized on the sale of assets, which had been transferred out of held to maturity earlier this year, as well as realized gains on other assets dispositions. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Operating expenses were down 6% year-over-year to $2.1 billion due to declining assets. Credit costs were down 40% year-over-year to $2 billion, as credit trends continued to improve in both the consumer and corporate portfolios. Total net credit losses were down 44% to $2.6 billion, as we released $838 million of net loan loss reserves in Citi Holdings. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Slide 17 shows Citi Holdings assets. We ended the quarter with $289 billion in Citi Holdings or 15% of total Citigroup assets. The $19 billion reduction in the third quarter was comprised of roughly $10 billion of asset sales and business dispositions, approximately $7 billion of net runoff and pay downs and roughly $2 billion of net cost of credit and net asset marks. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Slide 18 shows the results for the Corporate/Other segment. Revenues declined by $296 million versus last year, mainly driven by lower investment yields, lower gains on sales of AFS securities and hedging activities. Expenses were up by $217 million versus last year, mainly due to legal and related costs, and infrastructure investments. Assets of $283 billion include approximately $93 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $121 billion of liquid available-for-sale securities. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Turning to total Citigroup expenses on Slide 19. Year-to-date in 2011, expenses totaled $37.7 billion, up 8% from $34.9 billion in the same period last year. Nearly 2/3 of the increase resulted from the impact of foreign exchange translation and episodic-driven expenses. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">On a year-over-year basis, the impact of the weakening U.S. dollar resulted in roughly $1 billion of higher expenses. Legal and related costs were $1.1 billion higher, as compared to last year. And other episodic items were a net benefit of around $200 million, including the absence of the U.K. bonus tax in the second quarter of 2010. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">On an operating basis, our expenses were up by $1 billion or just under 3% year-to-date. Investment spending was $2.8 billion higher in the first 9 months of 2011, which I'll discuss more of in a minute. We funded roughly half of these investments with efficiency savings of $1.4 billion year-over-year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">All other operating expenses, including higher volume-related costs, were more than offset by a decline in Citi Holdings expenses. Excluding foreign exchange and episodic-driven costs, our expenses year-to-date would have been $35.9 billion. As we look to the full year, we expect operating expenses, excluding the impact of FX and legal and related costs and other episodic items that we simply cannot control, to be towards the lower end of our previously disclosed guidance of $48 billion to $50 billion. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Now I'll spend a moment on our investments and efficiency savings. As shown in Slide 20, year-to-date, we have invested close to $3.2 billion in 2011. As you may remember, we ramped up our investment program towards the end of the second quarter of 2010. So relative to last year, we have increased investments by $2.8 billion. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Roughly 60% of the total investments year-to-date were revenue generating, such as incremental cards marketing campaigns, new branches and key hires. Another 20% related to ongoing investments in risk management, finance and compliance systems, as well as the need to respond to new regulations. Finally, about 20% of investments relate to enhancing our technology and infrastructure to become more efficient and productive. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">We are seeing good results from our efforts to become a more efficient company. Our reengineering program has yielded close to $1.4 billion in savings year-to-date. On an ongoing basis, our efficiency goal is to eliminate 3% to 5% of our expenses each year. On an expense base of roughly $48 billion to $50 billion, this equates to around $2 billion of ongoing efficiency savings annually. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Slide 21 shows total Citigroup net credit losses and loan loss reserves. NCLs continued to improve in the third quarter, down 12% sequentially to $4.5 billion. And the net LLR release was $1.4 billion versus $2 billion in the prior quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">We ended the quarter with $32.1 billion of total loan loss reserves, and our LLR ratio was 5.1%. Consumer NCLs declined 12% sequentially to $4.2 billion, and we released $1.2 billion in net loan loss reserves. Corporate credit costs were $86 million in the third quarter compared to a benefit of $104 million last quarter. Corporate net credit losses were down 22% sequentially to $272 million. However, we had a smaller reserve release, as a release in Citi Holdings was partially offset by a build in Citicorp to reflect continued growth in corporate loans and loan commitments. Corporate non-accrual loans of $4.2 billion were down 14% versus the prior quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Slide 22 shows our international consumer credit trends. The NCL rate remained fairly stable in Asia at just over 1% in the third quarter. NCLs continued to improve in Latin America, driven by Mexico cards. Delinquency rates also improved in both regions. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">On Slide 23, we show our North America cards portfolios. In Citi-branded cards, the NCL rate continued to improve in the third quarter, down 87 basis points to under 6%, and 90-plus day delinquencies were down to 1.4%. In retail partner cards, the NCL rate fell by 166 basis points to 7.5% this quarter, and 90-plus day delinquencies fell to under 2.5%. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">On Slide 24, we show the North America mortgage portfolio in Citi Holdings, split between residential first mortgages and home equity loans. NCLs improved in both portfolios in the third quarter, and 90-plus day delinquencies declined as well, although at a slower pace than prior periods. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">In residential first mortgages, we ended the quarter with $70 billion of loans, down 18% from a year ago. Sequentially, 90-plus day delinquencies declined by 3% to $3.8 billion and net credit losses were down 5% to $437 million. The sequential decline in first mortgage delinquencies was entirely driven by asset sales, as we sold roughly $500 million of delinquent mortgages in the third quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">In recent quarters, both asset sales and the pace of modifications have slowed, as we have a smaller pool of eligible delinquent loans to sell or modify. This trend continued in the third quarter. At the same time, our early bucket delinquencies are beginning to increase, reflecting re-defaults of previously modified mortgages. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">As the result of these converging trends, we could begin to see increasing delinquencies in net credit losses in the first mortgage portfolio. However, expectations for re-defaults and a resulting increase in net credit losses are already factored into our net loan loss reserve balance. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">In home equity loans, we ended the quarter with $41 billion of loans, down 13% from a year ago. Sequentially, 90-plus day delinquencies declined by 2% to $1 billion and net credit losses were down 14% to $542 million. As I mentioned earlier, the pace of improvement in our home equity delinquencies has slowed. While net credit losses on the portfolio continued to decline through the third quarter, we are watching these trends closely. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">We ended the quarter with roughly $10 billion of our total loan loss reserves allocated to North America real estate lending in Citi Holdings or over 30 months of coincidental NCL coverage. Adding to the potential risks surrounding North America mortgages is the continued economic uncertainty, high unemployment and the potential for further housing price declines. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">On Slide 25, we show a consolidated view of North America consumer mortgages, including both Citi Holdings and Citicorp. Our total NCL rate declined to 2.8% in the quarter, and 90-plus day delinquencies were roughly flat at 3.9%. For our total North America consumer mortgage portfolio, our reserves cover 30 months of NCLs. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">On Slide 26, we address 3 additional mortgage-related topics. First is our third-party servicing book. At the end of the third quarter, we serviced $421 billion of loans for third parties and we retained the rep and warranty liabilities on another $27 billion of sold servicing. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Our repurchased reserve totaled $1.1 billion at the end of the third quarter. This reserve is up from $969 million at the beginning of the year, as we utilized $548 million of the reserves and built an additional $642 million year-to-date. Second is the volume of our private label RMBS issuance. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Citi was a relatively small issuer of private label RMBS, with total issuance of roughly $91 billion during 2005 through 2008. We issued $25 billion in Citi mortgage. Since issuance, this amount has been reduced by roughly $13 billion of repayment and recoveries and $1 billion of cumulative losses. The remaining $11 billion outstanding has a 90-plus day delinquency rate of 12.5%. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We also issued $66 billion through our Securities and Banking business. Since issuance, this amount has been reduced by roughly $34 billion of repayment and recoveries and $8 billion of cumulative losses. The remaining $24 billion outstanding has a 90-plus day delinquency rate of 26.6%. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">The last topic is FHA origination and the potential risks related to government-guaranteed loans. Over the past 3 years, Citi cut its FHA origination volumes dramatically. From 2008 -- 2005 through 2008, we represented roughly 7% of the market. In 2009, this level dropped to roughly 3%. And since 2010, Citi has represented less than 1% of industry FHA origination. More broadly, as Vikram mentioned earlier, we believe mortgages and related issues are among the biggest risks facing U.S. banks today, particularly in the face of an uncertain economic environment. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">On Slide 27, we summarize our country risk exposure to Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain, noted here as GIIPS, as well as France and Belgium. At the end of the third quarter, Citi's gross funded exposure to GIIPS was $20.6 billion, and our combined gross funded exposure to France and Belgium was $14.4 billion. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Netted against our gross funded exposure, we have margin posted under legally enforceable margin agreements, collateral pledged under bankruptcy remote structures and purchased credit protection from financial institutions.  These amounts totaled $13.5 billion for GIIPS and $12.4 billion for France and Belgium. Credit protection has been purchased from high-quality financial institutions predominantly outside of these 7 countries. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Net of margin, collateral and purchased credit protection, our net current funded exposure to GIIPS at the end of the third quarter was $7.1 billion, and our net funded exposure to France and Belgium was $2 billion. We also hold collateral totaling $4.4 billion for GIIPS and $4.1 billion for France and Belgium, which have not been netted from these amounts. We continue to carefully manage these exposures, while servicing our important clients in these countries. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">In summary, we produced good results in light of a very challenging operating environment this quarter. Let me close with some comments about our outlook for various businesses. Our greatest performance challenge this quarter was in Securities and Banking, reflecting very difficult market conditions, but also weak performance in our equities business. It's obviously difficult to forecast operating conditions for this business in the coming quarters, but global macro and economic uncertainty will likely weigh on operating results in the near term. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">As we navigate the uncertain environment, we will remain focused on servicing our clients, while controlling risk carefully. As is the case with all of our businesses, we actively manage our expenses, and we'll be carefully calibrating compensation levels to performance. We will also ensure that the overall size and positioning of our Securities and Banking business reflects the opportunities we see going forward. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">In Transaction Services, we expect continued revenue growth into next year, as our investments generate underlying growth to offset the headwind of spread compression. Even in a continued low rate environment, we currently anticipate achieving positive operating leverage in Transaction Services by the second or third quarter of 2012. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">In North America Consumer Banking, we continue to benefit from declining credit costs this quarter. However, these improvements will likely slow into next year, as we approach more normalized levels. Absent a material weakening of the U.S. economy, we currently anticipate achieving positive operating leverage in North America Consumer Banking by the end of 2012. This is about 1 year behind our consumer businesses in Asia and Latin America, as we began our investment program in North America more recently. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">In International Consumer Banking, we achieved positive operating leverage in Asia this quarter and expect to do so in Latin America in the fourth quarter. This reflects underlying growth in these markets, as well as our investment spending and the strength of our franchise in these regions. Credit quality in most of these markets has largely recovered, and we anticipate slight increases in dollar NCLs and delinquencies as our portfolios continued to grow and season.  As Vikram noted in his opening comments, we are very focused on managing credit risk in these markets, and we feel very good about the quality and diversity of our portfolios. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Turning to Citi Holdings. The transfer of retail partner cards into Citicorp will obviously shrink the assets in Citi Holdings, but it will also affect the earnings profile of the remaining business. As you know, we said back in March 2010 that within Local Consumer Lending, our existing reserves, plus expected pre-provision net revenue, would be sufficient to cover expected lifetime losses in the existing portfolio. We continue to believe this is true, even with the transfer of retail partner cards out of Local Consumer Lending, although, as always, this assumes no further downturn in the U.S. economy. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Our major focus in Citi Holdings will remain on managing the risks inherent in the U.S. mortgage portfolio. We expect ongoing weakness in U.S. housing into the middle of next year. Foreclosure backlogs continue to grow, and the economic outlook is uncertain. Additionally, litigation and regulatory risk will remain high in the mortgage business, although given the size of our portfolios, we believe our exposure is smaller than peers. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Regarding expenses, as Vikram said, we anticipate fourth quarter expenses, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and legal and related costs, to be roughly flat to this quarter. Since we started our restructuring in 2008, we have been extraordinarily focused on expenses, and we'll remain so. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">That said, we also have real growth opportunities in many of our businesses, and we will pursue those with prudent investment spending. As I just noted, we're beginning to see the benefits of those investments, and we anticipate achieving positive operating leverage in more of our key businesses over the next year or so. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">That concludes our review, and Vikram and I will now be happy to take your questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p11\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Nomura.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Curious, John, your comments on reshaping the investment bank for the opportunities that you see, obviously, in a tougher revenue environment now. But expenses have been elevated there. I'm just curious. What drives the decision, meaning, if you go there and you shrink a little? Is it Basel III? Is it Volcker's? Is it the derivatives rules? What are the main drivers that's going to bring rethinking on the IB or Securities and Banking?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Glenn, let me answer that. It's a Vikram. And I think, yes, it's all of the above. You've got to start right there, which is Basel III, Volcker are definitely going to have an impact on the kind of business you're in, the credit business like securitization, some of the derivatives business. Those that are non-clearinghouse, counterparty business are going to be affected by that. You've got to scale for that. That's important. On the other hand, the expenses are going to be higher because if you want to be in clearinghouses, you got to make sure the systems are set up. So on one hand, you reduce the business. On the other hand, on a getting-ready-for-it basis, the expenses are higher. And none of us truly know where the Volcker rules are going to come out. They are going to have an impact. We need to watch that, but in our own case, as I'm sure elsewhere, we've been getting ready for that, making sure that we can comply with the definitions of proprietary trading and other activities. So those are clearly the cases. The bigger issue is whether we all are going to see a secular change in the level of activity in those businesses. You and I know that's really hard to predict, and we all are living in an environment where the interest rates are 2%. And on the other hand, we're expecting some of these businesses to return some very good rates of return. Now how that all squares, we're going to have to see. And that's probably the most uncertain part. The part that we're more certain about is that capital markets activities, albeit slowly and albeit in a smaller volume to date are moving to the emerging markets. It's the emerging market companies that are doing the IPOs. It's the emerging market companies that are going to need issuance of debt and all of the M&amp;A that goes with that, and that's one of those businesses that we are investing against as a company. So you can see it sort of a picture with a lot of factors that are changing, which means that you got to be right on top of the business, making sure you're sizing the business correctly and optimizing it to where we think activity is going to come from and taking some guesses as to what the secular level of activity is going to be.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I appreciate that. Related matter, but a little different is, you had a lot of time to prepare for it, but can you talk about any direct impact you've seen on the downgrade to P2 by Moody's?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Glenn, so far we really haven't seen much of an impact, to be honest with you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Good to hear. So counter parties are hanging in, and trading partners have no issues?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">No, I mean, we've gotten so far what we expect. We know that there are some counterparties that by their charter can't do business with anybody who's less than a P1. And so that went away, and that's what we had expected to happen. And as you noted, it's something that we've been preparing for that possibility for some time. We've already got commercial paper even as of the second quarter. It was down to like $9 billion. I think we're like $6 billion or $7 billion right now. And that's -- we may dip a little bit more than that, but it's just not going to have that big of an impact. At least, it hasn't had that big of an impact on us as yet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I appreciate that, and maybe one last one. Just curious. The LCI jumped from $12 billion to $17 billion. I know spreads widened out a lot, but rates came down. Just curious if you can give us a little color behind the scenes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes, that's basically all due to currency translation adjustment, FAS 52 impacts.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question comes from John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">John, just following up on Glenn's last question there. So the FX currency translation did affect the growth in tangible book value this quarter, I guess, and also the Tier 1 ratio, as well?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Well, it has less of an impact on the Tier 1 ratio because we hedge to our Tier 1 ratio. So it does have an impact from a tangible book point of view. You've got the impact on both the capital accounts, but also don't forget you've got an impact on goodwill and intangibles as well. So that all sort of nets down to, I think, about a $3.5 billion impact on tangible book value. But from a Tier 1 ratio point of view, it doesn't impact our ratio because of the way that we hedge it out.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay, got you. Second question, the net interest margin and net interest income held in pretty well for you guys, okay, albeit a tough interest rate environment. What's your outlook for the NII and the NIM if we continue to model through a low growth environment here with low interest rates?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">NIM was up, I guess, 1 basis point this quarter, and obviously, there's a lots of ins and outs that go into NIM. I tend to -- I think you should focus on 2, let's say, 2 broad categories. One, movements in our loan portfolio. Again, as we've mentioned before, if Citi Holdings continues to shrink, some of our higher yielding loans are running off, and that NIM pressure is only somewhat offset by growth in the Citicorp loan portfolio. Especially as in a low interest rate environment and our strategy to lower the risk profile in our portfolios, we bring on new loans at lower rates. And if you think about the impact of Citi Holdings' higher yielding loans rolling off and lower yielding loans coming on, that was about a net hit to NIM of 3 basis points. So the second impact is our continued roll-off of long-term debt in the absence, this quarter, of certain borrowing costs that we had in the second quarter in our trading business associated with some rather specific client strategies. And as those client positions rolled off in the third quarter, so did those associated borrowing costs. So the second factor, the cost of the LTV and this higher financing costs rolling off, added about 4 basis points to our NIM. And so those 2 things sort of net out to the 1 basis point. So you asked about looking forward. Looking forward, absent some significant portfolio sale coming out of Holdings, our NIM is going to continue to reflect the pressure of a low interest rate environment and subsequent changes in our portfolio, and it's likely to come down by a couple of basis points each quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. And other banks retiring TruPS given that you have lots of capital on almost all metrics. I know presumably, you have high interest expense. Would you start to think about that as a strategy retiring the TruPS as well?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yes, that's something that we will continue to look at. There are some TruPS that we can call now, but our higher yielding TruPS require a regulatory event in order for us to put out a call provision on it. And so we're waiting to see when that regulatory event may occur.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. The last thing, just a clarification on your Basel III goals to be at 8% to 9% by the end of next year. Just to clarify, that's on a fully loaded basis. Is that correct?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. So that assumes all the numerator deductions that don't even start technically until 2014. Right? That those all hit immediately?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">That's on a fully phased in set of rules, yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So do you have an idea on an as-reported basis, what kind of Basel III number you may expect to be actually reporting on January 1, 2013?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">No, I'm not going to forecast our Basel III ratios.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. But it would be higher than the 8% to 9% obviously, correct?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">As I said Glenn (sic) [John], we expect to be between 8% and 9%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>James F. Mitchell - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">A quick question on -- follow-up on John's question on the Tier 1 common. The Tier 1 common dollars, it looks like it was basically flattish, I guess, when we look at risk-weighted assets. Just trying to figure out if there was not much of an impact from the FX translation. What kept it flat in the quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">The biggest impact, I mentioned the fact that the way we hedge. If you take a look at our risk-weighted assets on an x FX basis, our risk-weighted assets actually grew about $20 billion more than you would have expected just from a decline or just from an impact of the appreciating dollar. So if nothing else had changed, you would have expected our risk-weighted assets to have dropped by about $30 billion this quarter. And in fact, they only dropped by about $11 billion. So we had growth on our risk-weighted assets. And that comes from 3 basic factors. About 1/3 of that increase comes from loan growth, again, x FX. Risk-weighted assets associated with loans grew by about $7 billion in the quarter. Another $6 billion or $7 billion was risk-weighted asset growth in our trading book, that was driven by factoring in market volatility into the various models. And then the other 1/3 was a combination of repositioning some of our AFS securities and some of our reverses out of 0 risk-weighted assets into 20% or 50% risk-weighted assets. So those 3 factors kind of add up to the $20 billion worth of risk-weighted asset growth. And if you think about it, each -- as I think we put in the Q, each $10 billion of risk-weighted asset growth impacts our Tier 1 ratio by about 12 basis points. So that $20 billion generally would be somewhere around 24 basis points and I think the way the roundings work, you probably get an extra 3/10 increase in our published Tier 1 ratio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>James F. Mitchell - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. All right, I got that. And then maybe a follow-up on the expenses in the investment bank. If we look at year-to-date, clearly because of the tough environment, I think revenues are down x the DVA about 17%, but expenses are up 3%. Do you think that there's some more of -- you're sort of kind of guiding to flat expenses sequentially. But is there some room there if revenues were to remain weak to cut compensation at the end of the year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Let me say that we are focused on making sure expenses are in line with our performance, and frankly, compensation should be in line with performance, too. And it's too soon to talk about it, about the fourth quarter now, but we'll certainly have that in our mind next quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>James F. Mitchell - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. Fair enough. And one last question on the collateral. That's not netted in your disclosures. What's in there? Is it not just AAA collateral? What's the makeup of that type of collateral?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yes. No, those would be assets that we've got pledged, but we don't necessarily have sitting in bankruptcy remote vehicles where we have physical possessions of, so we have to go and get it. All right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">A couple of questions. One on the retail partner card, I think this is something that the market had been hoping for, for a while. Could you just give us a sense as to why now and was there any regulatory approvals that were required for this?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I think why now is really an answer to taking stock of what we've done to change the business, which is we shrunk the portfolio, improved the credit quality, and it's fully funded by our deposit base. Why now is also a result of understanding all the changes that came out of the CARD Act, and I think that one of the biggest changes coming out of the CARD Act is that bank open lines on branded cards had been rationalized, total amount of credit outstanding has been rationalized and that retail credit at point of sale is an important source of financing for people who are buying large items, such as those that are private label partners' supply. And so basically, consumer behavior has changed, and we think that this form of white label or private label credit is going to be important part of what drives consumer sales, and our corporate customers are asking for that service from us as well. So strategically, we're in a different place than we were before. And lastly, we have stress tested that portfolio on a risk basis and looked at our liquidity profile that we're carrying, and looked at sort of the credit requirements in the U.S. marketplace. And we generally feel that it is, therefore, what we do as our core strategy at Citi, and that's why we've moved it over. Obviously, we always have conversations with regulators about everything we do, but this was our decision.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And when you say, corporate customers have been asking you for this, does this mean vendor financing or does it mean incrementally more investment in incremental private label card?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">It's not vendor financing. It really is -- I mean, we launched the Google Wallet as an example. They're a lots of different aspects of -- we think the credit card and the credit basis, which are not going to be necessarily where banks own the last mile. It may turn out that the last mile customer is a customer of somebody else. And that somebody else is our corporate customer, and they would like to have the kind of card service and/or the financing services to help them, of course, on a risk-controlled and a quality-controlled basis that we will be on top of. But that's what I mean by saying that -- I guess, you talked about private label, that is the kind of service we see having much more demand going forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And on RWAs, you assess them the same whether they're in Citicorp or Citi Holdings. Is that right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">There may be some differences in terms of -- depending on the clientele and how it's done. But by and large, we are okay with both risk-weighted assets on both sides, branded and this side. And we're happy with the rates of return we can earn for you on both of those business, and that was part of the decision-making as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. And then lastly on capital ratios. You indicated that 8% to 9% all in common Tier 1 by year-end '12. We've got some conversation coming out of the Europeans that they are looking for their rates to get to 9% sometime in the middle of next year. Does that at all weigh into your thinking into what you're planning for by year-end '12?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I would say, first of all, I don't really know exactly what the regulators are going to do in Europe nor do I necessarily know the measures are built on what. And so it's not clearly one of the biggest issues we've had, which is what we've been arguing for, is a level playing field. Let's get to apples and apples. So I don't know what those numbers are. But our plans are our plans. We're going to get to 8% to 9% of Basel III by the end of next year. And these are the plans we've been talking about for a while, and we think they're the right ones for us and our shareholders.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question comes from Ed Najarian with ISI Group.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Ed Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Just one quick question. I guess when JPMorgan reported earnings, they were much more conservative about loan loss reserve recapture given their outlook. You're still recapturing some reserves, obviously less than in prior quarters but have given a pretty muted outlook obviously especially for the North American mortgage and home equity market, I'm just wondering how you're thinking about reserve recapture and maybe how you're thinking about it in terms of both corp and Holdings going forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I think when you look at where we've been releasing reserves recently, it's primarily been in our 2 U.S. cards portfolios. And don't forget, we were among the last of the institutions to actually begin reserve releases, and because, quite frankly, we were one of the last to actually reprice the portfolio and then see the impact from all of that flow through our books, when you take a look at the 2 branded -- at the 2 portfolios, both branded cards and retail partner cards, which we show you on that slide in the investor deck, we're continuing to see improved performance both on an NCL and a delinquency basis, and we'll be guided by that as we consider reserve actions in the future. I'd say that we are very comfortable with our existing LLR ratio of 5.1%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I don't know what conservative means in any case. Everybody has to be reserved fairly, and we are very cognizant of the environment we are headed into as we've been for a long time when we were one of the only ones that talked about housing prices going down for a long time here. And so we get it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Ed Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So we could potentially see more of that sort of your view now as a good chance that most of that will come from card to the extent that we do see more?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">To the extent that we've got reserve releases in the future, it is most likely to be much more heavily weighted towards those 2 cards portfolios.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Ed Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. And then just a quick follow-up, and I'm guessing this one's going to be a challenge to answer. But you highlight that you want to return capital in 2012. I know you haven't tried to quantify that amount other than saying you want to finish the year at that 8% to 9% level on Basel III Tier 1. But as we think about the trade-off next year on whatever amount of capital you do end up returning between buybacks and dividends. On the one hand, I'm guessing you want to raise the dividend and establish sort of start to the payout ratio or to a better payout ratio. But on the other hand, you might have a very great opportunity to be buying back a fairly significant amount of stock at a big discount to tangible book. So I'm just wondering how you're balancing that trade-off in your head right now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">That's a very valid question for a stock that's trading below tangible book value right now. I mean, by buying back stock, if that's the way we decide the return of capital, we'll be helping our long-term shareholders in 2 ways: one, by reducing stock count; and two, by accreting their book value per share by doing that. That's a very powerful way to create value for your long-term shareholders. And certainly, we're going to take that into account as we think about this. I think that's particularly true as we look beyond 2012, when we look at all the DTA monetization and all that capital that's released by the wind down of Holdings, as we look to that, we'll be very cognizant of where the stock is trading on a price-to-book-value basis and make decisions accordingly. So your point is valid. That point is not lost on us. And when we get closer to making the decisions, we'll have a much more informed perspective.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Your next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Actually, a few things. One is a follow-up to Betsy's question about if European banks need to get to this 9% by mid-next year. I think that's under Basel 2.5, which you guys and the other U.S. banks aren't on. But I don't know if that's a metric that you track internally and care to share with us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">We're focused on Basel I, which is what we report on now and Basel III, which presumably is where the U.S. will go in the future.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay. Then I think the way the calculations work for the 2.5, I mean, your hypothetical ratio would probably be somewhere between the 11.7 under Basel I and then whatever the Basel III is. It's supposed to be higher than the Basel III but less than the 11.7.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I don't know what to say, Matt. The math may work out that way, but we don't have a comment on that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay. Separately, as you think about the long-term debt footprint for the company, there is a lot that you've talked about running off. Is there some sort of target that you would think about long term?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Well, what we've said, Matt, is very specifically that what we intend to do is to allow all the TLGP debt to run off. We don't intend to refinance any portion of that, and we haven't to date. So as the TLGP debt runs off, that's been reducing our levels of long-term debt.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay. And then just lastly on the expenses, which all the extra details are helpful. As we think about kind of a clean run rate of about 3% or 2.8% to be exact, is that a decent run rate to use going forward beyond the fourth quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I'll have more to say about 2012 when we do the earnings release after the end of the fourth quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay. Any early preview though directionally? I mean, it sounds like you're preparing for a tougher revenue environment, which a lot of us think is the right thing to do. So if there's some things that you can't control. But the underlying expense growth, it does seem like you're more and more focused on that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Yes, I'd say that we're -- I mean, I think we see the same operating environment that you do. And so we will be prepared accordingly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Yes. I mean, I think there's no question we believe rates in the U.S. and the developed markets are going to be low for a very long period of time, which is why we've been making sure that the emerging markets businesses are growing in a very credit controlled way. That's the delta, we think, and we've been methodically going after it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay. Actually if I could just squeeze in a last one here. On the deposits, you had very strong growth in U.S. noninterest income, which is obviously the most profitable stuff. Where is that coming from? And the non-U.S. was down, which I don't know if that's FX or what was driving that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Most of the impact on the international deposits, was driven by changes just in the FX rates. And from a domestic point of view, we had a lot of good deposit growth in Transaction Services. And so again, that's a growing part of our business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Your next question comes from Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer &amp; Co.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Christoph M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I wanted to go into your comments that you'd expect mortgage delinquencies to trend back up again. Is that due to some significant degree because of the weaker economic data points that we've been seeing for the last 3, 5 months? Or is it just that the modified loans are hitting the windows where they would re-default even in a stable economic environment?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Chris, it's a combination of both. I'd say right now, it's probably a little bit more heavily weighted to the re-defaults of the modified than it is the economic point. But they both certainly factor into our view of how this might develop out into the future.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Christoph M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay. And then on the trading results and environment, is it safe to say that, like, heavy damage was done during the month of August, but that September and July were -- just maybe slack activity, but that there were positioning losses as credit spreads blew out that may not be there unless that reoccurs?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I would say that August was a particularly volatile month between the U.S. debt ceiling whatever and the ongoing euro. But throughout the quarter, spreads certainly widened, that happened as well in September. So I'd say it was just an all-around difficult quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Your next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Vivek Juneja - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">A couple of questions. Firstly, what was the amount of hedge gains, John, included in your lending line, which run up from $300 million to $500 million roughly?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yes. We never break out the hedge gains specifically, and that's not a number I've really got at my fingertips. Maybe if you call the IR group, they can get it for you. But it's probably something -- I'm going to say something in the order of, like, $0.5 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Vivek Juneja - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay. And then the SAP assets, there weren't any negative amounts despite spreads widening out. Were those offset by hedges? Or was it something else?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">We did have some negative marks. Maybe it doesn't show up quite in the...</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Vivek Juneja - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yes, the net number we obviously can't see it, so that's why, it doesn't matter...</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">There were some ups and downs. Actually, we had in one of the SAP asset breakouts back on Page 41, you get a little bit of flavor, a little bit more detail as to what went on in the various components of the mark-to-market book. And the single biggest contributor was our derivatives positions in the SAP. And that's just we have some hedges on there, which were just swaps from -- swapping out from pay fixed to floating, hedging some other positions we had. So we've got some gains on those.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Vivek Juneja - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay, yes. Well, that's what drove my comment about whether you had some hedge gains. And on that same page, equity assets are down pretty sharply. Any thing in particular going on?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Not that I know, no.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Vivek Juneja - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Because they went down by almost 1/3.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I'm pretty sure we had an asset sale in there for equities, a small asset sale. So we had a sale of some private equity assets, and I just don't have the detail of that with me right now. But that and then there were obviously marks that we took. But that's what really drove that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Vivek Juneja - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And on the topic of sale, did you sell any MSRs this quarter in holdings?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">No, no, no. We had no sale of MSR this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Vivek Juneja - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay. The value of that came down pretty sharply, too.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Yes, with interest rates.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Vivek Juneja - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Retail partner cards, a question for you, Vikram, which is, now that it's back in Citicorp, strategically, will you think about shifting focus and growing it and adding more partners? Or what's the plan on that one?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I think we do plan to manage it as a real core operating businesses, which means that if there are growth opportunities, then we're going to consider them carefully. I think you understand that the -- Vivek, you know this, the nature of the branded card business given Basel III requirements and open lines and the amount of competitiveness in there suggest that while there are opportunities that the private label business is one where there could be some good opportunities, particularly, as I said, customer behavior is moving towards maintaining the credit line availability on the branded cards and using the point-of-sale private label card as a way to finance their incremental large purchases. And that's a point that's not lost on our corporate clients as well. And we'll be just very, very thoughtful about where and how to make those investments. But certainly, the credit availability in the U.S., in aggregate, has come down a lot, which creates opportunity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Vivek Juneja - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And on the same -- similar theme of growth, you've got the European banks that are thinking about divestitures, especially in the U.S., but also outside. What's your appetite for that in terms of using your capital for any of those?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">First of all, it's -- let me step back a little bit. I think the amount and the quality and the prospects of the deleveraging are still uncertain from what I understand. They're much more dollar-based than euro-based. So the question becomes, what are the dollar-based assets, and what do you want to do with them? And the reality for us is, really, we'd rather use our capital towards those businesses and those areas that create a long-term earnings profile versus having a mark-to-market gain on a shorter-term investment. Although if there are opportunities that come up, we'll look at it. But I don't think you should expect us to be a preferred bid for the large amount of assets they may sell.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Your next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I'm trying to remember back to the beginning of the call, I think you had -- you put some metrics out for the quality of the private label book, and from what I recall, a 7.5% loss rate seems kind of high. Do you think that cycle's down to a particular level? And do you have a normalized level? Kind of coupled with that, it was alluded in an earlier question, but there's been a fair amount of portfolios trading hands in that area. Would that be in something in which you would think about actually acquiring portfolios now that this is back in Citicorp? And I've got a follow-up.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Well, I think the base strategy is still one of organically growing with our clients and particularly our corporate clients and the existing private label partner, card partners, that we have in that business. There are occasionally portfolios that come up. We'll take a look at them, and it has to be compelling within wanting to have that portfolio for that quality of credit card clients, that quality of customer and that particular corporate client as well. So we'll look at them, but our driving strategy is going to be to grow organically with where we think credit is necessary.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">And Moshe, to get back to your focus on the NCL rate, as we said earlier, the NCL rate, and which you quoted, it's like 7.5% for this quarter. That was down 166 basis points from the prior quarter, and we think that business kind of operates more in the 6% to 6.5% range over time. So we think we still have some room to run in improvement.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Okay. And just a comment, a separate topic. That Page 20, which I thought was really good disclosure on breaking down your investments a little more. I mean, is the primary driver the revenue generating investments actually delivering or some of the other things getting decreased in terms of what you've laid out in terms of getting to positive operating leverage by kind of division or geography that you have spoken about before?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">We're on track to deliver. I'm not going to say on every single investment. I mean, obviously, you've got a couple that are probably not doing exactly what you wanted to. But overall, our revenue investments, we're seeing results, and I think you're starting to see the results, certainly, as you look at what we're achieving in Asia and in Latin America. The revenue growth we're getting out of GTS, I mean, there's a lot of new client mandates there. So I think we're doing pretty well as far as getting the results that we want out of those investments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">And if you look at the table that John put up, a lot of those investments are against our retail businesses internationally, retail businesses, GTS businesses, all of which are predictable -- more predictable, I should say, in terms of when you invest and what could come out of that. And so we also make sure the investment skew is towards those businesses that we think give us a good rate of return.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">You had mentioned the North American consumer would be kind of later next year. How much of that $1.9 billion is being targeted there? Any sense proportionally?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">I can't give you the exact number off the top of my head, Moshe. We can get that for you as far as rough like...</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">I mean, we're certainly seeing some initiatives just kind of in the media and the like.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Your next question comes from Jason Goldberg with Barclays Capital.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Jason M. Goldberg - Barclays Capital, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">You mentioned a lot of the decline in equities trading was tied to unwinding of principal strategy positions. Can we just talk to where you are in that process, how much more to go? And are those kind of realized or unrealized losses we saw?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Yes, Jason. I'd say we're close to 2/3 done winding down that particular position, that business. So that's kind of where we are.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Jason M. Goldberg - Barclays Capital, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Okay. And then secondly, I guess, CVA caused a lot variability in the quarter. I know you kind of give us the numbers to back it out. But how should we just think about that going forward? Is it simply -- as spreads come back in, that will go from a gain to a loss? Or are there ways do you kind of manage that, plot that in or is that not something you're really focused on?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Well, we focus on it a lot. But there's little -- when it comes to your bond spreads, I can't hedge that, so I can't hedge my own spreads. So as the spreads widen, you get this ridiculous thing where we book revenue on our fair value option debt. And then as our expense -- as our spreads contract, we'll end up taking revenue off the table.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Your next question comes from Ron Mandle with GIC.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Ron Mandle - GIC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">I have 2 questions. On the capital ratio question before, John, you gave a good rundown of the denominator, but I was wondering about the numerator. And it would have -- it seemed that the amount of the actual dollar amount of Tier 1 common didn't grow during the quarter. I was wondering if you could comment on that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Well, again, the absolute dollar amount of capital is going to be impacted by the FX impact on the capital. Like I said, what we do, Ron, is we hedge the ratio. We don't hedge the nominal dollar value of the capital.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Ron Mandle - GIC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Okay. So you hedge the ratio, so you hedge the denominator, which you spoke about.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">We hedged...</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Ron Mandle - GIC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">And then so you also hedged the numerator, and so that was -- with the denominator. So that was a negative also? If the denominator didn't go down as much as it should have, then the numerator didn't either?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">If we hadn't have grown the $20 billion in risk-weighted assets on the x FX basis, then our risk-weighted assets would have been about $20 billion lower and our Tier 1 ratio would have been about 24 basis points higher than it otherwise would have.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Ron Mandle - GIC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">And in terms of the capital line, that shows up in the AOCI that you referred to before?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Ron Mandle - GIC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Okay. And so if FX is stable in the fourth quarter, then what should we expect? Would there be a reversal of these items?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Well, if it's stable, then nothing would change. So then, you would have no impact on either your nominal value of Tier 1 capital or your Tier 1 ratio. And it would just change based upon all your normal factors.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Ron Mandle - GIC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Okay. And then related to that, in the second quarter slide deck, you had the table that showed how you were leveraging the net income with DTA utilization and the 10% to 15% threshold impact. So presumably there was no benefit of that this quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">We actually utilized about $200 million of the DTA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Ron Mandle - GIC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Okay. And also, on the CVA, you divided it into 2 pieces. You said you had a gain on derivatives. Is that on the -- with your spreads widening, the counterparty spread is also widening, but you actually had it so well hedged, you had a gain?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">That's correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Ron Mandle - GIC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Nice work. And then one last question on a separate topic. When you were talking about the international retail, International Consumer Banking, you said that some of the growth was partially offset by spread compression on a year-on-year basis, but you added that the spread compression seems to be abating. I was wondering if you could expand on that and what that might mean for your net interest margin going forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Well, that's kind of factored into some of the -- it was an earlier question, I can't remember if it was Glenn or whomever had asked about it or John who asked about NIM, and that factors into there, Ron. We are continuing to obviously grow loans in Asia. We still see those loans coming on at lower rates than they had been growing in the past. But now we've been living in a low interest rate environment for the better part of a year, and so you're starting to lap that effect. And so the real downward pressure from that low interest rate environment on your growth is starting to abate. And over time, as you learn to live in a low interest rate environment, it kind of -- it leaves you where you are. I think what we all would like to see is an environment where we've got some increases in interest rates, and that will help to grow our revenues, we think, at a faster rate.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Ron Mandle - GIC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">But it sounds in a way like what you're saying that the pressure in the U.S. will be offset to some extent by the abating of the pressure internationally.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Well, the abating comment that I made earlier, I think, was really on the international portfolio. And so as we look at our regional businesses, there we see an abating effect of a low interest rate environment. Given how the U.S. rates have come down rather dramatically just over the last several months, I don't think that I would use the abate word in relation to U.S. interest rates as yet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Ron Mandle - GIC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">And then I was just saying that the combination -- what you're saying about the combination helps to offset to some extent the U.S. pressure?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Yes. Our international growth certainly helps to offset the impact of a low rate environment in the U.S.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Your next question comes from Todd Hagerman with Sterne Agee.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee &amp; Leach Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">A couple of questions. First, just off in terms of capital. Vikram, you've been pretty confident in terms of your outlook on the capital redeployment, commenting about planning to return a fair amount of capital to shareholders in the next couple of years. But yet, in the course of the call today, we've talked about some of the volatility within your Tier 1 common ratio. You had less DTA utilization this quarter than, I think, you had the last couple of quarters. Could you just talk, first, just in terms of your conviction on that outlook and kind of, again, what gives you that confidence in terms of returning that shareholders in face of some your peers being a little bit more cautious, particularly as they think about the uncertainty with B3?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">We've been uncertain about B3 for a while. This was -- we were very early on in talking about. It makes no sense to talk about where you are or what the calibration is because those details were still being done. And so we've been very cautious of giving you guidance that we believed in on where we're going. So maybe there are others who see the same caution that we saw earlier, and that's fine. The path that we have put ourselves on takes into account the kind of performance we've had this quarter, the last quarter and what we expect to be our continuing performance over the next few quarters as well. We also are incorporating the fact that we'll get some more clarity on some of the calibration that's out there, still uncertain on B3. But given all of that, we are still of the view that we will be at 8% to 9% on Basel III by the end of next year. And we're still of the point of view that we ought to be able to start returning capital, subject to regulatory approval, next year. There are others who started this year, and we were also very cautious of making sure that we paced ourselves as far as that was concerned, when we were asked why not do it this year. And I think, again, that was also part of the same sort of longer-term planning. So what I would say to you is that the Basel III set of rules and calibrations are, not without doubt, they're not clear yet. But taking all of that into account, we're still of the point of view we're going to hit our Basel III numbers by the end of next year, and we're still of the point of view we can do that, as well as return capital next year. And those are the conversations we've been having with our regulators.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee &amp; Leach Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Okay. And if I could tie in just in terms of your outlook on holdings. I think, again, you referenced to the notion that you may or expect to be below kind of a 10% threshold. And I think you characterized it in the near term, if you will. How should we think about the relative mortgage exposure within holdings, your cautious outlook there? You did sell a small amount of credit this quarter. But again, I think in quarters past, you talked about a slower runoff as it relates to holdings. And now it seems that perhaps your -- the outlook has changed in terms of the contribution, the relative size. How should we think about that going forward and your comments on mortgage and partner cards specifically?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Yes. Our prior perspective still stand in terms of what we mentioned to you and where we are. You know the schedule. We've got, today, a Local Consumer Lending book of $217 billion. That includes, by the way, the partner cards, $44 billion approximately at the end of the third quarter. And you know where we are with the Brokerage and Asset Management, especially the JV with Morgan Stanley. You know we're with our SAP pool of $45 billion or so. I think the way to think about this is consistent with what we said earlier. There are possibilities of sales in this portfolio that continue, particularly those that we think will reduce our severity risk. We'll continue to examine those. But certain portfolios like mortgages are going to have to mature over time. So none of that perspective really has changed, except that if you move over the partner card business, we're approximately about $250 billion on a pro forma basis, and all I said earlier was that we believe we are on track to get below 10% in due course of time, and that's a good number to have, the Citi Holdings to be below 10% of our total assets. By the way, everybody has some of these, if not most of these assets. We just have -- call them Citi Holdings. Others have them in their core portfolios. And to have this number be less than 10% tells you a little bit about how de-risked we are as a business, and that's why that goal is important to us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">But we're going to continue to approach everything in Citi Holdings from an economically rational fashion. We're not going to rush just to get down to below 10%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee &amp; Leach Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">I can appreciate that, John. Just, again, the concern being the relative mortgage exposure, your cautious comments there and whether or not...</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">From a relative mortgage exposure, I kind of like our position.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">I want to be very clear. I don't think John was talking about something specific to us. We're talking about macro issues out here. Okay? These are issues having to do with joblessness out there, having to do with the fact that unemployment is not ticking down. And so these are macro issues surrounding mortgages. In that kind of environment, you'd rather have this portfolio than many others.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Your next question comes from Mike Mayo with CLSA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Yes, my first question is on the movement of the retail partner cards business from Citi Holdings to Citicorp, and you said in the press release that it's due to current credit trends, at least that's one of the reasons. Yet, isn't the movement -- isn't Citicorp more about strategic placement as opposed to current happenings?</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Yes. I mean, we wouldn't have moved it unless we went through, Mike, a very thoughtful, strategic view as to what was happening to credit in the U.S. and the customer base in the U.S. and what's happening to funding and all of that. And the fact is that there is a closer relation between the private label card business and customers being able to get credit today than prior to the CARD Act being passed and prior to Basel III rules. And so it was on the basis of all of that. We also see a trend, by the way, where it's going to be quite likely that not all banks are going to be able to own the last mile in terms of the customer. And therefore, having these capabilities to serve our corporate clients customers are an important part of the services we have to offer them as well. So it was in relation to that. It was in relation to the fact that we're going to manage that portfolio as tightly as we are managing today in terms of making sure it's high credit quality. And so this was not based on any one quarter or any one month in terms of assessment. It was based on what we think it means to us longer term, and what it's going to contribute to our earnings base, for you, on a long-term basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">I've got a second question. Asia has had some noise recently in terms of growth expectations. And your Asian consumer loans, the average loans, grew 17% year-over-year. Are you thinking about potentially slowing the pace of growth or being more cautious?</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">We do not target a growth rate. We target a clientele that we believe we can help and a lot depends upon what our clients need. And that, too, our clientele in some of these markets is different than some of the local banks might have or who much more penetration. They are much more mass-market than we are. So there are a couple of factors that are going to drive our loan growth. One is obviously the absolute growth rate in these economies, they will have an impact. But the second part is, that our bank in these countries serves a kind of clientele, which is still growing, and we are still underpenetrated in terms of serving some of these clients that we may have a structural growth rate that may turn out to be different than the broader GDP growth rate of other countries. That's what's going to drive our growth. But it is not driven by saying we need to make an x amount of target in terms of loan growth. It's based on serving our clients and the credit quality we're comfortable with.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">And Mike, don't forget the numbers that you're looking at, obviously, the as-reported, if you go to the back of the investor deck, we've given you all of the drivers on a constant-dollar basis. And if you go to Page 43 of the investor deck, you'll see that on a constant dollar basis, our loan growth in Asia is much lower than that 17% that you're quoting. On a constant-dollar basis, our card loans grow about -- this is end of period loans. They grew by about 5%, and the retail banking loans are growing about 12%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">And then my last question is on expenses. I know you've touched on that a lot. Slide 19 breaks out your expenses pretty clearly, saying it's up $2 billion or so on a core basis. And I guess your revenues on a core basis year-to-date might be down $3 billion to $4 billion, just taking the managed revenues on Slide 5, down $2 billion and Slide 45, the FX impact that helped you by $1.4 billion. So core revenues year-to-date, down $3.5 billion; core expenses, up $2 billion year-to-date, so $5.5 billion gap. And as you highlighted on Slide 20, maybe half of that is due to investment spending. What's the reason for the rest of that gap between core revenue and core expense growth?</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">Mike, as we said, we are investing in the businesses. And I think we've given you a path towards where we get most of the businesses to positive operating leverage. When you're in an investment mode, you're going to have things like that, and obviously, the biggest variability is in the Securities and Banking business. And as Vikram said earlier, that's one where I think the entire market now is still searching to see what the new secular normal is. But if you think about all of our other businesses, we've got Asia now. Asia RCB is a positive operating leverage, so revenue growth in; excess of expense growth, and that's the way we'll continue to operate that business. Latin America hits in the fourth quarter. We'll hit GTS on that basis either the second or the third quarter of next year and then North America Regional Consumer Banking towards the end of next year. So we're investing to grow revenues, and we're going to be delivering that revenue growth over the course of the next year or so.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">And the revenues have been obviously impacted by the carry-on impact of the CARD Act, as well as FDIC assessments, things of that sort. So there are lots of items that affected the revenue line. But the most important thing to us is these investments are occurring, as John Gerspach said, against those opportunities that we think create good earnings for our shareholders on a long-term basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">Your next question comes from Mike Holton with Boston Company.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Michael Holton - Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">Two quick ones. On your PIIGS exposure, what was the net P&amp;L impact this quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">I'm sorry, I can't answer that. I just don't know.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Michael Holton - Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">Okay. I mean, given spreads blew out, it would seem like given your hedges on it, it probably was a positive. But that's a guess and I'm...</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">Sorry.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Michael Holton - Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">Okay and then just a second thing, you guys made a lot about -- a lot of statements and I think you properly hedged yourself by saying, \"Hey, assuming the economy does not deteriorate from kind of current levels.\" Just to get a sense for kind of the economic indicators you're using in your head, are you kind of assuming U.S. growing 2% plus or minus GDP and Europe kind of bounces along the bottom?</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">That would be pretty fair. That would be pretty fair.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">Your next question comes from Adam Hurwich with Ulysses Management.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Adam G. Hurwich - Ulysses Management LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">A question regarding the credit card business. Given your macroeconomic outlook and given how you've managed lines of credit in the credit card business both in the U.S. and abroad, could you see maximum losses in your scenario not reaching where losses were prior to the card cycle?</p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">You were breaking up a little bit as you were speaking. And so I'm not quite sure I caught the gist of it. It was something about national loss rates?</p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"><strong>Adam G. Hurwich - Ulysses Management LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">No. Given the way you've managed the lines of credit in the credit card business, both in the U.S. and abroad, could you see loss rates in those businesses not reaching prior peaks?</p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">The answer is yes, absolutely.</p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"><strong>Adam G. Hurwich - Ulysses Management LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">And can you give us just a sense as to how much you think you can undercut those previous peaks?</p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">Well, if you take a look at Asia. I think we've said Asia in the past, has, over the last 10 years, sort of average loss rates of 3% to 4%. We could be in the 2s, longer term. Maybe so just kind of a shade below that. And I don't want to give you a view on the U.S. just as yet, but as I've said, we think that we're certainly trending down in both portfolios. But it's a little early to give you an absolute where I think that will end up.</p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">There are no additional questions at this time. Are there any closing remarks?</p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"><strong>John Andrews</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">This is John Andrews, again, Investor Relations. Thank you for letting us bring this in under slightly 2 hours. Hope you have a good afternoon. If you have any follow-up questions, you know where to find us.

Today's call will be hosted by John Andrews, Head of Citi Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions] Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Mr. Andrews, you may begin.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>John Andrews</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Rachel, thank you. Good morning, and thank you everyone for joining us this morning. On our call today, Vikram Pandit, our CFO -- CEO, I'm sorry, will speak first; and John Gerspach, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we will be happy to take your questions. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results and capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2010 Form 10-K. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">With that out of the way, let me turn it over to Vikram.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">John, thank you, and good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us today. As you know, earlier today, we reported earnings of $1.2 billion in net income for the fourth quarter of 2011. This increased our net income for the year to $11.3 billion, up 6% from 2010. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">The fourth quarter was dominated by the macro environment, and our earnings clearly suffered as a result. Market activity was down significantly and our clients reduced their risk. Any of our businesses geared to the capital markets, such as sales and trading, Securities and Fund Services and GTS and even investment sales and consumer banking were impacted. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Investor activity was particularly weak in December as reflected in the volumes we experienced. In light of the macro environment, we have been quite cautious. The situation in Europe is being driven by politics as much as anything else. And given its inherent unpredictability, we have prudently derisked and hedged our exposures, actions which have further impacted our revenues. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">However, our consumer and nonmarkets-related businesses continue to perform well as we executed our strategy. Throughout Citicorp, we grew our loans by 14% from 2010, including a 24% increase in corporate loans. And GTS continued to show positive momentum with the full year revenue of 5% from 2010. Revenue from International Consumer Banking grew by 6%, x FX for the year as we opened 3 million new accounts while increasing average loans and deposits on a constant dollar basis by $15 billion and $9 billion, respectively. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">During the quarter, we achieved positive operating leverage in Latin America and again in Asia during the quarter. In the U.S., customer accounts, deposits, loans and revenue each grew from the previous quarter. We continue to make progress in winding down Citi Holdings. We reduced Holdings' assets by $90 billion during the year. And after considering the impact of the transfer of Retail Partner Cards into Citicorp, Holdings comprised only 12% of Citigroup's balance sheet. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">And as I indicated in December, we took a $400 million severance charge in the fourth quarter due to the reduction of approximately 5,000 positions. There were also other macro and episodic charges that John will go over in his presentation, including FX, a Japan DTA write-down and increased legal and related expenses. We also didn't have the CVA/DVA benefit, which had substantially increased our revenue in the third quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">As we know, the situation in Europe is having a global impact. We believe it will impact U.S. GDB -- GDP by somewhere within 0.5% to 1.5%, and the emerging markets are being affected as well. The European banks have $40 trillion in total assets and they are deleveraging as a result. And from what we understand, these banks hold 65% of an emerging market debt and finance 80% of global trade finance. So the global banking system will need to step up and fill the void that comes from the deleveraging. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">As usual, the future isn't easy to predict, but we believe we are prepared. Despite the improved tone of the market so far this month and the positive signs coming from Europe, we will continue to maintain a cautious posture until the political aspects of the current situation are clear. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In 2011, our expenses were impacted by several factors. Most significantly, a weakened dollar added $800 million in FX, while legal and related expenses were $1.3 billion higher than in 2010. These drove an increase in total expenses of just under 7%. But as you will see, our core operating expenses rose by 2.1%. This includes $3.9 billion in investments, $1.9 billion of which were funded through our ongoing expense reduction initiatives. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">The $3.9 billion in investments included approximately $1 billion to meet regulatory requirements. We also upgraded talent in both our institutional and consumer businesses. Other investments from modernizing our branches to increased marketing are necessary to attract and serve our clients better. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">A few years ago, the company had substantially reduced its spending on consumer marketing. And in 2011, we increased that spending to competitive levels. These are longer-cycle investments, but they are starting to pay off through increases in our new account acquisitions in the U.S. and the attaining of positive operating leverage in key EM consumer markets. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">That being said, I believe these increases in expense levels are behind us. We have a robust reengineering program and our goal is to self-fund new investments going forward. As a result of this and other actions, we currently expect to reduce our expenses by $2.5 billion to $3 billion in 2012 compared to the reported full year 2011 level, of course, excluding changes in FX or unanticipated legal costs or significant one-timers. We also continue to right-size our business for the opportunities we see, particularly in Securities and Banking. So we're prepared whether the current environment proves to be a result of cyclical or secular trends. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">John will now go over the slides, and I'll come back later with him and would be happy to take your questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Thank you, Vikram, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 2, on a full year basis, Citigroup reported revenues of $78.4 billion in 2011. Operating expenses were $50.7 billion and credit costs were $12.8 billion, down over 50% from the prior year. Pretax income for 2011 was nearly $15 billion and net income was $11.3 billion or $3.69 per share. We earned $14.4 billion of net income in Citicorp, with earnings in Asia and Latin America contributing roughly half of the total. And we significantly narrowed the net loss in Citi Holdings to $2.4 billion from $4.3 billion in the prior year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Before I go into more detail, I'd like to spend a minute on significant items affecting the fourth quarter and comparable periods as shown on Slide 3. In addition to the difficult macro environment and our corresponding actions which Vikram described earlier, Citigroup's results reflect a number of firm-specific items, several of which we previewed for you in early December. First, revenue comparisons are significantly skewed by credit spread-related items. Citigroup's CVA and DVA were a negative $40 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to a positive $1.9 billion last quarter and a negative $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter of last year. Also, in our lending business in Securities and Banking, we recorded hedge losses of nearly $300 million this quarter, driven by spread tightening in our lending portfolio compared to hedge gains of nearly $650 million last quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Second, we recorded significantly higher legal and related expenses, as well as repositioning charges in the fourth quarter of 2011. Legal and related expenses were over $550 million in the fourth quarter, including an increase in reserves related to interchange litigation. Severance charges were over $400 million in the fourth quarter, more than double the amount of repositioning expenses in prior periods. Finally, this quarter, we recorded a $300 million charge to write-down the value of deferred tax assets in Japan as the result of a tax rate change. In addition to these items, our reported results were affected by foreign exchange translation. As the U.S. dollar generally strengthened in the fourth quarter against local currencies in which we generate revenues and incur expenses and credit costs. While FX translation had no material impact on our overall earnings for the quarter, it did affect individual line items and reported business drivers, which I will discuss more as we go through the presentation. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On Slide 4, we show fourth quarter results. Citigroup reported fourth quarter net income of $1.2 billion or $0.38 per diluted share. Revenues of $17.2 billion were down 7% versus the prior year on a reported basis as growth in International Consumer Banking and Transaction Services was more than offset by lower revenues in Citi Holdings, Securities and Banking and North America Consumer Banking. Expenses of $12.9 billion were up 4% year-over-year. Nearly 2/3 of the increase was attributable to the combination of higher legal and related costs, as well as severance, partially offset by a positive impact from foreign exchange translation. Excluding these items, expenses were up 1.5% over last year, principally due to higher investment spending, partially offset by productivity savings and other expense reductions. Cost of credit continued to improve year-over-year, down 41% to $2.9 billion. Year-over-year, Citigroup end of period loans were flat on a reported basis and up 1%, excluding the impact of FX, as continued loan growth in Citicorp outpaced the wind-down of Citi Holdings. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning now to Citicorp and Citi Holdings on Slide 5. Citicorp reported revenues of $14 billion and net income of $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter. Versus last year, Citicorp loans grew 14% on a reported basis, including 7% growth in consumer and 24% growth in corporate loans. We grew loans in every business in Citicorp in the fourth quarter both year-over-year and sequentially. Citi Holdings reported revenues of $2.8 billion and a net loss of $806 million. Citi Holdings ended the year with $269 billion of assets, down $20 billion during the quarter and $90 billion year-over-year. Adjusting for the first quarter transfer of Retail Partner Cards into Citicorp, Citi Holdings would have ended the year with $225 billion of assets or 12% of total Citigroup assets. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On Slide 6, we show a 9-quarter trend for Citicorp's results. Excluding CVA/DVA, Citicorp's revenues of $14.1 billion in the fourth quarter were down 8% from the prior year and down 11% from the prior quarter, driven by lower revenues in Securities and Banking. As I discussed earlier, Securities and Banking results reflect nearly $300 million of hedge losses in our lending business in the fourth quarter compared to hedge gains of nearly $650 million last quarter. Excluding these hedge gains and losses, Citicorp revenues x CVA/DVA were down 5% sequentially. Operating expenses of $10.2 billion were up 8% versus the prior year. Nearly half of the increase was attributable to the combination of higher legal and related costs, as well as severance, partially offset by a positive impact from foreign exchange translation. Excluding these items, expenses were up 4% over last year, primarily driven by higher investment spending, mostly in consumer banking and operations and technology, partially offset by productivity savings and other expense reductions. Citicorp's net credit losses were $1.9 billion, down 29% from the prior year, driven by Citi-branded cards in North America. We released $699 million in net loan loss reserves, down from $741 million last year as higher net releases in Citi-branded cards were more than offset by lower releases in the corporate portfolio and a small net build in International Consumer Banking. Excluding CVA/DVA, earnings before taxes of $2.7 billion were down 31% versus last year, driven by lower revenues as higher operating costs were largely offset by the lower cost of credit. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Slide 7 shows the results for North America Consumer Banking. Revenues of $3.5 billion were down 2% versus last year, driven by card revenues, reflecting the continued impact of the look-back provisions of CARD Act and a decline in average card loans, partially offset by an increase in mortgage revenues. Expenses of $2.1 billion were up 31% year-over-year and 13% sequentially, driven in part by an increase in legal reserves related to interchange litigation. Excluding this reserve increase, expenses were up modestly versus last quarter as we continue to make investments in our North America consumer franchise. Credit costs declined 74% from last year to $372 million. Net credit losses were down 41% to $1 billion, driven by Citi-branded cards, and the net reserve release was $681 million this quarter compared to $348 million in the prior year. Earnings before tax, excluding the impact of loan loss reserves, grew by 82% year-over-year to $386 million in the fourth quarter. Overall, we continue to see signs of progress in our North America consumer business. Sequentially, for the third consecutive quarter, we grew our total revenues, card accounts and end of period card loans. Purchase sales grew 2% year-over-year and card accounts were up 4%. Average deposits were up 2% year-over-year and retail loans were up over 25%. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to our International Consumer Banking businesses on Slide 8. First, as Vikram mentioned, both Asia and Latin America achieved positive operating leverage in the fourth quarter. In total, International Consumer Banking revenues grew 2% versus last year, while expenses remained flat. The dollar generally appreciated in the fourth quarter, resulting in a negative impact on reported revenues. On a constant dollar basis, revenues grew 6% year-over-year and 2% from the third quarter, with sequential growth in both Asia and Latin America. Overall, revenue growth continued to reflect improvement in most underlying drivers, offset by spread compression. Accounts grew 4% year-over-year. And on a constant dollar basis, we grew average deposits, average loans and purchase sales in every region in the fourth quarter, both sequentially and year-over-year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Investment sales were lower, however, reflecting weaker investor sentiment in the face of a continued challenging macroeconomic environment in the fourth quarter. Expenses of $2.9 billion in the fourth quarter were roughly flat versus last year, including a benefit from FX translation, partially offset by higher severance charges. Excluding these items, expenses were up roughly 3% over last year as we are now beginning to lap our higher levels of investment spending in Asia and Latin America in the second half of 2010. Credit costs were $787 million in the fourth quarter as compared to $593 million last year. While net credit losses declined 10% to $683 million, we recorded a small net reserve build of $72 million in the fourth quarter, principally due to portfolio growth versus a net release in the prior year. We continued to grow our international consumer loans in a disciplined manner, as we discussed in more detail on last quarter's call. We believe the underlying credit quality of the portfolio has remained stable to improving. Earnings before tax, excluding the impact of loan loss reserves, grew 19% year-over-year to $1.1 billion. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">And on Slide 9, we show growth trends for International Consumer Banking in more detail. On a constant dollar basis, average loans grew 13% over the prior year. Average deposits were up 6% and purchase sales grew 11% in the fourth quarter. As reported, on a trailing 12-month basis, we have grown both net credit margin and pretax earnings, excluding the impact of loan loss reserves, each quarter for over 2 years. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Slide 10 shows our Securities and Banking business. As I mentioned earlier, revenue comparisons for Securities and Banking in the fourth quarter are difficult, given the swings in CVA and DVA and the $939 million sequential change in hedge results in our lending business. Excluding only CVA/DVA, revenues of $3.3 billion were down by nearly 1/3 on both a year-over-year and a sequential basis. If we also exclude the sequential impact of lending hedges, revenues were down by 15% from the third quarter, with particular weakness in the last 3 weeks of December. In Investment Banking, revenues of $638 million were down 13% sequentially, driven by lower activity levels across all products. x CVA/DVA, Equity Market revenues of $32 million were down 20% sequentially, driven by a decline in market volumes globally, which resulted in lower cash equity revenues. This was partially offset by narrowing losses in proprietary trading where the wind-down is now complete. We also continue to experience weak trading results in our equity derivatives business. Fixed Income Market revenues, x CVA/DVA were down 24% sequentially to $1.7 billion. We continue to experience pressure in credit and securitized products in the fourth quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">In rates and currencies, G10 products also declined from a strong third quarter, although this was partially offset by growth in emerging markets products. Lending revenues was $164 million, down from $1 billion last quarter, driven by the sequential change in hedge results I discussed earlier. Private Bank revenues, excluding CVA/DVA, were down 5% sequentially to $517 million, mainly driven by lower capital markets activity. Total operating expenses of $3.7 billion were up 2% from last year and 4% sequentially, driven mainly by severance charges. Absent severance, expenses would have been down 4% versus last year, driven by lower incentive compensation and a positive impact from FX. And sequentially, expenses would have been roughly flat. Credit costs were $69 million in the fourth quarter versus a benefit of $60 million last year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Moving to Transaction Services on Slide 11. Revenues of $2.6 billion were up 2% from the fourth quarter of last year as strong growth in Treasury and Trade Solutions more than offset a decline in Securities and Fund Services. Treasury and Trade Solutions was up 7%, primarily due to higher trade revenues and increased deposits, partially offset by the continued -- by the impact of the continued low rate environment and FX. Securities and Fund Services was down 10% year-over-year, driven by lower settlement volumes, spread compression and the impact of FX. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">While lower Securities and Fund Services revenues reflected the overall capital markets environment, most underlying drivers for Transaction Services continued to show momentum. Average trade loans were up over 50% from last year. Average deposits were up 4%. And on a constant dollar basis, assets under custody were also up year-over-year, with good inflows in our custody assets. Expenses of $1.5 billion were up 14% versus last year, mainly due to investment spending, as well as severance and higher legal and related costs. Sequentially, the 4% expense increase was primarily due to severance and higher legal and related costs as our level of investment spending is beginning to flatten quarter-over-quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On Slide 12, we show a 9-quarter trend for Citi Holdings. The loss in Citi Holdings was $806 million in the fourth quarter, flat with the prior quarter and down from a loss of over $1 billion last year. Revenues were down 30% year-over-year to $2.8 billion due primarily to lower assets. Operating expenses of $2.2 billion were down 8% versus last year. Total credit costs were down 43% to $1.6 billion. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Looking at Citi Holdings in more detail on Slide 13. Revenues in Brokerage and Asset Management were $43 million this quarter, down from last year due to a lower contribution from the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney joint venture. In Local Consumer Lending, revenues were down 13% versus last year to $3 billion, driven by declining loan balances. In the Special Asset Pool, revenues were negative $234 million in the fourth quarter. Net interest revenue was negative $94 million as interest-earning assets continue to represent a smaller portion of the Special Asset Pool, while we continue to incur funding costs on the total portfolio. Noninterest revenue was negative $140 million, driven by realized net losses and other marks during the quarter as compared to net gains in the prior year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Operating expenses were down 8% year-over-year to $2.2 billion, mainly due to declining assets, partially offset by higher legal and related costs. Sequentially, expenses were up 4% due to higher legal and related costs, driven by the mortgage business, as well as an increase in interchange litigation reserves. Credit costs were down 43% year-over-year to $1.6 billion, as credit trends continued to improve in both the consumer and corporate portfolios. Total net credit losses were down 47% to $2.2 billion, and we released $767 million of net loan loss reserves in Citi Holdings. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Slide 14 shows Citi Holdings' assets. We ended the quarter with $269 billion in Citi Holdings or 14% of total Citigroup assets. The $20 billion reduction in the fourth quarter was comprised of nearly $12 billion of asset sales and business dispositions, approximately $7 billion of net runoff and pay downs and nearly $2 billion of net cost of credit and net asset marks. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Slide 15 shows the results for the Corporate/Other segment. Revenues of $384 million were up significantly from last year, mainly driven by hedging activities partially offset by lower investment yields and lower gains on sales of AFS securities. Expenses were down by $82 million versus last year, mainly due to lower legal and related expenses. Assets of $286 billion included approximately $95 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $130 billion of liquid available-for-sale securities. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Turning to total Citigroup expenses on Slide 16. For full year 2011, expenses totaled $50.7 billion, up nearly 7% from $47.4 billion in 2010. In both 2010 and 2011, expenses included episodic legal and related costs, as well as repositioning charges. In order to better compare the core operating expense growth year-over-year, we have isolated these items, as well as the impact of foreign exchange. In 2010, expenses of $47.4 billion included approximately $700 million of episodic legal and related costs and roughly $500 million of repositioning charges, and the year-over-year impact of foreign exchange was roughly $800 million. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Adjusting for these items, core operating costs on a constant dollar basis were roughly $47 billion in 2010. In 2011, investment spending was roughly $3.9 billion higher for the full year, and we funded nearly half of these investments with efficiency savings of $1.9 billion. All other variances in core operating costs, including higher volume-related expenses in Citicorp, were more than offset by lower costs in Citi Holdings. Therefore, on a constant dollar basis, core operating expenses of $48 billion in 2011 were approximately $1 billion or just over 2% higher versus the prior year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">In 2011, episodic legal and related costs were roughly $2 billion and repositioning charges were around $700 million, bringing total expenses up to $50.7 billion. While some level of episodic expenses will likely continue in 2012, we remain highly focused on managing our core operating expense trends. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Slide 17 shows total Citigroup net credit losses and loan loss reserves. NCLs continued to improve in the fourth quarter, down 9% sequentially to $4.1 billion, and the net LLR release was $1.5 billion, up slightly from the third quarter. We ended the quarter with $30.1 billion of total loan loss reserves and our LLR ratio was 4.7%. Consumer NCLs declined 7% sequentially to $4 billion, and we released $1.2 billion in net loan loss reserves. Corporate credit was a benefit of $158 million in the fourth quarter compared to a cost of $86 million last quarter on lower net credit losses and a higher reserve release. Total nonaccrual loans represented 1.7% of total loans at year end, down from nearly 3% at the end of 2010. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Slide 18 shows our international consumer credit trends, which generally remained stable to improving in Citicorp in the fourth quarter as loans continued to grow. In Asia, the NCL rate remained stable in the 1% range in the fourth quarter, and 90-plus day delinquencies were lower than last quarter. In Latin America, the sequential NCL rate increase reflects the impact of adjustments, primarily in cards to conform loss recognition procedures in Central America. Excluding these adjustments, the NCL rate would have been stable in the fourth quarter and delinquency rates continued to improve. In Local Consumer Lending in Citi Holdings, the sequential decline in loans and the uptick in delinquencies in the fourth quarter mainly reflect the announced sale of our retail banking business in Belgium as these loans were moved into other assets held for sale. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">On Slide 19, we show our North America card portfolios. In Citi-branded cards, the NCL rate continued to improve in the fourth quarter, down 63 basis points sequentially to 5.3%, and 90-plus day delinquencies were down to 1.3%. In Retail Partner Cards, the NCL rate improved to 7.3% this quarter, and 90-plus day delinquencies remained stable. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">On Slide 20, we show the North America mortgage portfolio in Citi Holdings, split between residential first mortgages and home equity loans. NCLs improved in both portfolios in the fourth quarter, although as we have previously discussed, the pace continued to moderate. In residential first mortgages, we ended the quarter with nearly $68 billion of loans, down 16% from 1 year ago. Net credit losses were down 6% sequentially to $412 million. As we discussed last quarter, overall delinquency trends are beginning to show the impact of re-defaults of previously modified mortgages. While, at the same time, the pace of asset sales and modifications has slowed. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Sales of delinquent mortgages, for example, declined to nearly $300 million in the fourth quarter from roughly $500 million in the prior quarter. These converging trends drove an increase in 90-plus day delinquencies in the fourth quarter, up $260 million to $4.1 billion. Early-stage delinquencies in this portfolio, however, actually improved quarter-over-quarter. Importantly, re-default rates for HAMP and other modifications continued to track favorably versus expectations through the fourth quarter, with expectations for re-defaults and a resulting increase in net credit losses already factored into our net loan loss reserve balance. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">In home equity loans, we ended the quarter with $40 billion of loans, down 12% from a year ago. Net credit losses were down 2% sequentially to $533 million in the fourth quarter. 90-plus day delinquencies were flat versus the prior quarter at $1 billion, while early-stage delinquencies improved. Overall, the pace of improvement in our home equity NCLs and delinquencies has slowed, and we are watching these trends closely. We continue to allocate roughly $10 billion of our total loan loss reserves to North America real estate lending in Citi Holdings or 31 months of coincident NCL coverage. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Now let me close with some comments about 2012. Clearly, the operating environment continues to be extraordinarily challenging in a number of businesses, none more so than Securities and Banking. While we have seen some pickup in activity in the first weeks of January, the macro uncertainty that has dominated the securities market still remains unresolved. And that largely reflects the ongoing overhang of the Eurozone crisis. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">As Vikram noted, we reduced our risk in the fourth quarter and we saw both institutional and retail clients do likewise, which contributed to meaningfully lower levels of activity across markets and regions. While we firmly believe that Europe has the financial wherewithal to solve the sovereign crisis, any resolution will be a political process, which continues to be uncertain and unpredictable. So until the markets believe that an achievable, comprehensive resolution to the European sovereign debt crisis has been structured, the macro uncertainty that has dominated investor activity will likely remain an issue. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Now the challenges in Europe are not all bad news for us. The significant deleveraging of the European banks is creating meaningful competitive opportunities in a number of businesses, particularly in Transaction Services, as European banks are pulling back from serving many clients in key businesses they historically dominate, like trade finance. And we are pursuing those opportunities, but doing so in a cautious manner as we continue to support our clients while maintaining a tight risk profile. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Given the ongoing headwinds in Securities and Banking, we remain very focused on expenses and, as Vikram mentioned, also on ensuring our capacity is aligned with the opportunities that we see. For 2012, we currently expect Citigroup's full year operating expenses, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and any significant episodic items, will be between $2.5 billion and $3 billion lower than the reported 2011 expenses of $50.7 billion. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Turning to our other businesses. In Transaction Services, we expect revenues to continue to grow at a moderate pace despite the low interest rate environment, and we are reaffirming our expectation that Transaction Services will achieve positive operating leverage by the second or third quarter of this year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">In North America Consumer Banking, we expect consumer credit to continue improving but at a slowing pace in 2012. We are seeing positive trends in this business as we have completed much of the portfolio derisking undertaken following the crisis. We are beginning to see the benefit of our investment spending as card accounts, purchase sales and loans have all stabilized and are now beginning to grow. We believe this will drive positive operating leverage by the end of 2012. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">In International Consumer Banking, we had positive operating leverage overall this quarter as both Latin America and Asia generated positive operating leverage, building on the momentum started by Asia in the third quarter. While we are seeing some slowing in certain drivers, like investment sales in Asia, reflecting again the cautious sentiment of even retail investors, broadly speaking, we continue to see growth in loans, deposits, purchase sales and accounts in virtually every region. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">In Citi Holdings, the transfer of Retail Partner Cards business will result in approximately $45 billion of assets, including $41 billion of loans moving to Citicorp. As a result of this transfer, earnings in Citi Holdings will be lower going forward as the cards business was the single source of meaningful profitability in Local Consumer Lending segment in Citi Holdings. Nonetheless, we are reaffirming our prior guidance that existing reserves plus expected pre-provision net revenue in the Local Consumer Lending business remain sufficient to cover expected lifetime losses in the remaining LCL portfolio. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">We continue to believe mortgage-related issues are the single largest source of risk facing the U.S. banking industry. While we expect our overall delinquencies to rise slightly in coming quarters as some previously modified mortgages start re-defaulting, to date, those re-default rates remain below our expectations. Despite the expected delinquency increase, we saw some positive signs in early bucket mortgage delinquencies this quarter that we will continue to watch carefully. In the meantime, litigation and regulatory risk in the mortgage business will remain high and we continue to focus on further reducing our portfolio. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So, in summary, the uncertain macro environment will continue to be a meaningful headwind for our Securities and Banking business, but our consumer businesses and Transaction Services should continue to exhibit growth, and we will continue to wind-down Citi Holdings in an economically rational manner. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">With that, Vikram and I would be more than happy to take your questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p9\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Glenn Schorr with Nomura.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">You gave a lot of comments around expenses, so I appreciate that. When you were talking about the year-on-year potential pullback of $2.5 billion to $3 billion, can you give a thought on just, a, geography -- and I don't mean that international, I mean more by business. Meaning, it looks like you're still growing all the consumer businesses and what you want to come out in international franchise. Is there -- it leaves me thinking the IB might be one of the source of funds, so just curious there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yes, I'm not going to go into individual business guidance at this point in time, Glenn, all right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. Let's attack it maybe a little differently. In the S&amp;B, you talked about focus on aligning capacity with the -- and the size of the opportunities. This has been obviously a tough market and there are cyclical pressures as you mentioned. But how do you get your arms around the rule changes happening and then the revenue environment falling? How do you weigh that cyclical versus secular? And what's the timing on making those decisions because it has a big impact on how you size the infrastructure?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I think that's right, Glenn. And certainly, by all means try to parse out secular versus cyclical is not easy. And I think we've tried to do that this quarter, 2 different sets of actions. The cyclical aspect, obviously, we've addressed for compensation. And on the secular side, some of the restructuring reserves that we've taken and the positions we eliminated try to get at that secular aspect of the markets. Now if you kind of think about the environment, there are still some significant overhangs and that's notwithstanding the fact that the market activities this year so far have been significantly better than fourth quarter. They're still running below the first quarter of last year, but there are questions out there. Questions such as, how is the Greek situation going to be resolved and it's March 20 and that's before the fiscal compact gets signed. These are all the kind of situations that are still out there, which suggests that it's very hard to parse out exactly what part of the activity we're seeing is because of the cyclical situation versus how much of secular. Now there's no magic answer to that except, I can tell you, we are keenly watching that and we'll make whatever changes we need to make.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So I guess, I'm sure you all get the same thing I get from investors and probably your board, too, of trying to understand what you have at your fingertips in the capital markets business that's fixed versus incentive comp, and I don't know if you can talk towards that. But I still want to get towards the timing because I don't have the crystal ball either, but the investor base wants to know an action plan. Can -- in 2012, do you think we'll see either an improvement in activity or something more material on the structure of the business?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I think -- I hope that 2012 is the year where we get the European overhang out of here. And that would be a significant shift that would then allow one to gauge what's happening on a much more normalized basis. And with that in mind, we're certainly thinking about 2012 as the year where you won't make a lot of those decisions. Having said that, again, I want to go back to saying that the actions we've taken so far are our best view as to what reflects the secular actions we need to take. As I said again, we'll keep monitoring it and if that changes, we'll take those decisions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. And then just final quickie, on international consumer, I know it gets messed up a little bit with FX and what's constant dollar, but you mentioned a little bit of slowing in Asia investment sales. Is everything else on the international consumer engine still growing and headed in the right direction in your mind? A simple answer.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Absolutely.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">John, could you give us a little feel for what drove the increase in legal reserves for the interchange issue?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Well, as we take a look at what our potential exposure is under the interchange litigation, we needed to increase the level of reserve that we had.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. So you're just looking ahead to the case that will come into court, I guess, in September of this year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I'm not quite sure of what the date is. I know it's later this year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. And then on net interest income and the margin, this quarter, we saw the net interest margin percentage up, but your average earning assets down. A little bit of color on what happened this quarter, and then just some thoughts on the outlook for net interest income and margin, please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes. From a NIM point of view, as you note, our net interest margin improved by about 7 basis points this quarter. But a lot of that was driven, probably about 5 basis points of the 7 basis point increase was really driven by the fact that we took down our trading assets. And trading assets have got some component of interest-earning assets in there. We tended to take down the lower -- those trading assets with the lowest-earning rate. So I would look at that as almost being a -- almost like a one-off benefit that we got this quarter, John. I would anticipate that with some modest growth again in our trading assets, we'll probably be back to a 2.85%  NIM ratio next quarter, give or take 1 or 2 basis points.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. And in terms of growing net interest income, you've had some loan growth across the franchise. What will be the key to your ability to grow net interest income this year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Well, don't forget, you still have -- you're still fighting a couple of trends. We're able to grow loans, but we still -- in Citicorp, we still have those Citi Holdings loans coming off the books. And the Citi Holdings loans tend to have, with the exception of, say, Student Lending, those student -- those Citi Holdings loans have got some higher spreads than the loans that we're building on Citicorp. So we're still going to be -- we were having a little bit of a fight as far as just swimming upstream a little bit, working our way through the reductions in Citi Holdings and offset by Citicorp. And then you've got -- we're still existing in a very low interest rate environment. So it's hard to point right now to solid growth trends in net interest margin. I think you can say at this point in time that we feel pretty good that absent that onetime benefit that you see this quarter, that NIM should roughly stabilize.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. And then also, a different question on DTA. Could you update us whether you consumed or built DTA this quarter on a net basis and what your expectations might be to recapture DTA in 2012?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes, fine, John. This quarter, we would have generated additional DTA. So in your parlance, we would have built DTA. I think the important thing for DTA is to look where we are on a full year basis. We started the year at about $52 billion of DTA. We'll end the year at about $51 billion. But more importantly, as we've discussed in the past, are the real components of the DTA. And you'll recall, last year -- and when -- and you'll see this laid out in more detail when we publish our K. When you looked at that portion of the DTA, that really reflected U.S. federal DTA. It had a sizable component in it about $4 billion compromising NOL carryforwards. And what we were able to do this year is we've been able to completely utilize that NOL carryforward. So that will leave us, in 2012 now, able to address the monetization of the carryforward, deferred the foreign tax credits. As you may recall, we can't begin to utilize the foreign tax credits until we worked our way through the carryforward NOL. And it's the foreign tax credits that tend to expire more near term. We have some of those coming off, expiring in '17 and '18. So it was important from our point of view to work our way through the NOL this year. And now we'll be able to address the utilization of those carryforwards foreign tax credits beginning in 2012.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. So even though the total DTA only came down by $1 billion for the year, you did get that $3.5 billion or $4 billion of NOLs that you were shooting for?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes. As we said, there's 2 different things to look at with DTA. One is the overall gross amount of the DTA. But more -- almost more importantly are those component pieces. And so while the gross amount only came down by that $1 billion, I think that we significantly improved the mix of the remaining DTA by removing that NOL carryforward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. And last thing from me, I know you can't get into specifics, but if you or Vikram could just talk about what your goals and hopes are for capital return this year and what you hope to be able to do after the stress test and what your goals are in terms of what the stress test will show for Citigroup?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes. Again, lot of that we submitted early this year to the Fed. They've got our stress test under their scenarios. They've got our capital-creation projections this year. They also have our capital return requests built in there as well. And what I would say to you is that we continue to have the same goals that I mentioned before, which is that this will be the year that we'll start returning capital. We also have the same goals in terms of getting the capital above 8% by the end of the year. None of those things have changed, except that the filing's gone into the regulators. And now all of us are just going to have to wait and see exactly when the response comes back.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question comes from Guy Moszkowski with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Just a follow-up on that question. The -- you've obviously targeted 8% to 9% Basel III capital ratio by the end of this year for some time. Given the uncertainty in Europe, the challenging global growth outlook that you've kind of talked about and just picking up on what you just said about above 8%, should we be assuming that your target is sort of to the low end of that 8% to 9% range right now?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I, again, it's hard to -- when we say 8% to 9%, it is 8% to 9%, and that's clearly true. Obviously, we and all of us are aware of the environment we're going through, and we are still targeting in between that 8% to 9%. So it depends upon a number of other actions that we've planned as well. So it's a little early to guide you to any one particular point.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. And then just if I can go back to the discussion of expenses. I recognize that you don't, at this point, want to be pigeonholed into where you're going to target some of these expense reductions that you're talking about. But in Citi Holdings, in the Local Consumer Lending group in particular, is it fair to say that the reduction in expenses as the assets have come down has been slower than you might have expected? And is there anything that you can do as you continue to get a reduction in the portfolio there besides the transfer of assets that we should think might accelerate the reduction in the cost that you have against those pretty unproductive assets?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes, Guy, that's a great question. There's probably -- there's several things that you need to think about when it comes to the Holdings' expense levels, because you're right. Assets came down 25% in Holdings during the course of the year. Expenses came down something on the order of 8% or so. But you need to think in terms of one, we did have some increased episodic legal and related expenses in Citi Holdings this year. That probably added $0.5 billion to the expense base. So it's hard to say that we could drive expenses down and absorb those increased episodic legal expenses. The second thing is, as we -- after we made the decision to move the Retail Partner Cards business back into Citicorp, we certainly increased the level of investment spend that we were making in that business. So you'll see some adjustment in the Holding levels -- Holdings' expense levels as we move Retail Partner Cards out as well. And we'll do that on a -- well, on a full restatement basis, so that we'll take the history out so you'll get a cleaner history of Holdings. The third aspect of that is we have had some incremental level of expenses in our residential mortgage business this year as we have put on additional headcount to meet the terms of the consent order that all the banks signed with the regulators earlier this year. So that had somewhat of a modest impact on the expenses themselves. And then the last factor -- I'm sorry to drag you through every little factor, is as we sell businesses in Holdings, and that's everything from the Student Loan business and other things that we've conducted, normally there's a transition period. We did this with auto loans. We do it with student loans. There's a transition period where we continued to support the transferred business. Now we get paid for that support, but what we get paid comes in through the revenue line while the expenses remained in our expense line. So all of that tends to mask what you should really begin to see as the reduction in those Holdings expenses. I still feel very confident that after we moved out partner cards and if you can adjust for some of these things like these ongoing service levels activity, you'll see that expenses are coming down closely aligned with the reduction in assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>James F. Mitchell - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Just a quick question on the expense reductions again. Can you at least give us a sense of -- is that mostly coming from headcount reductions and other efficiency gains? Or is there some pullback on the investment spend?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Well, I think as we've said, we're not going to be increasing investment spend at the same level that we increased it in 2011. 2011, we increased investment spend year-over-year by about $3.9 billion as we've talked about. We're not targeting a $3.9 billion increase in investment spend again next year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>James F. Mitchell - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">No, but is it going up or down, I guess is the question?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Well, the investment spend will go up slightly next year. All right? We're not going to pull back from investing in the businesses. But as we've discussed in the past, we do have an ongoing reengineering program. We, again, fully expect each one of our businesses to reduce expenses on an ongoing basis by 3% to 5% annually. This year, we took $1.9 billion out of our expense base. That's roughly 4% of last year's reported expenses. And without going into -- you're trying to forecast details, you should expect that we would be able to do roughly another 4% next year, which would take $2 billion out, which leaves us then the ability to still invest in the business and deal with some level of continuing episodic expenses and still hit the overall reduction that Vikram and I talked about.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>James F. Mitchell - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay, that's helpful. And then one other question maybe in terms of reserve releases. You guys were a little later to that game than some of your peers. So is it fair to assume that maybe at a declining level where we should still see, assuming the environment continues at the current rate of improvement, that we'd see some more reserve releases?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yes. Given the assumptions that you put out, that if things continue, the environment continues as it is. And don't forget, most of the reserve releases that we're doing now are really tied up in our 2 cards businesses. So it's really a U.S. type of view right now as far as reserve releases. But we continue to see NCL rates decline in that business. We continue to see delinquencies improving. So as long as the overall economy continues as it is now, and it continues to improve, yes, you should continue to see some level of reserve releases.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Just one quick question on expenses and then we can move on, I promise. Just you had said that the $2.5 billion to $3 billion decline that you expect for 2012 does not include unforeseen episodic issues. But do you bake in an elevated level of legal expense in those assumptions? Because it does seem like that's part of the environment that we're in, at least for the near term.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yes. I would say that the -- when we're talking about a $2.5 billion to $3 billion reduction, and that works you down to a number. You should assume that in that number, there is some level of ongoing litigation-type expenses. But we wouldn't expect it to be a repeat of 2011 where we had $2 billion worth of episodic legal and related expenses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay, fair enough. And then digging in a little bit into the equities results, this is the second quarter where we've had some weak derivatives results weighing down that business. Could you give maybe some color on what happened there and any steps that you might be taking to prevent more of the same?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yes, let me just start, and then I'll kind of let Vikram maybe finish about things to come. When you look at equities, I think there's 2 things that you got to think about. Overall, for the full year, in equities, our revenues declined by about $1.3 billion. About half of that decline was tied up in the principal strategies business, that prop trading unit that we mentioned last quarter and again this quarter. And that's a unit now where we have completed the wind-down. The other half, as far as the revenue shortfall year-over-year, was really in equity derivatives. And there's certainly at least an element in equity derivatives' performance that is market related. And then there's probably some element of it also that is a bit of an underperformance on our part. But you've got to think in terms of the full year, especially the second half of the year, was definitely impacted by those losses in the principal strategies group, and now we've wound that down.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I think the only thing I'd add to that is volatility, volatility was extremely high. And in addition to that, liquidity, even in some of the most liquid markets, like index options and index derivatives, dried up dramatically. And so when you're making markets for your clients, sometimes the market-making reflects -- market-making activity and market-making P&amp;L reflects the underlying nature of liquidity in the markets and was not as good a quarter as we would've liked.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">A couple of maybe secondary questions here. But as we think about just the business activity in Securities and Banking and then your position, you did have some comments that you proactively derisked. And obviously, these hedges that you have on has some cost to it. Is there a way to quantify kind of the proactive cost of hedging and derisking? I realize some of it is opportunistic costs, but there is probably some direct costs as well?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">That's difficult. I mean, obviously, John Gerspach has given you one line on the CDS hedges, and that's one which was relatively difficult. But we got to the numbers to tell you exactly where they are. I think the broader issue is what you have stated. We've derisked a lot of these businesses. And when you have less risk to work, you make less money. And so the opportunity cost is an important piece, including derivatives and other books when you carry a lot of data, and you have a lot of hedges in place that can reduce the amount of revenues you generate. It's very hard to tell you that this is what it cost us because obviously, you can't run 2 businesses side-by-side, one with this and one without. And so that's a difficult exercise. We've chosen just to tell you that we actually ran our books in a very cautious way. And frankly, we thought that was exactly the right thing to do given the uncertainty that Europe represented.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. And then just separately, as we think about capital and the build to get to the 8% to 9% under Basel III, there's obviously the joint venture with Morgan Stanley and the brokerage business. Could you just remind us of when their call date is this year and the process at which they basically to figure out the price and what the impact would be to the capital? I think it might free up 20, 30 basis points or so, just remind us about some of those moving pieces.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yes, Matt. You pretty much have got it. The call date is -- it's either May 31 or June 1. I can't remember the exact date, but I believe it's May 31. And what will happen is about a month before that time, Morgan Stanley will hopefully notify us of their intent to exercise their call to buy 14% of the joint venture. So that's 14% out of the 49% that we currently own. And if we don't immediately reach agreement on a price, then we each agree on a third-party arbitrator who will come in and set a price.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. Am I right that when the deal was struck, there was a deal value of 10? And I think you or at least the media was reporting that the bid-ask spread was like $1 billion or so, plus or minus?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I don't know what the media reports.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question comes from Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Christoph M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Most of my questions actually have been asked, but if you've been derisking the trading books, should we see any of that in terms of risk-weighted assets coming down?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Chris, I think you'll see a couple of things. One, you can see, certainly in the -- just the level of assets that we've got on our balance sheet right now, balance sheet assets are down. When we publish our K, you'll see that our average VAR is down quarter-on-quarter. More importantly, and something that you won't see though, is the way that we really manage the businesses is by applying a continuous stress test on our businesses. And overall, I say that the stress losses in the second half of this year on our various trading books were reduced significantly compared to the levels that would have existed at the end of the second quarter. You're more likely to see this on a Basel II or Basel III risk-weighting assets. And so that's something that, as we get more into the later part of the year, we can probably talk about.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I guess, given that you talked about these expense reductions kind of not like contingent on the environment, I mean, this is what your plan would be kind of in normal course for 2012. And presumably, there are contingency plans above and beyond that, right? I mean, that's -- but I guess the question is, I mean, some of this must be being phased in. And what's the -- what is it going to be in terms of the run rate by the end of 2012? Will it be lower than where we're starting the year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Moshe, I'm not going to forecast the run rate by the end of 2012. But again, when you're talking about things being phased in, and I don't mean to continuing to beat a dead horse, but we have an ongoing cost reduction program built into each one of our businesses. And so we are continuously taking cost out of the business. Last year, we did take $1.9 billion of expense out of our businesses. Now we chose to invest $3.9 billion, an incremental $3.9 billion in the businesses, so that overwhelmed the cost reductions. But as we pare down on increasing that level of investment, the cost reductions that we've got can cover the level of investment and actually drop some cost savings to the bottom line.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Got it. Maybe just to kind of flesh that out, because I think in response to an earlier question, John, you had said that you would be increasing those investments. When you meant increasing, you meant increasing above 0 from like a 0-based budgeting-type of thing?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yes. If you take today as saying, okay, the level of investment spending that I've baked into the business is now my -- my now 0-based. We will be increasing that level of spend. We're going to open up more branches.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And presumably, given the fact that you've talked about kind of reaching a positive expense leverage in more -- in the entire company as opposed to just portions of the company, that $1.9 billion number should be a larger number, as well as the $3.9 billion being smaller?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yes. Yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question comes from Jason Goldberg with Barclays Capital.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Jason M. Goldberg - Barclays Capital, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Just, I guess, a bit of clarification. I guess it looked like trading fell off, as you mentioned, a lot in the last 3 weeks of the year, given your comments earlier in the quarter. But was that -- I guess you mentioned principal strategies. Was that just more derisking you did in the last 3 weeks? Was that tied to the year-end kind of mark process? Or just maybe a bit more color in terms of what actually drove that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Well, principal strategies was a business that we were winding down throughout the second part of the year. So that in and of itself wasn't a last 3 weeks of December rush on it. So that -- you can kind of take that off the table. December was just a month that we saw as being remarkably weak. I'd characterize this December as being something beyond what we would normally expect to see in seasonality. It just -- people just sat on the sidelines, and we just didn't see a lot going on during the month of December.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Jason M. Goldberg - Barclays Capital, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Got it. And then in your comments, you mentioned that mortgage re-default rates were coming in better than you had expected. I guess, any kind of hypothesis in terms of what's driving that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Well, when you get into the HAMP process, assuming you've done it correctly, you basically have reunderwritten the loan and it's actually quite an extensive process. And our re-default rates now on our HAMP modifications are running at something less than 15%. So that's clearly below certainly the expectations that us or the industry would have normally had going into the process. And then some of that carries over into just the normal modifications that we do. And I'd say that we're in an enhanced modification mode. And so even on our non-HAMP modifications, the re-default rates are running less than 25%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Jason M. Goldberg - Barclays Capital, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Interesting. And then I guess, just lastly, obviously, you're moving Retail Partner Cards back into Citicorp. OneMain Financial, I guess, been a lot of discussion around that, just your thoughts around the ultimate outcome for that unit?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Well, OneMain Financial, again, that's a unit that we'd like to find a buyer for. And I think that, that's where that's going to stay. It's a business that's a good business. You take a look at the -- some of the information we give you in the appendix slides, it's generating positive pretax income now for several quarters in a row, but it's just not a business that we see fitting with the strategy of Citicorp. So it's hard to see how we would just suddenly decide to make a transfer of that into Citicorp. That's just one that we're going to have to find the right buyer at the right time and deal with it that way.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Your next question comes from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Just a couple of questions. John, you mentioned one of the -- what appears to be one of the major benefits of some of the deleveraging of the European banks. I'm curious outside of Transaction Services, more in the lending businesses, are you seeing obvious signs there where you're gaining market share as a result of some of the pullback of the European banks? And does that -- do you expect that to help your loan growth this year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I think the most obvious place where you see it is in Trade Finance, and that's a pretty big number in terms of increase. And I think we can continue to see good momentum there, particularly given our global network. Corporate lending is a little bit more sporadic in the sense that not every corporation needs the liquidity. Lots of corporations, even in Europe, have a lot of cash. We think that some benefit may also accrue in terms of capacity or rationalization and things like derivatives markets and those kind of places where pricing structures may change on that. And so I think the bigger impact, as I said, the European banking system has a gross number of about $40 trillion of assets. As you can guess, that's substantially larger than the U.S. It depends on how you measure it and all of that, but it is a multiple. That number is coming down. And as that number is coming down, it's going to impact a lot of different aspects and not only in terms of product lines, but also geographically. I think the emerging market businesses are ones where we are quite present. And as I said earlier, the numbers that we understand, a 65% of emerging market debt is held by the European banking system. Well, that creates certain types of opportunities there as well. So it has to play out. It's going to play out in a very steady way because we've got to underwrite everything as carefully as we underwrite anything else. But the trends are certainly in the favor of those banks that have the capacity to step in.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And if I can, just a couple of quick questions on the consumer side of things. Domestically, are you still sticking to your goal of achieving positive operating leverage in North America basically this year? And has that accelerated at all given some of the positive trends you saw this quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I'm not going to accelerate the guidance on that at this point in time, but we do -- we are reaffirming that. We expect North America Regional Consumer Banking to generate positive operating leverage by the end of this year. But I'm not going to advance that timeline just yet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Fair enough. And on EMEA consumer banking, the credit trends there look quite good in the fourth quarter, certainly relative to the last couple of quarters. I guess that surprises me a little bit given some of the concerns raised in the media about the slowdown in several of the economies in Western and Central Europe. I guess I'm just curious how you're thinking about the potential for credit trend weakening in the consumer businesses in EMEA, given all the challenges in the Eurozone?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yes. We actually -- as you've noted, we really haven't seen that impact on our consumer business. Now remember, even in EMEA, it's the same strategy as we have everywhere around the world where we're focused on a specific customer segment. So -- but we're -- again, EMEA is a rather smaller part of our consumer franchise, but we don't see issues right now with our book of business in EMEA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">A quick question on the lending business and the S&amp;B. You highlighted the variances from the hedge gains and losses. Just wanted to understand what some of those big drivers are.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I'm sorry, what are the big drivers in the hedge gains and losses?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yes, what's driving the variance there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Counterparty spreads.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">So then a follow-up is just given the downgrades that happened. I mean, I know it's at a country level last week. Does that impact what kind of gains or losses you'd be expecting this coming quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">No, no. I mean, I don't want to say that a lot of our book is certainly -- there's not a lot of our book that's concentrated in Western Europe, which is where I think you've seen those downgrades that you're talking about. And then there's always that question as to whether or not the country rating drives down the corporate or the financial institution of rating. So most of our CDS hedges are against either individual -- these are specific hedges against the risk in our loan portfolio. And so they're either single-name risks or something where we've been able to construct a hedge against an industry group. But it's really not tied back into what you may be thinking about, Betsy, as far as the European sovereign CDS. That's not what we're talking about.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And is there anything else that the recent downgrades at the country level would impact your look forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Would impact my what?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Your look forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Look forward? No, no. Not from where we're positioned right now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Stephen D. Walker - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">This is actually Steve dialing in for Gerard. Starting Holdings, how much of the expenses -- what percentage would you say is legal in nature?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I don't have that. I've got the growth year-on-year. But when you take a look at the episodic expenses in Holdings for this year, I'd have to guess at it, Gerard (sic) [Steve]. And so -- I'm sorry, I just don't have that in front of me.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Stephen D. Walker - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay, that's fine. And also, just your loan loss reserves. Recognize that they're set by classified loans. Do you see that in a normalized credit environment that you'll get it below 2% from where it is right now? I think it's at 4%?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yes, it's a little over that, actually. It's 4.7%. Don't forget, that's a mix of both a corporate business and consumer business. I think you're going to naturally have slightly higher reserves in your consumer business, so I don't think we would get down to having an LLR ratio of 2% for the whole business. I don't want to sit here and forecast one for you, but 2% would sound pretty aggressive to me.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Stephen D. Walker - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay, got it. And just last question, and I apologize if this has already been mentioned. What are you expecting for your tax rate in 2012 effective?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Well, we don't talk about forecasting individual year tax rates. I'd say that as we continue to get back to a more normal operating environment, our tax rate should be something in the high 20s. In the, say, 28% range.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Your next question comes from Todd Hagerman with Sterne Agee.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee &amp; Leach Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Just quickly in terms of the Volcker proposal, we know the comment period ends next month in February. And assuming -- well, we don't know the rules, assuming the final rules come out later this spring for January implementation next year, how should we kind of think about the repositioning or kind of the timeline in terms of implementing that rule, so to speak? Is that kind of a second half 2012 kind of event? I mean, how should we kind of think about the residual impact of that proposal?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">That's a logistically difficult question obviously, because there are tremendous amount of details that yet we need to know about, and we don't know what they are. A lot of that has to do with the certifications and other things up and down the chain in terms of proprietary trading and how you approach making market. So let me answer it this way, I think the broad-based approach to Volcker, which is about prop trading, private equity, other things that we've already started making and those changes are occurring, as John said earlier, a lot of them are behind us, some more things to be done. But a lot of them are behind us. In terms of sort of the mechanics of putting in place a system we've started, obviously, as best as we can, but I can't tell you exactly when everything is going to come online yet because I don't know all the details.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee &amp; Leach Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Yes, I guess I'm more specifically talking about the fixed income component as opposed to the equities component, which is obviously more clear cut.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Again, I can't tell you off the top of my head exactly when it all comes together.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee &amp; Leach Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay. And then maybe just kind of a follow-up to the earlier discussion in terms -- Vikram, you mentioned Asia and your positive outlook there. Could you just -- and John perhaps, too, just give us a little bit more flavor, color in terms of just the restructuring and the repositioning that you've been doing in both EMEA and Asia. As you mentioned before kind of the secular component? But I'm just curious just kind of what -- the profitability was just less than expected this quarter in particular. I'm just wondering, again, how we should think about that business, how you're repositioning it and going forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I mean, let me talk about it this way. The biggest broad-based repositioning is towards less resources in some of the more developed markets and more resources in the emerging markets. That's a very big, broad piece. I think that works through all our businesses, Consumer, Securities and Banking, et cetera. But that's one big piece. The second big piece of restructuring is still towards those businesses that are more services-oriented, local consumer banking, those kind of -- restructuring towards the kind of activities that allow us to serve our clients by providing them services and loans. That's the second type of restructuring. Third type of restructuring is in reaction to our view as to what volumes are going to be in the different product areas. I think it is clear to us that some of the credit markets, securitization markets, some of the other derivative markets are going to have different kind of volumes than what we've been used to. We've been restructuring towards that. We've been restructuring towards volumes that may be lower as a result of Basel III charges in certain areas as well. So that's the third big round of restructuring. And I guess, on the volumes, the last part, I would say, is our general view is that with more companies, that will over time go public and more credit markets in the emerging markets that we're skewing our resources a little bit more in that area. So that's the big picture kind of perspective which -- John, you want to add to that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Well, I just -- when you take a look at Asia, don't forget that in this quarter, we actually had -- that Japan DTA write-down impacted the Asia geography. So when you're taking a look at Asia's results in Citicorp, about $120 billion -- $120 million of the write-off, I think it's $122 million of the write-off, impacted that. So that's a direct impact on the bottom line. The other thing is, Asia, the consumer business we talked a little bit about having an impact on lower investment sales this quarter. So that certainly impacts both the quarter-on-quarter, as well as the year-on-year comparisons. And when you take a look at what went on in Securities and Banking, they actually had a blowout quarter in the third quarter. So you're comparing fourth quarter to a blowout third quarter, which makes any sort of comparison difficult. They are down, revenues from where they were last year, and that's got a little bit to do with the equities derivatives market where we had a bit more of that impact hit us regionally in Asia than anything else. So I think there's just a couple -- it's a couple of singular events that hit in the quarter like the DTA write-down. And then some of it is a bit of a comparability issue where they had such a strong third quarter that it's a little difficult to compare fourth to third.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee &amp; Leach Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">That's helpful, John. And so I'm just assuming again just all else being equal that, again, that the positive operating leverage kind of where we were year-over-year that, that would be the expectation for 2012 as well?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Yes. Certainly, our Asia consumer banking business, which is the one that we were giving that guidance on, we expect that positive operating leverage. Now that they've had it 2 consecutive quarters, we expect that to continue.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Your next question comes from Mike Mayo with CLSA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">My question relates to the balance between investing for growth then shrinking for profitability. And the reason I ask that is just looking at the operating leverage. Quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year, 3 years, 5 years or 10 years, it looks like you've had negative operating leverage. So the real specific questions would be, number one, are you cutting enough? With revenues down $8 billion last year, you're looking to cut $2.5 billion to $3 billion. It seems like maybe you could cut more. The second question is, are you investing too much? If you look at the gap between revenues and expense, the growth last year, I get $11 billion taking your numbers. It might be $9 billion or $10 billion, but you're still going to invest, I guess, $4 billion or more taking last year's level. And the third question is perhaps, can you reduce the number of countries where you do business?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Let me start. John, you answer as well. Let's be clear. I think in any business like ours, you got a little bit of both going on. For example, we are investing against the emerging market consumer businesses because we expect them to grow. And at the same time, we've also demonstrated operating leverage which just is exactly to your point, which is having made the investments to start with. From here on, we expect them to self-fund a lot of the growth that's going to come from there. That's an example. We then go to our next business, which is the U.S. consumer business. We talked about investing in that. A lot of what we had to do is normalize some of the marketing spend in cards and as well, for that matter, in the consumer business, normalize marketing spend around the world. We've done that and we expect to see operating leverage coming out of that business as well. That's investment, but investment in a way that we think generates the operating leverage. Then you go to GTS. We've talked about that as well. There, we expect operating leverage sometime this year, middle of -- middle-ish of this year, something of that sort. And then you really get to the Securities and Banking business, which we've talked about before. That is a business which has been impacted by a combination of regulation, market uncertainty, volumes, a variety of different things. And that's a business where we are doing a little bit of both again. And by that, I mean that in certain of our local market foreign exchange businesses, local market consumer businesses -- not consumer, of trading businesses, there are some tweaking required in terms of investment. But by and large, there are large amount of businesses where we have reduced the amount of resources and hence the restructuring charge. So that's sort of the full picture of what's going on. I think John also stated that $3.9 billion may have been the investment number last year, but that's not the number next year. It's not going to be 0, but it's not going to be $3.9 billion And again, geared towards this kind of operating leverage momentum that we've started creating and plan to create going forward. Now that's to us the pattern of our investment and disinvestment, and it's consistent with where we think growth and earnings are going to come from going forward. John, you want to add to that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">The only thing I'd say, Mike, when you take a look at the revenues and you take a look at the overall Citigroup revenues, don't forget that one of the single biggest driver of the revenue reduction year-over-year is the revenue reduction in Citi Holdings. Citi Holdings revenues are down 33% year-over-year, as you would expect, because we're driving the assets down. So maybe a better way to look at it would be just on the Citigroup -- Citicorp plus Corp/Other. And again, there, certainly, we had revenues down year-over-year. It's 12%. And then you get into the individual business characteristics that Vikram mentioned, and that's really where we're focused. But I think we've got clean line of sight to positive operating leverage in the International Consumer Banking businesses, in North America Consumer Banking business, in GTS and the discussion keeps on coming back to what can we do to Securities and Banking, and that's a business that we are very focused on.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">I guess, if you strip this a few ways, you can still come up with negative operating leverage even at Citicorp revenue is down over $3 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">It is. It's down this year. You don't have to strip it out, it's down.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">I guess the general question is, Vikram...</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">The question is where we're going forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Well, Vikram, are you satisfied with the operating leverage the way it is today? I guess that's the core question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">We would like to see better markets and therefore, we'd like to see more revenues in Securities and Banking. That, to us, has been the biggest delta on a year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter basis. No, I'm not happy with those revenues in those businesses. A lot of that's related to the market. Some of it is related in terms of our continuing to execute in the right way. But what John said is important. The plan is -- has been to use 2011 as a year where we've made some of the catch-up investments, re-normalize some of the investments, put money to work where over the -- from 2008 through 2010, we had operated businesses very tightly, and to use 2012 as a year where we would start showing you operating leverage business by business by business. Some of that's already started, and some of that we expect to see this year. But that's the goal.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Last follow-up, I'll try one more time. Just are you satisfied with the expenses that are under your control, that you're doing really everything that you can?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">The answer to that is, yes. And not only that, I think John talked about $1.9 billion of reengineering. We have a robust reengineering plan in place. Don't forget that John also talked about a couple of billion of one timers in legal. No, I'm not happy with those, and those are not the kind of expenses we want to see recur as well. But the company and the businesses are on top of driving operating leverage and operating efficiency, and we are focused on keeping our expense base as low as possible, just as we are in this environment focused on keeping our risk under control and keeping a lot of liquidity on our balance sheet because we do continue to see a lot of issues out there, particularly in Europe, that we are all going to have to be prepared for.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Just one quick follow-up. How much of the investment spend in 2011 was in the S&amp;B business, the Securities and Banking business?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">The incremental investment spending in Securities and Banking was about $1 billion, Betsy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Okay. And is that going to persist into 2012, you think, as part of the investment spending?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">I don't see an incremental $1 billion needed to be spent in that business. That was money that we needed to spend in order to bring on some of the additional banking teams that we did. It also had some systems level investments in there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">I mean, does that $1 billion continue in 2012 or does it go away?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Well, that $1 billion is in our expense base, and it's a part of what we need to address.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">There are no additional questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to John Andrews.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>John Andrews</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Great.

Today's call will be hosted by John Andrews, Head of Citi Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions] Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objection, please disconnect at this time. Mr. Andrews, you may begin.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>John Andrews</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you, operator. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us this morning. As usual, on our call today, our CEO, Vikram Pandit, will speak first. Then, John Gerspach, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation in some detail, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we will be happy to take your questions. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results and capital and other financial condition may differ materially from those statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings and including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2011 Form 10-K. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">With that said, let me turn it over to Vikram.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">John, thank you, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us today. As you know, earlier today, we reported net income of $2.9 billion for the first quarter of 2012. x CVA and excluding the net gain from minority stakes, we earned $3.4 billion in net income or $1.11 per share. This is a significant increase both from the first and fourth quarters of 2011. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">While our business has operated in an improved environment, we also saw the benefit of our investments. We generated revenue growth and had positive operating leverage across all 3 of Citi's core businesses, that is, Global Consumer Banking, Securities and Banking and Transaction Services. Key drivers, such as loans in Citicorp, grew by 12% from the prior year, while we deepened client relationships and improved market share in several businesses. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Global Consumer Banking generated $10 billion in revenues in the quarter, up 5% from the previous year. Securities and Banking revenues rebounded, driven by particularly strong performances in Fixed Income. In Transaction Services, revenues were a record $2.7 billion, reflecting strong growth, particularly in trade finance, where our unique global footprint gives us a meaningful competitive edge. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Overall, net income x CVA for our institutional businesses increased 12% compared to first quarter of 2011 and was 4.5x larger when compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. We reduced our legacy assets in Citi Holdings by 7% during the quarter, and Citi Holdings assets are now at $209 billion or just 11% of our total assets. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">While the operating environment improved in the first quarter, there is still much macro uncertainty, and we'll continue to manage our risk carefully. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Let me now turn to capital and liquidity. First, let me share with you some numbers since we further added to our capital base during the first quarter. We ended the quarter with $122 billion of Tier 1 common capital and a ratio of 12.4% under Basel I, up from 11.8% at the end of fourth quarter. And for the first time, we're sharing our Tier 1 common ratio on a Basel III basis, which stood at an estimated 7.2% at the end of the quarter. Keep in mind that Basel III requires the deductions of certain minority holdings on a dollar-for-dollar basis from an institutions capital base, and the 7.2% figure reflects that. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In aggregate, our minority investments in unconsolidated financial institutions, such as Akbank and Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, amount to 120 basis points of deduction. As you know, we expect to reduce certain of these stakes over time. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">While we're at 7.2% now, we still expect to exceed 8% by the end of this year and have various paths to do so. In fact, based on our current analyst estimates of our earnings for the remainder of 2012 and anticipated actions, including the reduction of our stake in Akbank, we expect to be above 8% even if Morgan Stanley doesn't exercise its option to buy 14% of the MSSB joint venture this year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">On liquidity, more than 1/4 of our balance sheet is in cash or liquid securities. And even though the Basel III liquidity coverage ratio doesn't come into effect until 2015, we are at an estimated LCR ratio in excess of 125%. We have already exceeded the proposed requirements. As you can see, our capital and liquidity numbers are amongst the strongest in our industry globally. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">That leads me now to the CCAR process. While several capital actions were approved, such as redeeming certain series of outstanding trust preferred securities, we have to resubmit our capital plan to the Fed. However, we do understand that new factors may need to be taken into account in the resubmission, and that, in any event, we need to understand the process going forward in order to make a determination on what to include in our resubmission. At this point, we expect to receive additional information from the Fed this month, and we're required to submit our revised plan by mid-June. The Fed, then, has 75 days to review the plans, and that time frame stretches almost to the end of the third quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">As we consider our resubmission for this year, we also have to keep in mind that we will be resubmitting the 2013 capital plan to the Fed a short time later. We're having the conversations with the Fed, which will inform what we submit and what we ask for. And obviously, for all of us on the phone, that could range from resubmitting exactly what we asked for before all the way to waiting until the 2013 submission. We, that is the management and the board, will make a decision, which takes all of these factors in account, and of course, we'll have more to say later in the process. In the meantime, what I can promise you is that we expect to keep building our capital. We'll keep executing our strategy, and we'll take every step we can to generate strong returns for our shareholders. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Finally, as many of you know, we're commemorating our 200th anniversary this year. The central mission of our bank throughout has been to support economic progress. Our historic strengths: facilitating international trade flows, maintaining a strong presence in the world\u2019s largest cities and focusing on the emerging markets are well suited for today's connected world. We see positive signs throughout our businesses, and we're going to serve our clients by putting our unique capabilities to work for them. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Now let me turn this over to John who will review our results in detail, and then, of course, we'd be happy to take your questions at the end of that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Okay, thank you, Vikram, and good morning, everyone. Before I go into more detail on the quarter, I'd like to highlight a few significant items affecting our results. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">First, on the revenue slide -- on the revenue side, CVA and DVA were negative $1.3 billion in the first quarter as Citi's credit spreads tightened. We also benefited from a pretax gain of nearly $500 million related to minority investments. On the expense side, legal and related expenses remained elevated at over $500 million. However, repositioning charges declined to $66 million from over $400 million in the prior quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Now on Slide 4, we show first quarter results. Citigroup reported net income of $2.9 billion or $0.95 per diluted share. Excluding CVA/DVA and the minority investment gain, earnings were $3.4 billion or $1.11 per diluted share. Revenues of $19.4 billion were down 2% versus the prior year on a reported basis. However, excluding CVA/DVA and the minority investment gain, revenues were up 1% from last year as revenue growth in Citicorp outpaced the decline in Citi Holdings. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Expenses of $12.3 billion were roughly flat year-over-year on a reported basis. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation and the significant expense items I just mentioned, operating expenses were up less than 1%. Incremental investment spending was more than offset by efficiency savings. Credit costs of $3 billion were down 5% versus last year. Net credit losses of $4 billion were down 37% year-over-year, including incremental charge-offs of approximately $370 million in the first quarter related to previously deferred principal balances on modified mortgages, which I'll discuss later. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Excluding these incremental charge-offs, NCLs would have been down 43% from last year. Virtually all of the incremental $370 million of charge-offs was offset by a reserve release specific to the deferred principal amounts, and so the net impact was essentially earnings neutral. Excluding this specific release, the net reserve release in the first quarter would have been roughly $800 million, down from $3.3 billion in the prior year. Citigroup end-of-period loans were up 2% from last year to nearly $650 billion as strong loan growth in Citicorp continued to outpace the wind down of Citi Holdings and deposits grew 5% to over $900 billion. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On Slide 5, we show results for Citicorp and Citi Holdings, excluding the impact of CVA/DVA. Citicorp generated first quarter revenues of $19.4 billion and net income of $5.2 billion. Year-over-year, Citicorp's revenues and expenses grew by 6% and 1%, respectively, with positive operating leverage in every business. Pre-provision net revenues in Citicorp were over $9 billion for the quarter, up 12% from last year. And for the fifth consecutive quarter, we grew loans year-over-year in every business in Citicorp. Citicorp's loans grew 12%, with consumer up 6% and corporate loans up 23%. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Citi Holdings had revenues of $786 million and a net loss of $1.1 billion. Citi Holdings ended the quarter with $209 billion of assets, down $16 billion during the quarter and $86 billion or nearly 30% year-over-year. At quarter end, Citi Holdings accounted for just under 11% of total Citigroup assets. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On Slide 6, we show a 9-quarter trend for Citicorp's results. Excluding CVA/DVA, Citicorp's revenues of $19.4 billion in the first quarter were up 6% from the prior year and up 23% from the prior quarter, driven by growth in each of our core businesses. Operating expenses of $10.3 billion were up slightly versus the prior year on a reported basis. Excluding the impact of FX and the significant expense items I noted earlier, expenses were up 2% on higher volumes in Consumer Banking and Transaction Services. Incremental investment spending was more than offset by efficiency savings. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Citicorp's net credit losses were $2.2 billion, down over 30% from the prior year, driven by improvement in North America cards. The net loan loss reserve release in Citicorp was significantly lower this quarter, at $588 million compared to $1.8 billion last year. This reflects lower net releases in North America cards, as well as reserve builds in international Consumer Banking and the corporate portfolio, primarily driven by loan growth. Excluding CVA/DVA, earnings before taxes of $7.4 billion were up 12% versus last year and more than double from the prior quarter, driven by higher revenues and lower net credit losses, partially offset by a lower net reserve release. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On Slide 7, we show results for our global consumer bank. In the first quarter, we generated $10 billion in revenues, up 6% year-over-year on a constant dollar basis. International revenue growth has accelerated in recent quarters, reflecting our investments, while in North America, the turnaround continued. Excluding loan loss reserves, we have steadily grown our pretax earnings each quarter for over 2 years, with strong recent growth in North America. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Slide 8 shows the results for North America Consumer Banking, which now includes retail partner cards and Citi retail services. Total revenues of $5.2 billion were up 5% versus last year, largely driven by higher gains on sales of mortgage loans. Card revenues declined year-over-year, reflecting spread compression in branded cards due to the continued impact of the look-back provisions of CARD Act and higher promotional balances, as well as lower average card loans. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Expenses of $2.3 billion were up 3% year-over-year as incremental investments were partially offset by efficiency savings and the absence of a litigation reserve in the prior year. Credit costs declined by nearly 1/3 from last year to $802 million. Net credit losses were down 31% to $1.6 billion, driven by cards, and the net reserve release was $841 million this quarter compared to $1.2 billion in the prior year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Earnings before tax, excluding the impact of loan loss reserves, grew to $1.2 billion from less than $300 million last year. Overall, we continue to see progress in our North America consumer franchise. Average deposits grew for the fourth consecutive quarter, up 4% year-over-year, including double-digit growth in checking account balances. In branded cards, accounts also grew for the fourth consecutive quarter, up 5% year-over-year, and purchase sales grew 3%. And in retail services, purchase sales were up 2%. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to international Consumer Banking on Slide 9. In total, the international consumer businesses achieved positive operating leverage for the second consecutive quarter, with reported revenue and expense growth of 4% and 2%, respectively. On a constant dollar basis, revenues grew 7% and expenses were up 5%. Revenue growth continued to reflect improvement in most underlying drivers, offset by spread compression due in part to the continued migration to higher quality borrowers. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Accounts grew 6% year-over-year, and on a constant dollar basis, we grew average deposits, average loans and purchase sales in every region in the first quarter. Investment sales remained lower than the prior year. However, we saw a rebound from the fourth quarter as retail investors sentiment improved. As I noted, expenses of $2.9 billion were up 5% on a constant dollar basis, driven by volume-related costs as modest incremental investment spending was more than offset by efficiency savings. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Credit costs were $799 million in the first quarter as compared to $490 million last year. While net credit losses declined modestly to $649 million, we recorded a net reserve build of $106 million in the first quarter, principally due to portfolio growth versus a net release in the prior year. Earnings before tax, excluding the impact of loan loss reserves, grew 15% year-over-year to $1.3 billion. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On Slide 10, we show growth trends for international Consumer Banking in more detail. On a constant dollar basis, average loans grew 12% over the prior year; average deposits were up 3%; and purchase sales grew 13%. As reported, on a trailing 12-month basis, we have grown both net credit margin and pretax earnings, excluding the impact of loan loss reserves, each quarter for over 2 years. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Slide 11 shows our Securities and Banking business. Excluding CVA/DVA, revenues of $6.7 billion were up 6% from last year and more than double the revenues of the prior quarter. Investment banking revenues of $865 million were up 2% from the prior year on strong debt underwriting activity and up 36% sequentially as both equity and debt underwriting rebounded from fourth quarter levels. While M&amp;A activity remains under pressure in the current environment, Citi has gained share in announced M&amp;A year-to-date. x CVA/DVA, equity market revenues of $902 million were down 18% from the prior year on lower market volumes. However, sequentially, revenues were up significantly on improved trading performance in derivatives and higher cash equities revenues. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Fixed income market revenues, x CVA/DVA, of $4.7 billion were up 19% year-over-year and more than double from fourth quarter levels, driven by strong performance in G10 Rates and local markets foreign exchange. Lending revenues of $56 million were down significantly versus prior periods as strong growth in net interest revenues was more than offset by over $500 million of losses on lending hedges in the first quarter, driven by spread tightening. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Private bank revenues, excluding CVA/DVA, were $576 million, up 11% versus each of the prior periods on growth in deposit and loan volumes, as well as stronger capital markets activity. Total operating expenses of $3.7 billion were down 2% from last year, driven by efficiency savings, and credit costs were $58 million in the first quarter versus a benefit of $187 million last year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Moving to Transaction Services on Slide 12. Revenues of $2.7 billion were up 7% from last year as strong growth in Treasury and Trade Solutions more than offset a decline in Securities and Fund Services. Treasury and Trade Solutions was up 11%, driven by strong growth in deposits and trade loans. Securities and Fund Services was down 4% year-over-year. However, revenues grew 5% sequentially as activity levels began to rebound from the fourth quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">The underlying drivers for Transaction Services continue to show strong momentum. End of period trade loans were up nearly 60% from the first quarter of last year, and average deposits were up 6%. Assets under custody were flat year-over-year, but up 4% from the prior quarter. Expenses of $1.4 billion were up 3% versus last year on higher volumes, as incremental investment spending was more than offset by efficiency savings. Importantly, we achieved positive operating leverage in Transaction Services in the first quarter, and this should be sustainable going forward. Strong revenues, combined with a modest increase in expenses, drove 10% earnings growth year-over-year to over $900 million. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On Slide 13, we show a 9-quarter trend for Citi Holdings. The reported loss in Citi Holdings was $1 billion in the first quarter, slightly higher versus last year but improved from the prior quarter. Revenues, excluding CVA/DVA, were down over 50% year-over-year to $786 million, due primarily to lower assets, as well as the absence of positive private equity marks in the prior period. Operating expenses of $1.2 billion were down 16% versus last year, and total credit costs were down 21% to $1.3 billion. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Looking at Citi Holdings in more detail on Slide 14. Revenues in Brokerage and Asset Management were negative $46 million this quarter, down from last year due to a lower contribution from the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney joint venture, as well as higher funding costs. In Local Consumer Lending, revenues were down 13% versus last year to $1.3 billion, driven by declining loan balances. In the Special Asset Pool, revenues, x CVA/DVA, were negative $494 million in the first quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Net interest revenue was negative $102 million as interest-earning assets continued to represent a smaller portion of the Special Asset Pool, while we continued to incur funding costs on the total portfolio. Noninterest revenue, excluding CVA/DVA, was negative $392 million, down $353 million from prior year, driven by the absence of positive private equity marks in the prior year period, as well as a reserve build of $150 million related to private-label mortgage securitizations. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Citi Holdings operating expenses were down 16% year-over-year to $1.2 billion, mainly due to declining assets, partially offset by higher legal and related costs. Credit costs were down 21% year-over-year to $1.3 billion. Total net credit losses were down 43% to $1.7 billion, reflecting a significant reduction in loans in the Special Asset Pool, as well as a declining loan balance and improved credit trends in Local Consumer Lending. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On a sequential basis, net credit losses were up $222 million, driven by an increase in North America mortgages. As I noted earlier, in the first quarter, we recorded roughly $370 million of incremental charge-offs related to previously deferred principal balances on modified mortgages, virtually all of which was offset by a specific reserve release. These charge-offs were related to anticipated forgiveness of principal, largely in connection with the national mortgage settlement. Excluding the incremental charge-offs, net credit losses in Citi Holdings would have declined 10% sequentially. In total, we released $576 million of net loan loss reserves in Citi Holdings compared to $1.5 billion in the prior year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Slide 15 shows Citi Holdings' assets. We ended the quarter with $209 billion in Citi Holdings or just under 11% of total Citigroup assets. The $16 billion reduction in the first quarter was comprised of roughly $4 billion of asset sales and business dispositions, approximately $11 billion of net runoff and paydowns and $1 billion of net cost of credit and net asset marks. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Slide 16 shows the results for the Corporate/Other segment. Revenues of $500 million were up significantly from last year, mainly driven by the $477 million net gain related to minority investments, which I described earlier. Expenses were up $148 million versus last year, driven by higher legal and related costs. Assets of $312 billion included approximately $121 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $135 billion of liquid available-for-sale securities. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Turning to total Citigroup expenses on Slide 17. First quarter expenses of $12.3 billion were roughly flat to the prior year, with both periods including a similar combined level of legal and related costs and repositioning charges of around $600 million. Adjusting for these items, as well as the impact of foreign exchange, core operating expenses grew less than 1% in the first quarter. Incremental investment spending of $400 million was more than offset by nearly $600 million of efficiency savings. We continue to be highly focused on managing our core operating expenses. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Slide 18 shows total Citigroup net credit losses and loan loss reserves. NCLs continued to improve in the first quarter, down 4% sequentially to $4 billion, and the net loan loss reserve release was $1.2 billion, down from $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter. Excluding the incremental mortgage charge-offs I mentioned earlier of roughly $370 million, NCLs would have been down 13% sequentially and the net reserve release would have been roughly $800 million. We ended the quarter with $29 billion of total loan loss reserves, and our loan loss reserve ratio was 4.5%. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Consumer NCLs were stable versus the fourth quarter at $4 billion even with the incremental mortgage charge-offs, and we released $1.3 billion in consumer loan loss reserves. Corporate credit costs were $29 million in the first quarter compared to a net benefit of $158 million last quarter as we recorded a net build in reserves this quarter versus a release in the prior period. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Slide 19 shows our international consumer credit trends, which generally remained stable to improving in Citicorp in the first quarter as loans continued to grow. In Asia, the NCL rate continued to improve in the first quarter and 90-plus-day delinquencies were fairly flat at around 50 basis points. In Latin America, the sequential decline in NCL rate reflects, in part, the absence of adjustments in Central America, which resulted in higher credit losses in the fourth quarter. However, even excluding these adjustments from the prior period, the NCL rate would have been improved sequentially. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">In Local Consumer Lending in Citi Holdings, net credit losses were down quarter-over-quarter on a dollar basis. However, the NCL rate increased on a lower average loan balance. The increase in the 90-plus-day delinquency rate was also primarily driven by the decline in loans. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">On Slide 20, we show the North America mortgage portfolio in Citi Holdings split between residential first mortgages and home equity loans. Regarding the incremental charge-offs of about $370 million in North America real estate, approximately $315 million was attributable to residential first mortgages, with the remainder in home equity loans. Excluding this action, total net credit losses for North America real estate in Citi Holdings would have been down slightly versus the prior quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">In residential first mortgages, we ended the quarter with $65 billion of loans, down 14% from a year ago. Excluding the incremental charge-offs in the first quarter, net credit losses would have increased by 4% from the fourth quarter. 90-plus-day delinquencies remained stable in the first quarter at just over $4 billion. However, we continue to watch these trends closely. In home equity loans, we ended the quarter with nearly $39 billion of loans, down 13% from a year ago. Excluding the incremental charge-offs in the first quarter, net credit losses would have been down 5% sequentially, and 90-plus-day delinquencies were also down versus the prior quarter at roughly $900 million. In total, we continue to allocate nearly $10 billion of our total loan loss reserves to North America real estate lending in Citi Holdings. And excluding the incremental NCL action this quarter, we maintained over 30 months of coincident NCL coverage. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">On Slide 21, we show our key capital metrics. Our total Tier 1 capital ratio was 14.2% as of the first quarter, and our Tier 1 common ratio was 12.4%, up 60 basis points from year end. We also grew our tangible book value to $50.90 per share. As Vikram noted, at the end of the first quarter, our estimated Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III was 7.2%, and this included approximately 120 basis points of impact from our nonconsolidated minority investments in financial companies, including the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney joint venture and Akbank. We continue to expect to be above 8% Basel III -- above our 8% Basel III target even if Morgan Stanley does not exercise its option to buy 14% of the JV this year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Now let me close with some comments about the outlook. First, Global Consumer Banking, our largest business, continues to produce good growth in revenues and earnings, as well as in key drivers like loans and deposits. Credit quality remains good in Asia and Latin America and continues to improve in the U.S. We produced positive operating leverage across all major regions in consumer banking in the first quarter, although we do not expect to see sustained positive operating leverage in North America until the end of the year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Transaction Services also continues to produce strong revenue and earnings growth and had positive operating leverage a quarter earlier than we had previously expected. Treasury and Trade Solutions is driving the growth in Transaction Services, reflecting our ongoing expansion in trade finance, where our unique and large global footprint gives us an unmatched competitive advantage. We are optimistic that Transaction Services will have sustained growth and positive operating leverage in the coming quarters. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">In Securities and Banking, there were a few key takeaways this quarter. First, we believe our underperformance in equities in the second half of last year is behind us. Our proprietary trading business is gone, and our equity derivatives business recovered well, which, we believe, reflects changes we made to that business, including new leadership. Second, our investment banking franchise is beginning to see market share gains in M&amp;A and equity underwriting, while our strong debt underwriting business continues to perform. We think those gains could be an early sign that the investments we made in investment banking resources are beginning to pay off. And finally, our fixed income business continues to perform well and had a particularly strong first quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Overall, we continue to remain highly focused on managing expenses while still investing in key areas. Expenses were relatively flat year-over-year, and we are still targeting 2012 expenses to be $2.5 billion to $3 billion lower than the 2011 reported numbers, excluding, of course, any large impact resulting from foreign exchange or any significant unanticipated items. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">In Holdings, the wind-down of assets will continue and our primary focus remains the mortgage portfolio. While our portfolio is smaller than our peers\u2019, we continue to believe that mortgages represent the greatest risk to any major bank balance sheet and a number of headwinds remain. More broadly, while the macro environment has improved compared to the second half of last year, there is still much uncertainty, which has been underscored by the recent spate of mixed economic data and rekindled eurozone fears, so we will continue to manage risk carefully and to maintain a strong balance sheet. We remain very optimistic about our prospects given our client franchise, our unique mix of businesses and our unparalleled footprint. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Vikram and I will now be happy to answer your questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p8\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr of Nomura.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Curious in the whole CCAR process. I'm curious what you've learned now that you've gotten some qualitative impact detail back from the Fed and what you learned on the international loss rates, how the Fed feels about them and if you've made any -- have any thoughts on the way you manage the business differently going forward as a result of the CCAR process.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yes, let me address that, Glenn. First, the one comment I'd make is if you take a look at CCAR and the stress test and kind of understanding, as you know well, stress tests are tail-risk events and tail-risk events implicitly tell you what kind of capital you should have against businesses. If you think about it that way, the weightings coming out of the CCAR process are very different than the weightings that come out of the Basel III risk-weighted asset process. That's a significant learning for all of us in the industry. Another way of saying that is risk-weighted assets in Basel III overweight risk in trading businesses, while the CCAR is much more in line with what true risk might be. And on the consumer side, the CCAR weightings are higher than the risk weightings on the Basel III process. So for all of us, obviously, the questions are around, well, how do you dovetail the 2? And we've always been of the point of view at Citi that our capital charges should be higher our risk capital or risk-weighted assets. And frankly, risk capital's shape, not the magnitude, but the shape of risk capital is much more in line with where the CCAR comes out than where the Basel III numbers are. And I think that's probably the single biggest determinant of where you'd want to put capital to some extent. Although it's early, I can also tell you, you can't necessarily take one year CCAR as given because as we've all learned, these stress tests can keep changing. Scenarios will change, but it is an indication that when you think about capital allocation in your businesses, you need to think about not only Basel, but risk capital, CCAR being one of the measures. That's the big picture kind of issue. On the narrower issues, Glenn, we continue to talk to the Fed, and we're going to continue to do that. We stand by our numbers, our stress test numbers, and we stand by our submission, and there's a lot more we need to do to get closer to understanding exactly how the next part of the process is going to work. And stay tuned, we'll have more to say later.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. On Holdings, so many moving parts this quarter with partner cards moving out and all the things that you noted on your prepared remarks. But long story short, revenues are shrinking faster than expenses, and we're still at about $1 billion a quarter of run rate loss. Is there anything besides just the mortgage world getting better that can improve that loss rate over the next couple of quarters?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Glenn, as we said in the prepared remarks, a lot of the interest-earning assets now from the Special Asset Pool have shrunk. So what we're left with in the Special Asset Pool now would be much more episodic revenue events, private equity marks up or down. And so I'm not quite sure that you're going to see a great relation between -- a tie-in between revenues and expenses. As we've been saying, we think that expenses should come down in Holdings as the assets come down. And if you adjust for -- as we gave you last quarter, if you take a look at what we've done on a year-over-year basis and you take a look at trailing 12 months, we've taken assets down somewhere around 29%, almost 30%. And adjusted operating expenses, removing litigation reserves and the whatnot, are down roughly 22% over the same time frame. So again, we're bringing expenses down roughly in connection with the asset reduction.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay, cool. Last one. If you look at your expense slide and you took that core operating costs running a little bit below $47 billion run rate, that's -- if I remember the math correctly, that's below the range of the 2 to 3 -- $2.5 billion to $3 billion below last year's operating run rate. Is there anything in particular that's running better? Because this was the -- first quarter's typically a pretty good investment bank quarter, so if anything, the thought was maybe first quarter's going to be on the high side of expenses, but it wasn't. Not complaining, it's a good thing, but just curious.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">As we said going into the year, we felt that we could bring the reported numbers for this year down $2.5 billion to $3 billion. We still think that we're on track for that. We talked to you in the past about our ongoing program to generate efficiency savings of between 3% and 5% on our businesses last year. For the full year, we ran $1.9 billion. You see that we already generated $600 million of savings in the first quarter. So we think that we've got good expense discipline in place, and at this point in time, we're going to stay with our full year view.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald of Sanford Bernstein.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">One follow-up to Glenn's question on Holdings, John. I guess, you still -- in terms of your guidance, you still expect over the life of Holdings for the existing reserves and PPNR to be sufficient to absorb the losses, something you said before.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yes, John, absolutely.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay, so you're losing $1 billion a quarter now, but that comes down as the charge-offs come down and I guess...</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Let me be specific because the guidance that we've given in the past and the guidance that I'll reiterate is that for the Local Consumer Lending, the combination of the PPNR, plus the existing reserves, will more than offset the lifetime NCL that we have.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. Over the life of all of that, all of your assets?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And on the mortgage, additional charge-offs that you had this quarter in Holdings, in LCL, is there a onetime catch-up component to that on these TDRs? Or is that something that episodically will come up again as you go through these restructurings?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Well, this is, if you want to call it a catch-up, it's really an advance of where we see -- what we see happening under the national mortgage settlement, where we will be generating a certain amount of principal forgiveness in response to our commitments under the national mortgage settlements. And so when we looked, there's deferred principal on some of our modified loans that will be forgiven as we get into this process. And so what you can expect, as most institutions get into the national mortgage settlement, should be an increase in both net credit losses, as well as reserve releases in their mortgage business. And what you see in our results today is basically the first installment of what you could expect to see on our part.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. And that you said that, that was P&amp;L neutral, but the provisions still went up in Holdings. Is that just that you had less reserve release elsewhere in Holdings?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes, that's exactly right, John.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. Another question on Holdings, just in terms of the Smith Barney Morgan Stanley joint venture. Just curious why does it not show up on your income statement as making money, even though it makes money for Morgan Stanley and it's a business that, obviously, we'd expect is profitable. Is there some accounting going on there, I guess?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes, that's exactly right. There's accounting that goes on there. When we account for it, it's not just the equity pickup that we have. We also reflect the funding costs that we have on the investment itself. There's some intangibles that we created in connection with the sale that we continue to amortize. So our reported numbers off the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney joint venture are more than just the reported results of the entity itself.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. And given the drag on Basel III capital that presents, is there any reason why you wouldn't be open to selling the entire stake if Morgan Stanley was? Does that just come down to price?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Well, we have our investment in Morgan Stanley's -- in the joint venture, in Holdings, so by definition, we're looking to exit that business. It's not part of our core operations going forward. Having said that, the capital numbers we're at and the progress we're making in the business also suggest that there is not a need to do that either, which is important to appreciate and understand. We've got plenty of time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Right. Like you mentioned you'd be above 8% even including it by the end of this year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">That's right.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay, and then just on the DTA itself, John, can you update us where that was at quarter end and whether you consumed anything this quarter in terms of DTA and just as you look out, what your expectations are, maybe to capture some DTA in 2012?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">John, actually the DTA for this quarter actually went up by about $400 million, and that reflects 2 specific headwinds that we had in the quarter. Number one, there is a component of the DTA that is expressed in foreign currency, and the FX impact on that particular asset caused a $200 million increase in that portion of the DTA. Secondly, virtually all of the CVA and DVA losses are incurred either in North America or in vehicles that consolidate into the North America consolidated tax return. And therefore, with those CVA losses, we actually generated an additional $500 million of DTA, so that's 2 items that add up to a $700 million headwind on DVA -- on DTA in the quarter. Absent those 2 items, we would have consumed about $300 million worth of DTA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. Any outlook in terms of this year, in terms of what you'd like to do aspirationally in terms of digesting some of that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Well, we don't anticipate consuming a lot of DTA this year. That is not something that is with our plan this year, but that is going to be highly dependent upon the profitability of our North America businesses and our ability to continue to wind down Holdings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. And that's the long-term driver just getting more profitable in the U.S. and having that Holdings loss go down?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">That's correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I wanted to start off with just a question on North America Consumer Banking. Clearly, a real positive that you were able to generate the positive operating leverage there in the quarter well ahead of when you were talking about doing it. But of course, there were some things that might not be completely sustainable there, and I was wondering if you could give us a sense of the order of magnitude of the improvement in the mortgage revenues because of the gains on sale.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes, we had roughly close to $500 million worth of gains on sale in mortgages this quarter. So again, that certainly added to the revenue stream in that business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And could you talk little bit about the dynamic in the market that -- besides the increase, obviously, in just in demand, but what was driving the spreads there and how sustainable might that trend be?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Well, the spreads did increase this quarter. Most of that, for our purposes, we've shifted our production to be much more based on our branches. So we use our branches now much more as a source of those mortgages, and we tend to get better production statistics out of mortgages originated in the branches than we do from third party.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So it sounds like what you're trying to say is, that some of that spread improvement is presumably sustainable because of mixed shift in how you actually originate the mortgages.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Well, as we shift the production to retail branches, some of the spread improvement should be sustainable. But I think anything to do with mortgages right now is one of these things that you have to take a look at with a certain amount of caution.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes, that's fair. All right, moving on to your ratings. Obviously, Moody's has talked about proposed changes to its rating methodology, and there's the potential for a downgrade to as low as Baa at the holding company level, and I just wanted to know what are you doing to mitigate some of the potential impacts from that happening, specifically with respect to your OTC derivatives business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Guy, that's a good topic. But I think it's important to remember that the Moody's review is -- it's really an industry-wide re-weighting. It's not just focused on Citi, and it's an industry-wide re-rating globally at this point in time. As we take a look at it, we've got, as we mentioned in our prepared comments, incredibly strong capital and robust liquidity. And as we think about it, as our investors and our counterparties, it's -- people are less and less solely relying on ratings of a single agency in making their decisions. Some might note changes in ratings from Moody's, but at this point in time, we don't think that the impact on us would be material. We think that we have prepared our business for whatever impact could be out there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And if I can just follow up on that thinking specifically about impact on derivatives businesses. To what extent do you think you can mitigate whatever impact there might be on that part of your business by novating [ph] derivative trades to the bank from the broker? Is there any reason that we would think that actions like that might be precluded in any way?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">When you get into those types of movements, they generate their own complexities, and so that's not something that we're looking at right now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Got it. Okay, final question that I have for you is just with respect to reps and warranties. You obviously showed some numbers in the appendix, I guess, to your slides about how those evolved during the quarter. And clearly, on the private label side, those are up. And I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about that. And also, should we relate that increase in some of those demands essentially to the litigation reserve build that I think we can detect in the Corporate and Other segment?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes, I wouldn't do any great linkage as far as trying to link reserve builds in one area to reserve builds in another, but that's up to you. Regarding -- from the mortgage -- from the reps and warranties slide that we've got back in the back of the earnings deck, as we've said, most of our experience to date has been in receiving rep and warranty claims from the GSEs, Fannie and Freddie, and we've built up a pretty good reserve on that. We continue to believe that the private label securitizations, different from the whole loan sales that we've done with the GSEs, those private label securitizations will largely be settled through litigation. But as we get claims -- specific rep and warranty claims in, we will take a look at them and then add to our reserves on an episodic basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken of UBS.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So first question is the $0.8 billion in nonaccrual -- second liens that you moved into nonaccrual this quarter, was your existing reserves fully reflected that move? And was that just for the regulatory shift?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes. It's actually -- we shifted about $840 million or thereabouts of junior lien -- high-risk seconds, junior liens into the nonaccrual status in response to some regulatory guidance that the entire industry got. And all of that was already reflected in our reserves.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Terrific. And then, moving on to MSSB, thanks for the disclosure on that 120 bps for MSSB and Akbank. What I was curious about was if as we think about the sale from MSSB, and obviously, timing is a big question mark and price. But if all of MSSB is sold, would that be completely dollar for dollar, net of any gains or losses that all accrete to capital, that full amount that you carry via the JV?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">The simple answer to your question is yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay, great. And then, how would we think about the sale -- corresponding sale of deposits to MS? What are the prices generally that are tied to brokered deposits and brokerage accounts? And how much of that is a gain?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I don't want to go into any specifics of what might be. As we get into it and we have something to announce on any of these transactions, we'll let you know.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. Is it right, though, to think that maybe those sales or deposits could be a somewhat meaningful portion or unlikely to be so?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Those deposits would be part of the business. They're part of the original agreement that we made, and we'll have more to say about the joint venture if and when there's anything to say about any potential sale.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. Last one for me. There were some reports -- some press reports that some banks were considering securitizing trade finance receivables. Is that something that Citi had looked at? And if so, could you sort of walk us through maybe how the economics -- how that would change the economics of that business for you?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Well, we like that business. Again, as we look at our balance sheet, we have got -- as Vikram said in his remarks -- 26% of the balance sheet right now tied up in cash and liquid securities. We have over $200 billion of cash. So we still have capacity to grow loans on our books. Having said that, any time you have asset concentrations, you're always looking at ways of reducing those or potentially reducing those concentrations. And so that could be a potential use of something like a securitization. But it's not something that we really need to engage in at this point in time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">But that's not where we are today either, on the concentration point. Don't forget these are very short-term assets, I mean. So on the securitization basis, it creates a lot of other complications. The best use for some of the deposit and cash we have on hand is these trade finance receivables.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay, okay. And actually, I'm sorry, I have one more quick one here. You had indicated that the $3.7 billion expense base in Securities and Banking reflects efficiency saves. So is it a good idea for us to assume that, that's a decent run rate now going forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I don't want to get into specific forecasting of individual business run rates. We'll stay with the guidance that, overall this year, you should expect the full firm expense base to reflect $2.5 billion to $3 billion lower than 2011.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell of Buckingham Research.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Quick question on the deposits. You guys were up, on a period-end basis anyway, $40 billion, a lot of that internationally and in the institutional side. I would have thought you would have seen outflows after the big flight to safety trade in the fourth quarter. So what's driving that? Was there anything episodic about the end of the quarter? Or was that just good sort of new business wins?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">No, most of it was -- I'd say it's continuing of existing business. We did change our deposit pricing slightly at the end of the quarter, particularly to deal with competitive pressures in Asia. But that would be the only place where we modestly changed deposit pricing, and we still think that we are well below where the industry is. So this is just good customer activity that we have at this point in time. What we're focused on is continuing to improve the mix of our deposits. And when you take a look at that $900 billion of deposits, about 70% of that would be core operating accounts. So we feel pretty good about the deposit mix.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay, fair enough. And maybe if we look at fixed income, we didn't really talk about that, but you guys were up 20% almost year-over-year. Sounded like JPMorgan was down modestly. Is that simply a function of your mix being more leveraged to macro strategies like rates in FX? Or do you think there was some market share pickup from European banks pulling back? And how do we think about it in the context of Moody's shot across the bow, if you guys are still doing quite a bit of business in the derivatives space? It seems like it hasn't really affected your ability to grab share.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">No. Derivatives are not a large part of our business. To the extent that we're involved in derivatives, it's particularly flow product, as opposed to having an out-weighted segment on OTC or structured derivatives. That's not a big part of our business. So we just -- our franchise performed very well this quarter, and we're very happy with it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Was it more a function of positioning? Or do you think there was some share gains?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I can't comment on share gain at this point in time after one quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay, fair enough. And one last question on the expense side. You guys are targeting $2.5 billion to $3 billion. I just want to make sure I understand what the base is. Are we excluding the legal costs in the first quarter to look at the run rate? Or is that inclusive of that higher legal cost in the first quarter in terms of the $2.5 billion to $3 billion?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">What we've said is that excluding unanticipated large items. There's nothing necessarily in the first quarter that I would put into that category at this point in time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Thanks for the commentary on Basel III, and I think you were helpful in giving us some of the deductions from the capital point of view. But any commentary on the increase in RWAs, as well as how you think you can mitigate that over the next couple of years, to be helpful?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">What we had said, I believe, is that our target for the end of this year would be to be at a Basel III RWA multiplier of like 1.35x Basel I risk-weighted assets. And we're already operating slightly below that, so we think we've made some good progress already on the mitigations, although we still think that there's room for further mitigations as we go along.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And how well -- as you look out more than just the near term, how much can you bring them in line with Basel III, do you think -- or sorry, Basel III and Basel I [indiscernible], like how much can they converge?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Well, the good thing is, from our consumer and our Transaction Services businesses, and I think we mentioned this in the past, we can -- we think that given the structure of our business, we can bring those amounts pretty much into parity. I'm not going to tell you we can do it exactly dollar for dollar, but the multiplier would be in the point 0 something range. So we feel pretty good about the assets in consumer and Transaction Services, and so the area of focus becomes Securities and Banking. And again, when you take a look at our construct of our Securities and Banking business, we think that, that fits well into a Basel III environment also. So previously, we would have said that the Citicorp businesses in total would have had a Basel III multiplier of 1.2. So in other words, of that 1.35x that I had given you for the full firm, about 1.2x would be for Citicorp. And looking at our business today, we're already slightly below that again for the Citicorp segment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">A couple of things. First, your comment about -- and it was earlier question about the mortgage sales kind of driving or smaller gains on sale driving a lack of positive operating leverage perhaps, what was the -- kind of where did you start the first quarter versus where you started the second quarter in terms of your pipeline on that? I mean, does it -- do you have a smaller amount available for sale for the second quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">No, no, no, Moshe, let me just try to be -- I want to make sure that we're going back to the same starting point. And what I mentioned is that we had $500 million or thereabouts of gain on sale in the first quarter. And what I further said was that we're just not ready yet to declare that we're going to have sustainable positive operating leverage in North America for the balance of the year until we get to the end of the year, as we had previously stated. Most of that is because in the first quarter, we also benefited from the lack of a litigation reserve that we had taken in the first quarter of last year. So if I pull that litigation reserve out, we actually had expense growth in North America year-over-year, as you would expect, since we are still in the process of investing in that business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Got it. So it's more -- it's just a normal investment in the business as opposed to...</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yes, yes. You shouldn't read into that anything, that we suddenly see our mortgage origination pipeline or mortgage modification pipeline or mortgage refinance pipeline suddenly drying up.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Got it. And just on Holdings and the expense change. I mean, I understand the 1 or 2 things that you highlighted. It still seems like a very large drop. And how sustainable is that because obviously, that would, at this level, would be much more favorable?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Well, don't forget, if you're looking at sequentially, that drop sequentially would include the fact that in the fourth quarter we had some rather sizable litigation reserves taken in Holdings, and we didn't repeat that at the same level in the first quarter of this year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And that was in the neighborhood of what, a couple of hundred million dollars?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yes, I don't have the exact amount in front of me, Moshe, but...</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Can you guys give us some color -- you've done a good job with the net interest margin over the last 12 months, can you give us some color on how you see it shaping up for this year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I'm sorry, Gerard, but you broke up just a little bit. I want to make sure we got the right question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Sure. On the net interest margin, you guys have done a good job keeping it around that 2.88 to 2.90. Can you give us some color on where you see it going as we move forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yes, when you take a look at our net interest margin, we had, I think, previously said that we had thought that the net interest margin might decline this quarter. And there's a couple of things that are working through the numbers, one of which is, from quarter-to-quarter, we did rebuild our trading book, and we get lower yields on the trading book. That actually cost us about 4 basis points on NIM against what we would have thought would have been a 6-basis-point-or-more decline. But at the same point in time, we've benefited from lower funding costs of about 2 basis points. And then, we also had a reserve release in our Japan Citi finance business that benefited us for about 2 basis points. So basically, you had a 4 basis point decline on the rebuild of the trading book and then 2 basis point good guys. So we basically held NIM at 2.90. I still think that in the second quarter, as we get a little bit more of a build in the trading book, and what I'm assuming is going to be an absence now of the good guys as far as the Japan reserve release, what you're likely to see is a slight decline in NIM in the second quarter, and NIM could decline in the second quarter to perhaps 2.85 thereabouts. And after that, what we would expect is that NIM should either be stable or perhaps grow slightly from there on out.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Another question. You guys gave us good disclosure on the GIIPS exposure that you have. And if I read the numbers correctly from the fourth quarter, it looks like your unfunded commitments, which is on Slide 33, came in at $8.1 billion this quarter, and your corporate's unfunded was $7.5 billion. Last quarter, I think it was $6.7 billion. Can you share with us -- I assume those are multinational companies, good credits. Are you taking market share? How are you winning that new business?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I wouldn't say that we're taking market share. What we're trying to do is support our customers in those countries, and that's something that we've said all along as we approached our exposure to the GIIPS. We're much more focused on direct exposure to sovereigns and FIs. We intend to be there for our customers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Sure. And then, finally, coming back to the CCAR process, you guys mentioned that by mid-June, you'll resubmit, and then the Fed has 75 days to respond. If you resubmit before mid-June, let's say, it's end of May, early June, will the Fed still have 75 days from mid-June? Or can we hear something earlier from the Fed?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">No, they have 75 days. And I want you also to know that this is going to be based off of March end numbers and we've got -- from what we understand, we've got to go through another full stress test in our resubmission. So this is the time frame. I think, it's a realistic time frame for everybody to be aware of.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay. And I think you also mentioned you guys will decide whether you want to do it versus just waiting until next year. Will you all disclose to us that, yes, you have resubmitted it? Or how will we find out about that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">We'll have our quarterly calls. We'll let you know next quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja of JPMorgan.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Vivek Juneja - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">A couple of questions. One is on this whole CCAR thing. Vikram, you just said you'll be resubmitting it based off of March numbers. Do you know if the assumptions that the Fed had used, would those change at all?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Well, that's exactly, Vivek, what we're waiting for. Those are exactly the conversations we're having. And as I said, we are likely to get more information from them between now and the end of the month, so it's still early in the process. And I wish I could share more with you, but that's kind of where we are.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Vivek Juneja - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay. A couple of other quick ones, probably for John. John, the mortgage gain on sale, just to go back to that, which you had about $500-ish million this quarter. Your originations went down about 35% linked quarter, yet your gains went up quite a bit. Was any of that coming from MSR hedge gains that went up?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">No, no, no. When you take a look at the gains that we get, gains get booked when we lock in rates, so that timing isn't always associated with how we report the origination results.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Vivek Juneja - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay, got it. Next one, LCL expenses, you were down to a little under $1 billion, a pretty sharp reduction. Should we assume sustainability at these levels? Or is there anything at all that's nonrecurring in that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">No, I don't believe there's anything nonrecurring in the first quarter expense level. As I mentioned to another questioner, the sequential drop, though, has to do, at least a certain amount, with the lack of litigation reserves that we had taken in the fourth quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Vivek Juneja - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Right, right. I guess I'm just assuming you won't have to keep taking litigation reserves every quarter, but I guess we'll have to wait for that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Exactly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">A couple of quick questions. One, just, first of all, John, in terms of the recent data we've heard coming out of Asia and China, specifically in terms of the potential slowing of growth there, has that presented you any concerns about some of your expectations for revenue and revenue or loan growth coming out of your Asian platform?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Well, let me answer that this way. One is that when you look at these economies, there is still substantial amount of growth. Even if the growth possibilities could be a little bit less than what they might have been, these are significant growing -- significantly growing countries. They're also countries that don't have the same consumer market penetration and consumer loan penetration as we do in the U.S., so there is a secular aspect to this as well. And then the kind of clientele we serve is a clientele that is well inside that growth -- that secular growth aspect as well. And so a lot of what we're seeing is really driven by what's happening in the markets. For example, in the investment sales area, Europe has an impact on whether or not you see the right kind of robust investment sales. On the other hand, on the loan growth side, we still continue to see from the kind of people, kind of customers that we have as clients, a good amount of loan demand.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay. And then just, John, a quick one on the home equity reclassification. It appears that just given the numbers in the supplement that most of that, about 2/3 of that, was in Holdings. Is that correct?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Actually the entirety of the 840 that we moved in on accrual was all in Holdings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Your next question comes from the line of Todd Hagerman of Sterne Agee.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee &amp; Leach Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">John, just a couple of quick ones. Not to beat to death the expense question, but it just was interesting or I found it curious that really across the board your numbers were quite a bit lower than what we've seen or did see in 2011, whether it's the legal, the cost saves or the incremental investment spend. So with your outlook for the year, I mean, how should we think about just the trend? It seems to me that given the numbers this quarter, it's more of kind of back-end loaded, if you will.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I think you would say it's slightly back-end loaded in order to get there. And if you go back to what we had said going into the year, we had said that the heaviest amount of incremental investment spending was behind us, and so that is clearly the case. But what continues is our continued refocus on driving those efficiency saves out of each of the businesses. So we will get somewhere between 3% and 5% efficiency saves out of each of the businesses. So that level of roughly $600 million or so of efficiency saves that we produced in the first quarter should be sustainable throughout the year, and what you should see as the year progresses would be less growth in the investment build.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee &amp; Leach Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay. Because, again, I mean it dropped off to $600 million this quarter. I think last quarter it was nearly $2 billion. And just the delta...</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">No, no, no. The $1.9 billion that we had, that was for all of last year. That was the reengineering saves, the efficiency saves for all of last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee &amp; Leach Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay. And do I read anything into the fact that you dropped the word episodic on the legal side?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">No, don't. You shouldn't read anything into that at all.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Ultimately, all legal is episodic.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yes, I'm sorry, I didn't go back and see what we had called it in the last time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee &amp; Leach Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I just thought perhaps there was a couple of some of those miscellaneous items that were now behind you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">No.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee &amp; Leach Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay, and then just quickly on the -- between LCL and the Special Asset Pool, I think you mentioned like on some of the -- it was the private equity or whatnot just in terms of the marks, could you just remind us what the marks were this quarter, and whether it was in the Special Asset Pool or LCL, how that compared to last quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Any private equity mark that we take will be in the Special Asset Pool because that's where we have the private equity investments. You can see that actually, you can see the private equity investments on one of the schedules that we've got at the back of the earnings deck. It's somewhere on Page 43, 44, somewhere in there. And -- but I'm not going to comment on any specific marks that we've taken.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">A couple of quickies. One on the liquidity, you indicated huge amount of liquidity 26% or so of assets. Could you just give us a sense as to how much you could drive that down if you had all the lending -- high-quality lending that you could do out there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Well, I would say that on a normalized basis, if and when we ever get to a normalized environment, you'd probably have -- that 26% would be something in the high teens, probably -- certainly no more than 20%. So that gives you a range right there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Sure. And that is, in part, going to be a function of the LCL book coming down as well because I'm assuming you're having to hold liquidity against that portfolio. Is that right or no?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Well, we hold liquidity against our entire -- the entirety of our book.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Sure, I'm just -- okay. Then on LCL, are you in process of considering the buy-to-rent program that many others are -- in other words, pooling together some of the properties that you have for sale to private equity or alternatively renting some of the homes that you have right now as per the recent Fed rulings that allowed banks to do that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Well, I don't see us becoming landlords, Betsy. But at the same point in time, you know that the sales of mortgages has been a particular focus of ours. And so you can assume that we will continue to explore various means of taking those mortgages off our books. And if we can find people who would like to buy those mortgages and think that they've got other ways of utilizing the properties, we'll be happy to have those conversations.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And then, lastly, there was an article on the FT today about counterparty exposures, and I think we all know there was some regulation that was put out a while back on how much exposure anybody could have to counterparties and for the larger institutions cap out at 10% of capital. So a suggestion out there today that many of the big 5 are above this 10% limit. Just wondering if that makes sense to you, if there's anything that you're doing to try to either limit that exposure or work with regulators to understand what the impact could be on the industry.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Much more the latter. I mean, let's remember, it's not regulation, it's a proposed rule. So it is not regulation as yet, and so as any proposed rule, the proposed rule comes out and then there is a period where both we and various industry associations comment on it and engage in meaningful dialogue with the regulators so that they -- so we can just make sure that they fully understand some of the impacts of what they're proposing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Your next question comes from the line of David Konrad of KBW.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>David J. Konrad - Keefe, Bruyette, &amp; Woods, Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I just had a follow-up question on FICC given its strength this quarter. I know it's too soon given not everyone's reported results to figure out market share, but can you give us any color on client flow versus marks in the inventory or how -- the bottom line strength for the quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Yes, I'd say that the FICC performance that we had in the first quarter had very good -- had good client flow. Importantly, volumes overall in FICC were probably up on the order of 10%, so we did see incremental volumes in the market, good 2-way flow from clients, so it was a good quarter from a client point of view, not heavily marked by -- or not heavily weighted towards recovery marks in any way. It was good solid performance by the guys in the business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo of CLSA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">On Slide 3, where you have the significant P&amp;L items and you have the expense items related to legal and repositioning, would that be recorded in Corporate/Other?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Not necessarily. We -- most of what we've booked this quarter from a legal and related would be in Corp/Other, but it's not exclusively. It's probably heavily weighted towards Corp/Other, and then the remainder would be in Holdings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">And the repositioning charges last quarter, was that in Corporate/Other?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">No. The repositioning charges would be in the businesses that are actually engaged in the repositioning, so every one of those repositioning charges would be in a business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Okay. So maybe take half of the decline from the fourth quarter to the first quarter in legal, and so maybe it's about $150 million in Corporate/Other?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">No. I was giving you an answer, Michael, on the $545 million itself. Of that $545 million, most of that is in Corp/Other. Last quarter, most of the charge would have been in Holdings as opposed to in Corp/Other.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Okay. What I'm getting to is Slide 16, the Corporate/Other. And you had almost $800 million of expenses, and that was up quite a bit from the fourth quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Exactly. That's because, this quarter, we would have had -- as I said, the bulk of almost $400 million of that $545 million would be in Corp/Other. Whereas last quarter, I can't tell you off the top of my head how much of the $832 million would have been in Corp/Other, but it would have been a very small amount.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">What I'm eventually trying to get to is if you spread the Corporate/Other revenues and expenses over the 3 key areas of Citicorp: Global Consumer, Securities and Banking and Transaction Services, how would the operating metrics look if you were to do that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">It would still look very strong for the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">One last, the ROA as reported in your supplement for Citicorp is 1.25%. And I think if you overlay Corporate/Other to the ROA that you report there, then the ROA goes down to 93 basis points.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">And I think that if you further adjust that for both the asset sales and the CVA/DVA, you come up with a number of like 1.07%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Okay. And then, when you look at that 1.07% versus your target of 1.25% to 1.5%, what areas are underperforming relative to where you eventually want to get?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">I think one of the single largest contributing factors is still the low interest rate environment. When we set the target of 1.25% to 1.50%, I mean let's be fair, we actually had an upper limit on it. We were anticipating an environment where interest rates would be close to 0. So the biggest piece of work that we have yet to do is to get back to a more normal interest rate environment. I think you'll also see the share of our consumer business as a percentage of overall Citicorp, plus Corp/Other, both revenue and net income grow from here out. Then, the consumer businesses, in total, produce much higher ROA type of numbers. So it's not necessarily, at this point in time, that things are underperforming. It's a matter of we need to get some more growth in consumer, which, again, we've laid out as what we're trying to do. And secondly, we need to get back to a more normal interest rate environment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">And then last unrelated, with the EMEA loans are up a little bit, the way I'm looking at it from the fourth quarter, does that make sense to be expanding those loans? And are you simply being opportunistic because others are retreating? Or what's happening there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Michael, I got to tell you, I just -- I don't have an EMEA loan story in my head right now. Maybe if you give John or Susan a call in Investor Relations, they can impact. But don't forget, when we talk about EMEA, EMEA is a much larger region than just western Europe. It includes the Middle East and Africa, as well as eastern Europe. So I'm sure that the growth is probably in those areas. But I just don't have that on the top of my head.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Your next question is a follow-up from the line of Moshe Orenbuch of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">You had mentioned just, and this was news to me, that you were going to resubmit the stress test on March numbers. Aren't your Basel capital numbers kind of up 40 basis points? So I mean, wouldn't that in and of itself just kind of, with the same assumptions both on stresses and on capital, kind of put you 40 basis points higher? Or is there something I'm missing?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Actually, it's 60 basis points. That's the starting point on that. But that's the math. We understand that. Having said that, Moshe, what I said was, there's a possibility we -- and quite a significant possibility, we actually may have to run a real new stress test, and we don't know the scenarios either. And so it's going to be very hard to look at this on a apples-to-apples basis, and frankly I just don't have that information right now to go through it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">There are no further questions at this time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>John Andrews</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Great, thank you. This is John Andrews again. We'd like to thank you for listening today. The call will be available on replay later today on our website.

Today's call will be hosted by Ilene Fiszel Bieler, Head of Fixed Income Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions] Also as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Fiszel Bieler, you may begin.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Ilene Fiszel Bieler</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CFO, John Gerspach will speak first. Then, Eric Aboaf, our Treasurer, will take you through the Fixed Income investor presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we'll be happy to take questions. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results and capital and other financial conditions may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2011 Form 10-K. With that said, let me turn it over to John.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you, Ilene, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased to be hosting our Fixed Income investor review this quarter. Today, we're going to update you on our continued execution and progress in several areas including our liquidity and balance sheet management. Eric Aboaf, our Treasurer, is going to take you through some specifics on our balance sheet progress, our liquidity profile and our capital position, as well as review our recent issuance activity and current funding plans for the coming year. Many of you may have joined us for last Monday's earnings call, and there are some key points from that call that I would like to highlight to start us off here on Slide 1. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">This quarter, we reported net income of $2.9 billion for the first quarter of 2012. x CVA and excluding the net gain from minority investments, we earned $3.4 billion in net income or $1.11 per share. This is a significant increase both from the first and fourth quarters of 2011. While our businesses operated in an improved environment in the first quarter, we also saw the benefit of our investments. We generated revenue growth and had positive operating leverage across Citi's core businesses: Global Consumer Banking, Transaction Services and Securities &amp; Banking. Key drivers such as loans in Citicorp grew by 12% from the prior year, while we deepened client relationships and improved market share in several businesses. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Global Consumer Banking generated $10 billion in revenues in the quarter, up 5% from the previous year. Securities &amp; Banking revenues rebounded, driven by particularly strong performances in Fixed Income. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">In Transaction Services, revenues were a record $2.7 billion, reflecting strong growth, particularly in trade finance, where our unique global footprint gives us a meaningful competitive advantage. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Overall, net income x CVA for our institutional businesses increased 12% compared to the first quarter of 2011, and was 4.5x larger when compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We reduced our legacy assets in Citi Holdings by 7% during the quarter, and Citi Holdings assets are now at $209 billion or just 11% of our total assets. While the operating environment improved in the first quarter, there is still much macro uncertainty, and we'll continue to manage risk carefully. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Now, let me turn to capital and liquidity. First, let me share with you some numbers since we further added to our capital base during the first quarter. We ended the quarter with $122 billion of Tier 1 common capital, and a ratio of 12.4% under Basel I, up from 11.8% at the end of the fourth quarter. And for the first time, we shared our Tier 1 common ratio on a Basel III basis, which stood at an estimated 7.2% at the end of the quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Now keep in mind that Basel III requires the deductions of certain minority holdings on a dollar-for-dollar basis from an institution's capital base, and the 7.2% figure reflects that. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In aggregate, our minority investments in unconsolidated financial institutions such as Akbank and Morgan Stanley Smith Barney amount to 120 basis points of deduction. As you know, we expect to reduce certain of these stakes over time. While we're at 7.2% now, we still expect to exceed 8% by the end of this year and have various paths to do so. In fact, based on current analyst consensus estimates of our earnings for the remainder of 2012 and our anticipated actions, including the reduction of our stake in Akbank, we expect to be above 8% even if Morgan Stanley doesn't exercise its option to buy 14% of the MSSB joint venture this year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">On liquidity, more than 1/4 of our balance sheet is in cash or liquid securities, and even though the Basel III liquidity coverage ratio doesn't come into effect until 2015, we are at an estimated LCR ratio in excess of 125% at quarter end. As a result, we have already exceeded the proposed requirement. As you can see, our capital and liquidity numbers are amongst the strongest in our industry globally. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Turning to Slide 2. I'd like to reemphasize some of our key earnings results from the first quarter. There are a few significant items I'd like to mention that affected our results. First on the revenue side, CVA and DVA were negative $1.3 billion in the first quarter as Citi's credit spreads tightened. And we also benefited from a pretax gain of nearly $500 million related to minority investments. And on the expense side, legal and related expenses remained elevated at over $500 million. However, repositioning charges declined to $66 million from over $400 million in the prior quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Citigroup reported net income of $2.9 billion or $0.95 per diluted share. Excluding CVA/DVA and the minority investment gain, earnings were $3.4 billion or $1.11 per diluted share. Revenues of $19.4 billion were down 2% versus the prior year on a reported basis. However, excluding CVA/DVA and the minority investment gain, revenues were up 1% from last year, as revenue growth in Citicorp outpaced the decline in Citi Holdings. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Expenses of $12.3 billion were roughly flat year-over-year on a reported basis. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation and the significant expense items I just mentioned, operating expenses were up less than 1%. Incremental investment spending was more than offset by efficiency savings. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Credit costs of $3 billion were down 5% versus last year. Net credit losses of $4 billion were down 37% year-over-year, including incremental charge-offs of approximately $370 million in the first quarter related to previously deferred principal balances on modified mortgages. As we discussed in more detail on last week's earnings call, these charge-offs were related to the national mortgage settlement. Excluding these incremental charge-offs, NCLs would have been down 43% from last year. Virtually all of this incremental $370 million of charge-offs was offset by a reserve release specific to the deferred principal amounts. And so the net impact was essentially earnings-neutral. Excluding this specific release, the net reserve release in the first quarter would have been roughly $800 million, down from $3.3 billion in the prior year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Citigroup end-of-period loans were up 2% from last year, to nearly $650 billion. A strong loan growth in Citicorp continued to outpace the wind-down of Citi Holdings, and deposits grew 5% to over $900 billion. And now, let me turn it over to Eric.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"><strong>Eric W. Aboaf</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Thank you, John. While the operating environment improved in the first quarter, we've continued to manage our business and our balance sheet carefully, given the macroeconomic uncertainty. Both our capital and liquidity are robust no matter which measure you use. We have a Basel I Tier 1 common ratio of 12.4%, and a Basel III Tier 1 common estimate of 7.2%, which includes 120 basis point impact from minority investments, certain of which we intend to divest. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We have ample liquidity with $421 billion in aggregate liquidity resources, and our current Basel III LCR estimate up above 125% is comfortably in excess of the 100% proposed minimum. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We continue to make progress in reshaping the balance sheet, which provides us with additional capital and liquidity to strategically deploy in our Citicorp businesses. Year-over-year, our lending growth is up a healthy 12% in Citicorp and 2% in total after taking into account the Holdings wind-down. Our total deposits are up 5%. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We are seeing continued improvement in credit trends, with net credit losses down 37% from a year ago, and we are well reserved with loan loss reserves of $29 billion, or 4.5% of loans. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">And net loan loss reserve releases are down approximately 65% year-over-year, which demonstrates significant improvement in the quality of our earnings this quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">With this strong balance sheet, we have the resources and the capabilities to continue to grow as we help our global clientele navigate the current environment. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Please turn to Slide 4. Let me describe how we are managing our balance sheet for the current environment and investing to grow the Citicorp businesses. On the left, you see assets for Citicorp and Corp/Other, which are up 5% year-over-year as we continue to reinvest in the franchise. Here, you can see how we have deployed our balance sheet to support our customers over the past year in Citicorp. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">For example, net loans, which is our largest asset category, is up approximately $61 billion year-over-year and approximately $8 billion quarter-over-quarter as we continue to lend to both consumer and corporate clients in a disciplined manner. Similarly, we've increased our trading assets by $18 billion quarter-over-quarter and in line with the prior year period in response to customer demand during the improved operating environment we saw in the first quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On the right, you see Citi Holdings assets, which are down 29% year-over-year as the wind-down continues to free up capital. Our Citicorp, Citi Holdings strategy continues to provide us the flexibility to redeploy that capital and take advantage of growth opportunities, particularly in our lending businesses, while also giving us the ability to size our market-making balance sheet to the current economic environment. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to Slide 5. Given our healthier balance sheet, we have been deploying our capital in the Citicorp lending businesses in a disciplined manner, as I just mentioned. So let me describe what we are seeing in loan volumes. In Citicorp, loans grew $514 billion, up 12% year-over-year, including 6% growth in Consumer and 23% growth in Corporate Loans. This quarter's results represented the seventh consecutive quarter of Citicorp loan growth. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In our institutional businesses, lending increased 45% in Transaction Services from the prior year, driven by trade finance lending in Asia, Latin America and Europe. And we saw a 15% growth in our Securities &amp; Banking corporate loan book, which increased borrowing -- with increased borrowing across all client segments and geographies. International Consumer Banking loan volumes increased 8% year-over-year overall, led by growth in Asia and Latin America. These trends reflect the underlying economic growth in these regions, as well as the results of our investment spending, which are driving growth in both cards and retail loans. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">North America consumer loan volumes were up modestly at 4%, driven by retail banking loans as the cards market continues to reflect consumer deleveraging, as well as CARD Act and other regulatory changes. Our overall increase in Citicorp loan volume provides a powerful engine of year-on-year growth in net interest income and accrual earnings. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to Slide 6. Having just discussed our loan trends, let's turn to deposits. This page shows how our deposit base is continuing to grow. Deposits around the world are our primary source of funding in the bank, which I will discuss with you further in a moment. Company-wide, deposits increased 5% or $40 billion year-over-year, and increased to a robust 7% in Citicorp. As I've said before, deposits are one of our lowest cost sources of funds. And you can see that while deposits have grown, the overall cost of funds on deposits is down year-over-year and significantly more from prior periods. This reflects both the low rate environment and our ability to lower price points, which widens our margins given abundant customer liquidity, while still remaining competitive and attracting deposits. We would, however, expect to see some pressure on deposit rates due to competitive pricing in certain regions or when interest rates increase. This quarter, in keeping with our client-focused model, we saw healthy deposit growth across all our deposit-taking businesses, including Consumer Banking, the Private Bank in our Securities &amp; Banking business and in Transaction Services. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to Slide 7. This page shows how we continue to improve the quality of our deposit base. You can see on the page that we have been actively changing the composition of our deposits within both Global Consumer Banking and our institutional businesses, meaning Transaction Services and Securities &amp; Banking. Time deposits, where rates are fixed for the term of the deposit and which have lower margins, are becoming a smaller proportion of our base in both businesses, whereas operating balances are becoming a larger proportion of our deposits. These checking and savings accounts for individuals and cash management accounts for corporations are providing wider margins and have exhibited stickier behavior. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Year-over-year, our deposit mix has shifted positively within each business. Operating balances are now 76% and 73% of the total for the global consumer and our institutional businesses, respectively. On a firm-wide basis, operating balances now represent 74% of our overall Citicorp deposit base, whereas last year, they represented approximately 71%, and 2 years ago, they were at 62%. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On Slide 8, I want to show you how the balance sheet activity that we just reviewed is contributing to our net interest margin. This quarter, we saw NIM remain flat, which is largely due to a few offsetting factors. As I mentioned, we rebuilt our trading book after the fourth quarter decline, and those assets came at lower yields. That offset the NIM tailwind that typically comes as loans become a larger proportion of our asset base. At the same time, as you have heard me say before, we have been focused on reducing our borrowing costs. In the bank, we have been substituting maturing long-term debt, which is a more expensive source of funding, with deposits, our lowest-cost source of funds. This has a positive impact on NIM. And finally, we had a reserve release in Japan consumer finance, which had a positive impact on NIM this quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Looking forward, absent any other significant changes, our NIM will likely continue to reflect the pressure of a low interest rate environment and subsequent changes in our portfolio. As such, we expect we'll probably see a NIM ratio closer to approximately 2.85% next quarter. And after that, we would expect that NIM should be stable or perhaps grow slightly. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Turning to Slide 9. Looking at Citi Holdings, let me describe our progress in reducing the amount of our higher-risk assets in general. Holdings assets have declined by 74% from their peak in 2008 to $209 billion and now stand at just 11% of our balance sheet. The $16 billion reduction in the first quarter was comprised of roughly $4 billion of asset sales and business dispositions, approximately $11 billion of net runoff and paydowns and $1 billion of net cost to credit and net asset marks. This slide shows you the key businesses within Citi Holdings where those reductions occurred. Importantly, the 2 largest components of Citi Holdings, the Special Asset Pool and Local Consumer Lending, are down 51% and 24%, respectively, from the first quarter of 2011. And as I've said before, our Local Consumer Lending U.S. Mortgage business is a fraction of the size of that of our large U.S. bank peers. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Clearly, we are continuing to make significant progress executing on our Citi Holdings asset reduction strategy. And as we have stated, we believe the pace of reductions will continue at approximately this rate. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Given the interest in GIIPS countries, we wanted to update you on our exposures on Page 10. At the end of the first quarter, Citi's gross funded credit exposure to GIIPS was $20.5 billion, roughly flat to last quarter. Netted against our gross funded credit exposure, we have margin posted under legally enforceable margin agreements, collateral pledged under bankruptcy-remote structures and purchased credit protection from financial institutions predominantly outside of these 5 countries. These amounts totaled $14.5 billion. So net of this margin, collateral and purchase credit protection, our net current funded exposure to GIIPS at the end of the first quarter was $9.1 billion. This was up a bit from the $7.7 billion last quarter due primarily to normal fluctuations in the trading book, while the banking book itself was down slightly. You can also see that the majority of our exposure in these countries is to corporate, not to the sovereign itself. We continue to carefully manage these exposures while serving our important clients in these countries. Importantly, since the end of the second quarter of 2011, we have decreased our net current funded GIIPS credit exposure by 1/2, down 50% from $11.9 billion to $6 billion. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Now moving to Slide 11. Having discussed balance sheet trends in some detail, now let's review Citi's liquidity and funding strategy, which has been a cornerstone of strength. Our current strategy is designed to provide ample high-quality liquidity to make sure that we are well positioned to grow our core business and navigate various market conditions. In both the bank and nonbank, we carry a healthy liquidity buffer, which is generally held in cash and highly liquid securities, such has treasuries and agencies and other G7 instruments. We execute on this funding strategy in both our bank and nonbank businesses by accessing a spectrum of funding sources. In our bank businesses, our funding is primarily in the form of stable, diversified deposits from around the world, which I discussed earlier. In our nonbank businesses, we use a modest amount of short-term funding such as repo to finance liquid assets. We then use a range of long-term debt instruments to cover our broader business needs. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Our funding strategy has served us well over the last few years and has prepared us easily to meet the proposed Basel III liquidity requirements as we show on Slide 12. The Basel III liquidity coverage ratio or LCR is designed to ensure banks maintain adequate level of unencumbered cash and highly liquid securities that can be converted to cash to meet liquidity needs under an acute 30-day stress scenario. As you are aware, the proposed minimum requirement for the LCR is 100%. The Basel committee recently disclosed results from its quantitative impact study exercise, which was conducted in the second quarter of 2011. The average LCR for all large Group 1 banks was 90%, while the European large bank average was 71%. While we are still awaiting final guidance on the Basel III liquidity coverage ratio, we believe that we are already comfortably in compliance given the current rules as we understand them, and we are running an estimated LCR ratio above 125%. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Given that the industry average is below the proposed minimum requirement, it appears certain banks will need to reposition themselves in order to achieve compliance with the LCR minimum. In this repositioning will likely take the form of issuing more long-term debt to close liquidity gaps, selling less liquid securities inventory and replacing them with government and agency securities, and in raising additional customer deposits or reducing customer lending. Since Citi's current LCR estimate is more than 25% above the proposed minimum, we believe we will be able to avoid any potential repositioning costs I just outlined. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Part of the reason we scored well on the Basel III LCR is the size of our liquidity buffer, which is defined as cash and highly liquid securities on Slide 13. It stood at approximately $421 billion at the end of the first quarter. This quarter, our high-level bank liquidity is up as deposits have increased. At the same time, our nonbank liquidity to support our parent and broker-dealer activities decreased slightly. We continue to believe that this range is proportionally calibrated to the size of our balance sheet and current market conditions. In addition, as of the first quarter, we currently estimate that other entities and subsidiaries held approximately $93 billion of cash and unencumbered liquid securities. When you include this additional liquidity, our total liquidity buffer is approximately $421 billion. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">And finally, it is also worth mentioning that we only include our on-balance sheet liquidity buffer here. As such, we don't include borrowing capacity at the Fed discount window or international central banks or with the FHLB as part of our aggregate liquidity resources. That capacity is over and above what you see on this page. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Turning to Slide 14, let me describe for you the current status of our ratings, a topic we have discussed quite a bit over the last 1.5 years. As you are aware, S&amp;P and Fitch resolved their industry-wide reviews in the fourth quarter of 2011 and announced their rating changes at that time. You may recall that during this previous rating action, we estimated that less than 1% of our funding could be impacted, and the actual impact was far less and was not material. We are rated A, A-1 with S&amp;P at our key operating entities, Citibank, N.A.; CGMI and CGML ; and A-, A-2 at the Citigroup holding company. Also, we are rated A, F1 with Fitch at both the operating and holding company levels. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">As you are also aware, on February 15 of this year, Moody's announced an industry-wide review and placed 17 global banks and securities firms on review for downgrade, along with many more local banks around the world. As you can imagine, we have been in active dialogue with Moody's during the review time period and have been discussing Citi's strong capital and liquidity position, ever-improving asset quality and overall franchise strength. We have also discussed our relative standing and strength as compared with the other U.S. and European banks on review. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Now given this potential action, we have carefully thought through the potential impacts. In this context, we are often asked about funding requirements related to derivatives. As we have disclosed in our filings previously, in the event of a downgrade, Citi may have to post additional funding in the form of cash obligations and collateral. Specifically, in the event of a 2-notch downgrade by Moody's, Citi could be required to post additional funding in the form of cash obligations and collateral of up to approximately $2 billion. This is a subset of what we shared with you in the 10-K, which represented a 2-notch downgrade across all 3 agencies at once. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Further, in terms of the derivatives business, that activity is predominantly conducted on the bank today, and we do not believe that a downgrade to the A3 level will have a material impact as this remains above the counterparty threshold for the vast majority of our clients. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">In general, these are very small numbers in the context of our $1.9 trillion balance sheet, as well as when compared to our liquidity buffer, which as we just discussed is more than $420 billion. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Turning to Slide 15, I wanted to take a moment to talk about what we have been hearing and seeing from our clients and investors regarding credit assessments and how that's changed over the years. In the past, when information was limited and infrequent, ratings often served as the only available measure of creditworthiness. This suited an era of smaller, simpler banks with limited disclosures, as well as a nascent investor marketplace. Today, investors and clients have become increasingly sophisticated and are typically assessing banks in multiple indicators rather than solely relying on ratings from 2 agencies, no less a single agency. In fact, investors and clients are looking for an investing edge and have effectively built internal teams to take on the credit-assessment process. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">In contrast to the past, clients and counterparties today are looking at a variety of metrics to assess bank creditworthiness. These measures include financial metrics, which is a bank's equity base, regulatory capital levels, liquidity profile and loan loss reserve. Market metrics, which are available in realtime, such as bonds and CDS spreads and stock prices, are also being included in valuations. And finally, business metrics, such as business strategy, geographic diversification and risk concentrations, are also key drivers of the assessment process for today's complex multinational banks. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">We believe this shift to a more integrated approach to credit evaluations is appropriate in an increasingly complex market environment and have expanded our disclosures accordingly. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">In keeping with our discussion of the changing market environment, Citi has significantly shifted its funding mix over the last 2 years away from short-term sources to deposits and long-term debt and equity. Slide 16 shows the funding composition that we have for the bank and nonbank. Within our bank, we believe our deposit base is one of the most stable and lowest-cost funding source. And you can see that approximately 80% of our bank is funded by deposits compared to 72% in the first quarter of 2010. In the nonbank businesses, long-term debt represents the most significant component of our liability mix. The vast majority of this funding is comprised of senior term debt along with subordinate instruments and trust-preferred securities. As of the first quarter, long-term debt comprised 35% of the funding in the nonbank. While long-term debt was lower over the course of the past year, so is the levels of assets, especially illiquid assets it is meant to support. Approximately 30% of our nonbank liabilities are secured financings, often referred to as repos, which provide funding in a carefully calibrated manner for liquid securities at modest haircut. And finally, our large base of book equity supports both the bank and nonbank entities. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">On Slide 17, let me turn to long-term funding and our liability management initiatives. The top half of the page shows our long-term debt outstanding by category over time, including senior debt, TLGP and credit card securitizations. The bottom half of the page segments the amount of long-term debt in the bank and nonbank entities. So the bottom is just another cut of the top to provide you with some further texture. As you can see here, our long-term debt outstanding has decreased year-over-year in most long-term debt categories as we have deleveraged the balance sheet, especially in the bank. In the bank, we have consciously reduced debt funding as we have grown our deposit base. Looking at the nonbank at the bottom half of the page, longer-term debt has decreased as we have led TLGP roll off, while keeping a healthy amount of funding for our broker-dealer. In the nonbank, assets have been reduced at a corresponding pace, especially as we wound down holdings and took actions to reduce higher-risk and less-liquid Basel III assets in the dealer. As you can see here with our current estimate for the fourth quarter of 2012, we believe that this trend will continue, and expect a decline in the amount of long-term debt that we have outstanding, particularly in the bank. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Turning to Slide 18, let me review with you the liability management strategy that we have been executing over the course of the last few years. As we have discussed on past calls, we have successfully derisked our balance sheet and reduced Holdings assets, thereby creating ample liquidity. Through selective public tender offers and open market purchases, we have reduced outstanding debt, both short and long term, with either excess cash or by replacing it with new issued debt at lower spreads. The chart on the left-hand side of this page shows our quarterly liability management activity in the nonbank. As you can see, we've been consistently active in the senior benchmark and structured space. This quarter, our buybacks at structured and benchmark paper allowed us to lower our overall funding costs. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">On the right-hand side of this page, you can see that we carefully managed the weighted average maturity of our long-term debt. Over the last year, WAM increased to approximately 7 years from 6.2 years in 2010. On the bank, we have consciously allowed TLGP to run off as we have replaced it with stable deposit funding. You can see at the end of last year, with TLGP rolling down, we no longer have unsecured benchmark debt with maturity greater than one year in the bank. On the dealer nonbank, we've used our liability management efforts, coupled with our issuance strategy, to consciously maintain the maturity of our debt. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Moving onto Slide 19, you can see our expected maturities for the full year 2012 and also our expected maturities of long-term debt over the next 2 years. This chart fully shows how maturities peak in 2012 and come down in 2013. As we see in light blue at the top of the first column, TLGP debt represents the bulk of the maturities in 2012. Many observers have noted that this wave of maturities is an industry-wide situation which came about as many banks issued TLGP and other government-guaranteed debt in 2008 and 2009. As I've said before, for us at Citi, we do not expect to replace TLGP maturities. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">As we have demonstrated and reviewed on prior slides, the reason is clear. As we continue to reduce our Citi Holdings balance sheet in both our bank and nonbank entities, our need for long-term debt is coming down. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">During the first quarter, we issued approximately $7 billion in long-term structured -- structural debt. We issued across multiple tenders in both benchmark and structured notes. As we stated last quarter, we continue to expect to issue approximately $15 billion to $20 billion of long-term debt during 2012, although this number may change based on market conditions or other factors. At this time, we believe we will be at the low end of this range, and the balance of our issuance program will be a mix of benchmark and structured debt. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Moving onto Slide 20. As many of you know, as part of the CCAR process, Citi received approval to redeem certain series of outstanding trust preferred securities. Let's take a moment to review the securities that we have outstanding. You can see on the bar charts below that we have grouped our outstanding trust preferreds into 2 categories based on their call features, those that are currently callable and those that are not currently callable but we believe would be callable under a regulatory capital event. These securities are ordered in each category by coupon, and the smaller bar shows the notional amount of bridge security as well. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Many of you have asked about our current strategy with regard to our trust preferred securities given the regulatory changes pending under Dodd-Frank and Basel III. For the issues that are not callable now, we would be at -- but would be at the time of regulatory capital event, we, along with many others in the industry, are awaiting the expected forthcoming NPR from the regulators. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">In general, we will consider various factors when evaluating each of our trust preferred and enhanced trust preferred securities, including aspects such as coupon, currency and the optional and regulatory call features of the securities I've just reviewed and the timing of such options. You can expect that Citi will make the appropriate economic decision. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So turning to Slide 21, let me talk about capital, which continues to be an area of significant strength for us and supports the lending growth that I described. Our Basel I Tier 1 common capital stands at $122 billion, and our Basel I total capital is $172 billion. At the end of the first quarter, our Basel I Tier 1 common ratio was 12.4%, significantly up from a year ago and also up from the fourth quarter. Our risk-weighted assets stand at $978 billion and Citi Holdings risk-weighted assets now represent approximately 19% of the total. And as I mentioned earlier, our Basel III Tier 1 common estimate was 7.2% at the end of the first quarter, and we still expect to exceed 8% Tier 1 common under Basel III by the end of this year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">As you can see, our capital base is one of the strongest in the industry, both as compared to U.S. and international banking peers. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Moving to our last slide. Let me summarize 4 major points. First, as I've said, our capital base continues to be one of the strongest in the industry, and this is reflected across every one of our significant capital ratios. Second, we have significantly improved our structural liquidity by increasing our capital base and deposits, and reducing Citi Holdings assets. We believe that we have ample liquidity and our estimated Basel III LCR is over 125%, which is significantly above the estimated industry average and the proposed required minimum. Third, we will have a significantly lower proportion of wholesale funding going forward. We currently have modest long-term debt issuance plans over the next year. We will not be replacing the maturing TLGP debt. Thus, we expect that our long-term debt outstanding will continue to decline. And fourth, while the environment remains uncertain, we saw continued strength in our core lending and deposit-taking businesses, as well as in our market businesses this quarter. As we stated earlier, we achieved positive operating leverage again in our Asian and Latin American Consumer Banking businesses this quarter, and Transaction Services achieved positive operating leverage as well. That concludes our Fixed Income review. John and I will be happy to take your questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p9\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Ryan O'Connell with Morgan Stanley Investment Management.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Ryan O'Connell</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Two questions, if I could. One, thanks for all the detail on the possible impact of the Moody's downgrade. What I'd like to zero in on is the preparations you've made with respect to your repo funding base. I take your point very much that people are not going to be just following Moody's blindly, but as you know, some 2a-7 funds and all that are limited to what they can do. Assuming that Moody's makes a mistake and would take the rating down to Prime-2. So could you talk a bit about what you've done to maybe diversify the counterparties in your investor base there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Eric W. Aboaf</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Sure, Ryan. It's Eric here. We've done several things that are relevant to the repo base, but first, I've got to remind you that the preponderance of our repo activity is handled on the dealer, which is part of the Citigroup chain, and thus, has a different set of ratings than the bank and in fact, already has a P2 rating by Moody's. That's important because that investor group, right, the repo counterparties, have already dealt with the potential situation. And as you know, Moody's has reaffirmed our P2 short-term rating on the -- at the Citigroup and dealer level. That said, we've done several things over the past couple of years on repo to ensure that it is carefully calibrated. And that includes kind of the following list. I think, number one, we have significantly lengthened the tenor of the repo base. Historically, repo had been done on a multi-week, one month basis, and we significantly lengthened the tenor across Fixed Income repo, Equity repo, to make sure that it is a robust and dependable source. Secondly, we've diversified the client base. We had gone through an assessment probably over 2 years ago to identify which counterparties were more sensitive, less sensitive to ratings and we adjusted that mix, so that it would be robust source regardless of what might change in the external environment. And third, we actually specifically put in place very tight limits on any sensitive counterparties like the 2a-7 funds. And I think I've told you before, those funds against the repo base that we have are really a low single-digit portion of our funding today.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Ryan O'Connell</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay, that's very helpful. And the next question really has to do actually with the operating business. And that is with Securities &amp; Banking. If we look at the geographical mix, North American revenues year-over-year, this is year-over-year, North American revenues were down about 17%, whereas EMEA was up about 16%. Now I know it's true that, I mean, FICC was up a lot. Equity was [indiscernible], but Equity was down a lot. Is it that just one business is more FICC-centric than the other? Is that what's driving the difference between the U.S. revenue trends and the EMEA ones?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">It is a little hard when you get into the -- this is John, Ryan. When you look at the geographic split, there's a lot that goes into that. A lot of our G10 Rates business is conducted actually out of Europe. G10 Rates had a very strong quarter in the first quarter, so you might see a little bit more growth than in Europe. And some of our more credit-sensitive businesses are done more out of North America. And as I think we indicated last year, we had repositioned some of those businesses to be more in line with the Basel III environment, and therefore, had actually reduced the balance sheet that we had devoted to those businesses. So I think that is more what you're seeing in those revenue figures -- when you try to compare the geographies.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Now we'll hear from Robert Smalley with UBS.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Robert Smalley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">A couple of quick questions. I'm going on the supplement here that you put out last week, and I'm looking in the liability section on Page 4. I want to continue the conversation on deposits. I see that from last year to this year, most of the growth in deposits -- there was a lot of growth in deposits in noninterest-bearing deposits in the U.S. offices. I'm guessing that that's a continuation of something that we spoken about before, the unlimited FDIC coverage for transaction and non-interest-bearing accounts that ends at the end of this year. How are you looking at that going forward? And how are you going to keep that money in the bank?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Eric W. Aboaf</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Robert, it's Eric. Let me take that one. I think the first context I'd give you is that we have deposit insurance programs not only in the U.S., but around the world. And so this is one of many sources of funds for us. Secondly, we are not actively and we've never really actively marketed an insurance-protected deposit account as a lead product. And you can imagine why. Because of exactly the risk that you've raised. If you suddenly add a lot of those deposits and then something changes, you're open to risk. And so we've not actually done that. What we've done is literally just continued to build our deposit base. We've done it in a balanced way. And what you'll notice is most of those non-interest-bearing deposit accounts were actually in operating balances, right, which are the stickier and more reliable deposit balances. And thus, we have a fair amount of confidence that while there may be some changes that come and go in the insurance program, we don't expect much of a change as that happens.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Robert Smalley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. And I see that on the deposits outside the U.S., that's fairly flat over the period. Is that something that you expect to grow? Are you picking up share from, say, European banks that are leaving emerging markets? And is that a push for you? And furthermore, can we see more kind of self-funding of those type of entities going forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Eric W. Aboaf</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Robert, it's Eric, good questions. I think we are seeing some inflows of deposits as customers and corporates and different clients of various types are evaluating their various banks and clearly see us as a very healthy and strong bank, and part of a flight-to-quality as they look at some of the dislocations in Europe or in other parts of the world. I think what we have continued to do is carefully calibrate the pricing on deposits to make sure that we're not pricing up. In fact, I think we've consciously let pricing flow downwards because really, we're not in the business of raising large amounts of time deposits or discretionary deposits. What we really try to accomplish within our Transaction Services business, in particular, is a cash management-type of program, which has local cash management, international cash management, custodial or clearing operations. And deposits just happened to be a productive byproduct of that activity, which really makes them, in the end, a fairly low-cost and sticky funding source for us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Robert Smalley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. But we won't look forward to you gathering more deposits or even issuing longer -- medium- and longer-term debt out of these type of entities, like an HSBC or Santander?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Eric W. Aboaf</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">No. Let me put that differently. We're not expecting to issue much long-term debt in the bank entities, specifically because we are rich in the deposit-liability source. What we are doing, and we've always done, is actually had a very balanced balance sheet with regards to deposits relative to loans in every one of our entities. In fact, you can imagine we run 100 entities plus around the world. Every one of those is run at a very high standard of liquidity. It's not as if we ask one entity or one country to fund another, because that would not make for a robust local franchise. And as you know, we run a global franchise that is -- across our businesses, but every one of those also is run on a local basis, and that's really been done that way for many years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Robert Smalley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. One more, if I could sneak it in, on Page 20 on the TruPS. The graph here implies that you may have approval to, depending on the NPR, but you got approval from the CCAR process to redeem all of these. Is that the case or is there a certain dollar hurdle that you got approval for?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Eric W. Aboaf</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Robert, it's Eric again. We got -- we did not get -- we did not ask and did not get approval for redeeming all of our TruPS. As you know, we need some of the TruPS as part of the Tier 1 requirements, and they don't phase out until by year, starting in 2013 and going for 5 years hence. So we need some of these. What I can tell you is that we got approval to redeem a substantial amount. We're not at liberty to say, because that's obviously part of the discussions that we've had with the Fed, but I can tell you that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Robert Smalley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. So you can't elaborate on what a substantial amount would be?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Eric W. Aboaf</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Not at this point. I mean as soon as we see more -- as soon as we see an NPR and have a regulatory call then, then we could actually act in the market and disclose which we would like to and have gotten approval to call. But at this point, just given the obvious confidentiality requirements of the CCAR process, we can't elaborate further.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And now we'll go to David Knutson with Legal &amp; General.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David Knutson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Got a couple of questions, one on Moody's. Is there any sense that after this review is completed, will Moody's continue to have a negative outlook regarding Citi's credit or do you anticipate a stable outlook?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Eric W. Aboaf</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">David, it's Eric. I really don't know and it's probably best place to ask them. They're re-rating the entire global banking industry, right, country by country, as well as the large banks, and probably best that you just ask them directly about that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David Knutson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes. And then on the long-term debt issuance plan, it's 15 to 20 for '12. So you've done 7, so really the amount is 15 to 20 minus the 7, just to clarify it, right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Eric W. Aboaf</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes, that's correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David Knutson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And then the economic basis that you talked about regarding the TruP redemption, is the right way to think about the economic evaluation of it, if you have a TruP which has less regulatory capital, therefore, it starts to look like senior debt, should we consider when we're thinking or trying to understand your perception of the economic value or the economy trade-off here, should we look at the TruP cost relative to an equivalent senior debt cost, perhaps a short day of senior or a longer day of senior? Maybe you could describe a little bit more what is the economic valuation perspective you have with regards to your TruPs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Eric W. Aboaf</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">David, it's Eric. I think that's a good construct and in the direction of how we approach it. These trust preferreds will become, in effect, senior debt as they have less and less capital content. And so we literally need to compare the borrowing costs of new issued debt or existing debt with these trust preferred coupons and just make an economic decision between the 2. Do we think about it as the equivalent of a short 1- and 2-year debt? No. I think you really need to compare this to medium-term and benchmark debt issuance costs, and then we do the analysis from there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>David Knutson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And then one last question. With the news regarding Argentina and YPF, has this -- does this impact any of your international development or growth plans with this x appropriation?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Eric W. Aboaf</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">David, we've always been very careful around the emerging markets. And as you know, we've been operating the emerging markets for hundreds of years. We've been through governments and government changes in Latin America, in Argentina specifically, but in every part of the world. And you can imagine, we have a pretty elaborate playbook on how to operate in these kinds of environments that change and could change in different ways. That said, the balance sheet is quite healthy in Argentina. It's been a good country for us but not a particularly high-growth country for us. And we've not seen any balance sheet changes over the last couple of weeks or a month that give us any concern at this point. But it's obviously one that we're very careful about and are actively watching and managing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>David Knutson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes. And there was -- one last thing. The capital action plan that you're seeking, the $8 billion, when I think about the overall projected capital that Citi will have relative to the other large integrated banks in the U.S., it seems to be a bit aggressive. So I guess I'm curious, the view regarding the unsecured credit ratings of the firm. What is the value of being at the upper band of your peers? And when I say your peers, I'm saying the other large integrated U.S. banks. And is it -- do you find that you would have significant value -- is there significant value from an issuance perspective to be in the upper band? Or is where you're at a way to operate healthy in the future?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">David, it's John. I just want to make sure that I understand your use of the term upper band. Which upper band are you talking about? The upper band of...</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>David Knutson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Well, you could say JPMorgan is probably in the -- at the top of the ratings relative to, I think, your peers. So is there...</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">You're looking at it from a rating agency point of view.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>David Knutson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">That's correct, yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. And that's exactly what we're in discussion with Moody's about right now. And that's exactly what we discussed with all the rating agencies and trying to understand how they actually determine their ratings. And as we determine how they actually produce these ratings, then we get the ability then to make decisions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>David Knutson</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So the business can operate efficiently given the ratings that you have now or is that something that you would hope to migrate up towards the top of the -- your peer group?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Well, we would like to be rated higher than we are. We think that the underlying fundamentals that we exhibit today are actually deserving of higher ratings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And now we'll open the floor up to Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Just a couple of bigger-picture questions, perhaps. Eric, you spent some time on Citi's strength in terms of the liquidity coverage ratio and made the obvious point that you all sit above the 100% number and above many of your domestic and international peers. There was some concern when the LCR was first announced that, that would have a very negative or upward bias to corporate loan pricing. And I'm just curious if that's been the case so far. We haven't heard a lot of commentary about it, so I just wonder if that issue has -- was a little overhyped when the LCR first came out.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Eric W. Aboaf</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Matt, it's Eric. The LCR, I think, by and large, is designed thoughtfully by our regulatory agencies, right? We have had discussions -- the industry has had discussions with them about refining the LCR. One of the discussions I think are less around corporate loans themselves, but more about the treatment of corporate deposits and the runoff rates that they assume. If that's what you're referring to, I think those discussions are ongoing. We'll see how the agencies -- what agency -- what the decisions the agencies make, and obviously, we'll operate on that basis. And if that has some impact on our willingness as an industry to pay different amounts on corporate deposits versus retail deposits, I think we're going to have to see that as it plays out. It's very hard to predict it, but certainly, folks have surmised that, that could very well change on the margin some of the pricing that banks have for deposits.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And Matt, it's John. With regard to your question on corporate loans, I think one of the things that Eric mentioned when he was going over the LCR is that given our current ratio, we don't really need to think in terms of repositioning our portfolio to come into compliance with the LCR. There are many other institutions that have yet to actually reposition their portfolio in order to drive their ratio up higher. What could very well happen as they reposition their portfolios, is that they will jettison corporate debt that they would otherwise carry as part of their investment portfolio today. And it's those types of activities that could then have an impact on corporate debt pricing in the marketplace. So I think Eric is quite right as far as his commentary on the impact of corporate deposits. But the impact, the potential impact on the cost of corporate debt and the impact on corporate issuers is something that I think that we have yet to really see what that impact is. Because we still haven't had general repositioning that's going to be required by the industry.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yes, that's helpful. And if I could, just a question on the TruPs repurchases. You said that you plan to call a substantial amount of the $21-or-so billion that you listed on Slide 20 today. I'm just curious as to in the longer-term, what potential beneficial effect that might have on your net interest margin, given, if I assume, that you replace all those with tenure on secured debt, which is probably an overly simplifying assumption, but if we assume that, it looks like about a 300 basis point benefit in terms of the weighted average coupon on the TruPs versus your tenure on secured debt.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Eric W. Aboaf</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Matt, it's Eric. I think it's a little more complicated than that. Because you actually have to think about our total debt outstanding, right, which I think we showed on one of the pages and has trended towards about $250 billion of debt. That includes these TruPs where -- and on this page, we see about $16 billion of TruPs. And so, yes, there is going to be some optimization between those 2 sources. But I think on a weighted average, it'll be a slight improvement on our net interest margin, our funding cost, and that'll be a benefit to the shareholders of the company. But I don't quite see how you get to the math you did. Maybe we could follow up off-line, if you like.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yes. And the other consideration that has to be brought into the mix is, of course, we still think -- of course, we don't have an NPR, but we still believe that there will be not just the Tier 1 common requirement under Basel III, but also a Tier 1 capital requirement. And if you look at the BIII rules as they're currently drafted, at least in general, there's about another 150 basis points of capital that you need to carry between your Tier 1 common and total Tier 1. So the calling of the TruPs is one thing because the TruPs will no longer count as Tier 1 capital. But yet -- as yet to be determined is what do you need to carry then in order to bridge that extra 150 basis points of Federal requirements.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">David Havens with RBS has our next questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>David Havens</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">As we sort of think about long-term sort of capital planning and regulatory changes and things like the loan loss reserves probably declining because of a, hopefully, a better economy, is there more room for sub-debt in the capital structure down the road?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Eric W. Aboaf</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">It's Eric. That's a very good question, because up until now, most of the discussions among the Basel committee and the regulatory community has been around Tier 1 common capital, which is common equity, which is only common equity. And then Tier 1, which as John just mentioned, will be some type of preferred, although we still need to be -- to get more data about that and more information. What has gone unsaid and is unclear, to be honest, until we get a U.S. NPR or more work is done by the Basel committee is regarding sub-debt and what we generally think of as Tier 2 capital, what will qualify, how much exactly and what are -- are there any subcomponents of sub-debt in Tier 2 capital. And at this point, we have not -- we, I think, as an industry, don't know very much. And so we're obviously going to maintain some of our sub-debt, but we don't have enough information as yet to do that much long-term capital planning for that part of the structure.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>David Havens</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Darn, I was hoping you'd have more information than me on that one. The other question I had, or it's not really a question, I'm just wondering whether you could maybe, as best you can, maybe characterize the discussions that you've had with Moody's from a qualitative perspective. I mean, there -- they seem to be hearing it from all sides, from banks, from investors, that maybe this action that they're considering undertaking is not -- is perhaps not the most accurate representation of bank financial strength at this point in time. And I'm just wondering whether -- from your discussions whether you feel that they're willing to give ground on maybe some of the commentary that they've put out thus far or whether they've kind of put a line on the sand and it is what it is.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">This is John. Moody's obviously prizes their independence, and -- but at the same point in time, they certainly -- they certainly listen to input. But ultimately, they'll be the ones that make their own decisions, and you're really going to have to direct your questions to them.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Now we'll hear from Dave McGowan [ph] with MSSB.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Unknown Analyst</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I'm calling from Morgan Stanley. A couple of questions, guys, first in Securities &amp; Banking. I'm sure there'll be more detail when the Q comes about, but could you talk about what the risk metrics, specifically VAR, look like in the quarter relative to previous quarters?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I think what you're going to see is that the published VAR will actually be down from the prior quarter. I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I do believe that you'll see that the trading VAR is down both year-over-year, as well as down from the fourth quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Unknown Analyst</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">The reserve number you mentioned, that 4.5%, I think you were still higher than -- on reserves to loans than some of your peers. I think the peak was somewhere over 6%. Do you have any view on how low this can go if trends continue?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Well, I think the significant -- when you look at the various disclosures that we've given you, out of the $29 billion worth of loan loss reserves that we have, we allocate $10 billion of those loan loss reserves to our first -- to our mortgage book, both first and the junior liens. And so I think that the answer to your question really is going to be dependent on what happens with the mortgage book at this point in time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Unknown Analyst</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Understood. And then I'll slip in a last quick one. A lot of questions about TruPs and the NPR on what you do there. I presume your financing plan that you've disclosed, the $15 billion to $20 billion, is inclusive of what your expectations are on taking out TruPs?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Eric W. Aboaf</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Dave, Eric. It's Eric here. Yes, that's correct. The financing plans are complete, inclusive of anything we need to do for the TruPs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Hartford Investment Management, John Carolan [ph] has our next questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Unknown Analyst</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I just was wondering if you could share with us to what extent any potential stake sale of Morgan Stanley Smith Barney was incorporated into either your submissions under CCAR or the Fed's analysis of the results in CCAR, given that it represented...</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">John, it's John. The -- don't forget the stress test that the Fed conducted was really conducted on a Basel I basis. And so the investment in the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney joint venture really has very little impact on our Basel I ratios.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Unknown Analyst</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I was under the impression that it also included the path for Basel III compliance though as part of the analysis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">There was a submission, but it wasn't part of the stress test at all.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Unknown Analyst</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So the key driver of the stress test was purely Basel I?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">That's correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Unknown Analyst</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">The next year's stress test, do you envision to continue to be Basel I?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">You'll have to ask the Fed. I'm not trying to be cute. I don't know. I mean, the Fed is the one -- I think in the absence of having an NPR, it would be a little difficult for them to do the stress test on Basel III. But it's...</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Unknown Analyst</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Could it be under Basel II?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Well, we don't even have an NPR on Basel II, do we, from a U.S. point of view?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">We'll move on to Matt Evel [ph] with Aberdeen Asset Management.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Unknown Analyst</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">You have a euro-denominated Tier 2 bond approaching its first core date. I wonder if you can talk through your core policy, especially with respect to observing local market conventions, and any potential consequences of not observing those conventions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Eric W. Aboaf</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Matt, it's Eric. Are you referring to the lower Tier 2 sub-debt as it's referred to in Europe? Is that what you're referring to?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Unknown Analyst</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">That's right, yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Eric W. Aboaf</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. We'll certainly evaluate those as part of our capital structure and funding needs. Clearly, sub-debt performs multiple roles, both as a capital and as debt. And kind of in line with how we think about the TruPs, we have to take an economic view with regard to those issuances. If they're at a certain coupon that, relative to other sorts of debt instruments, then -- that are beneficial to us, we'll have to respect that. And if obviously, they're in a high coupon, we might take a different action. So it really depends on the economic situation of the individual deals.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Unknown Analyst</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. So it's purely on economics. There is no reputational risk or anything like that that comes into the equation at all?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Eric W. Aboaf</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I think there is -- it's hard to talk about reputational risk, I think, in that -- in the way you described. There is reputational risk if we don't take economically rational actions. And so we really need to balance a host of factors.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And Goldman Sachs' Ron Porota [ph] has our next question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Unknown Analyst</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">It's actually Louise [ph] here with Ron [ph]. Actually, our questions have all been answered but I did want to thank you guys again for providing the additional information and for holding the call for Fixed Income. It is really helpful.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Now we'll hear from David Jiang with Prudential.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>David Jiang</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">First question is on Page 19, on the long-term debt issuance. Can you just remind us the different entities that issue long-term debt? And I think it shows in the footnote that you have Citigroup Inc. and CFI as the 2 primary issuers. How do you decide on what -- which entity to issue from? And what is it supporting mostly, is it the broker-dealer?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Eric W. Aboaf</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">David, it's Eric. Let me tackle that and the 2 questions that you've asked. The 2 issuing entities are there in the footnotes as you described. There is Citigroup Inc. and there's Citigroup Funding Inc., so CFI. And the general approach that we have taken and moved to over the last couple of years is to issue benchmark debt out of Citigroup, and the structured debt or structured notes out of CFI just to create good clarity in the investor base as to those types of debt and the issuing entity. That said, what happens is that debt is available to support the activities in the parent, which has some of the old entities like the CitiFinancial entities, and to support the entities of the dealer. And so that debt is then ascribed to different entities, oftentimes on an MIS basis or otherwise, to support those entities, the economics are transfer priced into those entities, and it's done in a way that the major entities that we operate are effectively funded and have the right amounts of liquidity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>David Jiang</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Got you. So the CFI issuance of $1.8 billion is all structured notes?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Eric W. Aboaf</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">It's primarily structured notes, that's correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>David Jiang</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay. Do you have the comparable number that was issued last year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Eric W. Aboaf</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I don't think it's on the slide, but we can see if we can get that for you if you speak with our Fixed Income Investor Relations team.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>David Jiang</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay, great. My second question is on the MSSB joint venture. Was there any OTTI impairment taken on that -- your end? I know it's carried at $10 billion, right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">No. There was no -- There's been no impairment taken on that investment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>David Jiang</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay. Does that impairment test occur every quarter? And I'm asking that in terms of the next tranche of sale or the call option to buy the 14%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">We take a look at the carrying value of that investment every quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>David Jiang</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay. And then the 7.2% Tier 1 common on a Basel III basis, does that take into account the holdings of -- the MSSB Holding?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">That's the full deduction. As we said in some of the opening comments, that 7.2% is net of 120 basis point deduction from our capital base as a result of the various investments that we've got in unconsolidated financial subsidiary -- financial institutions, such as MSSB and Akbank.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>David Jiang</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay, got you. Last question is, regarding the analysis on calling the euro lower Tier 2s. If you choose not to call on the first call date, will you provide a communication to the market?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Eric W. Aboaf</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">It's Eric, David. I'll have to check with the exact process, but let me do that and maybe we can follow up off-line. Certainly, we are -- we prefer to be transparent and very clear about our actions, both the positive actions we take and actions we take not to do something. So we'll do the best we can. But let me just check the exact protocol that we have. One other thing, you did ask about CFI. There is a minority of debt that we issue in CFI that is not structured and also not benchmark-sized, so it's not $750 million or $1 billion deals. It tends to be some of the smaller vanilla deals. And sometimes, we put those in CFI because they have been designed as they -- more as a one-off placement or is a one-off deal. It keeps the benchmark debt very clearly at the Citigroup level in some of the more tailored debt in CFI. So that, you'll see some of those deals as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>David Jiang</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">All right. But that's very small relative?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Eric W. Aboaf</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Yes. It's relatively small, that's correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And our last question comes from Michael Rogers with Conning &amp; Company.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Michael Rogers</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">A bigger-picture question, is it ever conceivable in a post Dodd-Frank world that Citi or any of its top 5, top 4, top 5 competitors could be allowed ever to acquire a large depository in this environment?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Michael, it's John. That's an interesting question. Don't forget when we talk about post Dodd-Frank, we're still in the process of actually trying to implement so much of what is already in Dodd-Frank. I'm not quite sure that it's very clear what a post Dodd-Frank environment is going to look like. But secondly, you're still going to be faced with some of the current rules as far as concentration of deposits in various institutions. And I think that, certainly, in a post Dodd-Frank world, as you put it, that will even -- that's something that people will look at with even more vigor than perhaps they looked at previously.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Michael Rogers</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay. If I could ask a separate question about how concerned are you, gentlemen, about a potential increase in risk coming out of Europe? We've got the French elections to be resolved, I guess, on May 6, it appears there may be some fiscal austerity fatigues setting in not only in maybe France, but in other parts of Europe. Do you believe that the overall risk quotient coming out of Europe in, let's say, the second half or the last 3 quarters of this year, could indeed be poised to increase meaningfully?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">We've been conscious of the risk around Europe for going on 2 years now. And I don't see anything that would cause us to let down our guard as it were regarding Europe. It's a -- it's still very much a situation that needs a lot of work. What we've constantly said is that the Europeans have the ability to handle the situation if they so choose. But this is still an ongoing situation and one that is certainly going to weigh somewhat on the world's economy for a good time yet. So we continue to watch Europe very closely and we manage our risks appropriately.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">That concludes the question-and-answer session. Ms. Fiszel Bieler, do you have any closing remarks?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Ilene Fiszel Bieler</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. If you have any follow-up questions please don't hesitate to reach out to us in Fixed Income Investor Relations. We'll talk to everyone again soon.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference call for today.

Also as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Mr. Andrews, you may begin.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>John Andrews</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Great, thank you very much. Good morning everybody, and thank you for joining us this morning. On the call today, our CEO Vikram Pandit will speak first, then John Gerspach, our CFO will take you through the earnings presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we will be happy to take your questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results and capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today, and those included in our SEC filings, including without limitation the risk factors section of our 2011 Form 10-K.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">With that said, let me turn it over to Vikram.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">John, thank you, and good morning everybody and thank you for joining us today. As you know, we reported earnings of $2.9 billion for the second quarter of 2012, and excluding CVA and the loss from the partial sale of our stake in Akbank, net income were $3.1 billion. That amounts to $1 per share. Overall, I\u2019m pleased with our performance in light of the economic environment we faced during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">The investments we\u2019ve made continue to show encouraging results. Loans and deposits in Citicorp had solid growth. Our market businesses were resilient despite volatility and we increased market share in investment banking.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Revenue in transaction services set another record as we leveraged a unique global footprint, especially in trade finance. While our consumer businesses were impacted by the slower economies, we still saw positive operating leverage in both Latin America and Asia, excluding Japan.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We\u2019re managing our expenses closely, and making sure we\u2019re right sized for the environment we anticipate, expenses decrease from both the first quarter of this year, and second quarter of last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">For the first half of the year, we had positive operating leverages in each of our core businesses. In Securities and Banking, revenues excluding CVA and DVA, increased 2% and expenses decreased 5%. In Transaction Services, revenues increased 6% and expenses increased 2%; and in Global Consumer Banking, revenues increased 2% and expenses increased 1%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">More broadly, we\u2019ve been managing our risk very tightly throughout the organization, Citi Holdings assets are now $191 billion or approximately 10% of our total assets, as we reduced our legacy assets in Citi Holdings by 9% during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Citi remains highly liquid with over $400 billion in cash and government securities, and our capital levels continue to be among the strongest in the industry. As of the end of the second quarter, our Tier 1 common ratio was 12.7% under Basel I, and was an estimated 7.9% under Basel III. We still expect to exceed 8% under Basel III this year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">When you put it all together, we\u2019re generating solid returns in our core businesses. For the combined Citicorp and Corporate/Other, our return on tangible common equity was 14.7% excluding CVA/DVA and Akbank.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">On the same basis for Citigroup, our return on tangible common equity for the quarter was 8.2%. And given the amount of disallowed DTA, the return on Basel III becomes an important measure of capital. On the fully implemented 9.5% basis, our return on Basel III capital in Citigroup was an estimated 10.3%. And our return on Basel III capital on the combined Citicorp Corporate/Other was 18.4% excluding CVA/DVA and Akbank. And while the environment is uncertain, and we continue to optimize our portfolio, we have the capacity to earn similar returns on Basel III going forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">On a macro level, we believe the euro zone overhang will continue. Our on the ground sense of the emerging markets leaves us more positive than we were a few months ago, and maybe even better than some market perceptions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In the U.S. consumer demand and Basel loan demand remain low, as consumers continue to deleverage. And as Federal banks have lowered interest rates, the margin from lending has decreased, and it is expected rates will stay low for the near future.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">That said, our strategy is showing results, and we are executing it diligently. Our focus on capital flows between the world\u2019s top 150 cities on serving multinationals globally, as only we can, and on the faster growing emerging markets are right for the times and the capabilities of our bank. We are diversified and while the negatives will pop-up here and there, our footprint and strategy will serve us well overtime. In short, we\u2019re on top of the things we can control.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">John will now take you through our slides, and then we\u2019ll come back at the end, and take questions together. John?</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Hey, thank you Vikram, and good morning everyone. This part, I\u2019d like to highlight a few significant items affecting our results on slide three. First on the revenue side, CVA and DVA were a positive $219 million in the second quarter. We also recorded a pre-tax loss of $424 million related to the partial sale of our investment in Akbank, compared to a gain on sales of nearly $200 million on HDFC last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">On the expense side, legal and related expenses remained elevated at $480 million, and repositioning charges were $186 million, roughly half of which was related to securities and banking. In addition to these items, our reported results were affected by foreign exchange translation, as the U.S. dollar generally strengthened in the second quarter, against local currencies in which we generate revenues and incur expenses and credit costs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">While FX translation had no material impact on our earnings or regulatory capital ratios, it did affect individual line items, and recorded business drivers, which is why \u2013 I\u2019ll discuss more as we\u2019ll go through the presentation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">On slide four, we show second quarter results. Citigroup reported net income of $2.9 billion or $0.95 per diluted share. Excluding CVA/DVA and the loss on Akbank, earnings were $3.1 billion, or $1 per diluted share. Revenues of $18.6 billion were down 10% versus the prior year on a reported basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Excluding CVA/DVA and the impact of minority investments, revenues were down 7% from last year, as revenue growth in Citicorp was offset by the impact of foreign exchange and the continued decline in Citi Holdings revenues. Expenses of $12.1 billion were 6% lower than the prior year on a reported basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Excluding the impact of foreign exchange and significant expense items, I just mentioned, core operating expenses declined nearly 3%. Credit costs of $2.8 billion were down 17% versus last year. Net credit losses of $3.6 billion were 31% lower than the prior year. And the net reserve release was $984 million down 50% from last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Citigroup end-of-period loans grew 1% year-over-year to $655 billion as continued loan growth in Citicorp outpaced the wind-down of Citi Holdings, and deposits grew 6% to $914 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On slide 5, we show results for Citicorp and Citi Holdings excluding the impact of CVA/DVA. Citicorp generated second quarter revenues of $17.8 billion and net income of $4.2 billion. Year-over-year, Citicorp's reported revenues were flat, and expenses declined 3% and we maintained positive operating leverage in each of our three core businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Excluding FX, Citicorp revenues were 5% higher than last year, and expenses were roughly flat. Pre-provision net revenues in Citicorp were $7.4 billion for the quarter up 5% from last year and for the sixth consecutive quarter, we grew loans year-over-year in every business in Citicorp. Total Citicorp loans grew 10%, with consumer up 2% and corporate loans up 22%. Excluding FX, Citicorp loans grew 13% with consumer up 5%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Citi Holdings had revenues of $903 million and a net loss of $933 million. Citi Holdings ended the quarter with a $191 billion of assets, down $18 billion during the quarter and $74 billion or 28% year-over-year. At quarter end, Citi Holdings accounted for approximately 10% of totaled Citigroup assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On slide 6, we show a nine quarter trend for Citicorp\u2019s result. Excluding CVA/DVA, Citicorp\u2019s revenues of $17.8 billion were flat to the prior year, and down 8% from last quarter on a reported basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Operating expenses of $10.3 billion was 3% lower than the prior year. Citicorp\u2019s net credit losses of $2.2 billion, declined 25% from last year, driven by improvement in North America cards and the net loan loss reserve release in Citicorp was $715 million, down nearly 50% from last year, this reflected lower net releases in North America cards, as well as a net reserve build in international consumer banking, primarily driven by loan growth.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Excluding CVA/DVA, earnings before taxes of $5.9 billion, grew 7% versus last year, driven by lower operating expenses and lower credit losses, partially offset by a lower net reserve release.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On slide seven, we show Citicorp\u2019s pre-tax earnings by business excluding CVA/DVA and the impact of loan loss reserves. As you can see from this chart, our earnings excluding loan loss reserves are increasingly steady and are diversified across the franchise with a growing contribution from consumer and transaction services. On a trailing 12-month basis through the second quarter, consumer banking generated 46% of Citicorp\u2019s earnings, and together with transaction services these businesses represented nearly three quarters of pre-tax profit.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On slide eight, we show Citicorp\u2019s pre-tax earnings excluding CVA/DVA and the impact of loan loss reserves for the first half of the year. On this basis, pre-tax earnings increased by 34% from the first half of 2011 driven by lower net credit losses, as well as an improved operating margin.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Slide nine, shows the results for Citi for North America Consumer Banking. Total revenues of $5.1 billion were up 4% versus last year largely driven by higher gains on sales of mortgage loans. Total card revenues declined 6% year-over-year. In branded cards average loans declined reflecting an increase in the payment rate and spreads remained under pressure due to the continued impact of the look-back provisions of CARD Act and higher promotional balances.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In retail services, net interest revenues were stable while non-interest revenues declined driven by improving credit and its impact on contractual partner payments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Total operating expenses of $2.5 billion were up 5% year-over-year driven entirely by an increase in legal reserves related to interchange litigation. Credit costs declined by over 20% to $760 million. Net credit losses were down 29% to $1.5 billion driven by improvement in cards, and the net reserve release was $814 million this quarter, compared to $1.2 billion in the prior year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Earnings before tax and excluding the impact of loan loss reserves grew to $1.2 billion from $468 million last year. Overall, we continue to see progress in our North America consumer franchise. Average deposits grew for the fifth consecutive quarter, up 5% year-over-year, including double-digit growth in checking account balance. In Branded Cards, accounts also grew for the fifth consecutive quarter, up 5% year-over-year. And for both card portfolios, net credit margin continued to expand year-over-year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to international consumer banking on slide ten; in total, the international consumer businesses achieved positive operating leverage for the third consecutive quarter, with declines in reported revenues and expenses, up 4% and 5% respectively.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In constant dollars, revenues grew 4% and expenses were up 3%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Latin America achieved positive operating leverage for the third consecutive quarter, with revenues up 8% and expenses up 3% in constant dollars. Asia, however, had negative operating leverage with revenues roughly flat and expenses up 2% in constant dollars. Most of revenue pressure in Asia was due to lower investment sales, given continued weak investor sentiment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Cards revenues continued to grow on higher average loans and strong purchase sales. And lending and deposit revenues were flat versus last year as growth in certain market was offset by pressure in Korea and Japan. Korea in particular is being affected by consumer regulatory changes. We show more information on these trends in the appendix.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Despite these headwinds, most drivers for international consumer banking continue to grow in the second quarter. Accounts grew 6% year-over-year, and on a constant dollar basis, we grew average deposits, average loans and purchase sales in every region.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Credit costs were $730 million in the second quarter, up 16% from last year. Within credit costs, net credit losses continue to decline, down 12% to $613 million. However, we recorded a net reserve build of $86 million in the second quarter, principally due to portfolio growth versus a net release in the prior year. Earnings before tax, excluding the impact of loan loss reserves grew 3% year-over-year to $1.1 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On slide 11, we show growth trends for international consumer banking in more detail. On a constant dollar basis, average loans grew 10% over the prior year, and average deposits were up 1%, including 7% growth in checking account balances. Card purchase sales grew 10%. As reported, on a trailing 12-month basis, we have grown pre-tax earnings excluding the impact of loan loss reserve each quarter for well over two years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Slide 12 shows our securities and banking business, excluding CVA/DVA, revenues of $5.2 billion were down 2% from last year, and down 22% versus the prior quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Investment banking revenues of $854 million were down 21% from the prior year on lower underwriting activity, and generally flat sequentially as growth in M&amp;A and equity underwriting offset lower debt underwriting revenue. Overall, our wallet share in investment banking has improved year-to-date in all major products. Ex-CVA/DVA, equity market revenues of $550 million were down 29% from the prior year, and 39% sequentially on lower market activity in both cash and derivatives.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Fixed-income market revenues again ex-CVA/DVA of $2.8 billion were down 4% year-over-year, and down 41% sequentially from a strong first quarter. Year-over-year, revenues in rates and currencies grew at a double-digit pace, driven by particularly strong performance in our foreign exchange and local market businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Credit and securitized products were down year-over-year due to weaker market conditions. Lending revenues of $608 million were up significantly versus prior periods. Year-over-year, loan growth and improved spread drove higher net interest revenues, and we have $42 million of gains on lending hedges this quarter compared to a loss of $85 million last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Total operating expenses of $3.6 billion were down 8% from last year driven by efficiency savings and lower incentive compensation, partially offset by nearly $100 million of repositioning cost. Net income, excluding CVA/DVA, grew 16% year-over-year to $1.3 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Moving to Transaction Services on slide 13; revenues of $2.8 billion were up 5% from last year, as growth in Treasury and Trade Solutions more than offset the decline in Securities and Fund Services. Treasury and Trade Solutions was up 9%, driven by strong growth in deposits and trade loans. Securities and Fund Services was down 6% year-over-year on lower market volumes. However, revenues did show an increase sequentially. The drivers for Transaction Services continued to show strong momentum.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">End-of-period trade loans were up over 50% from the prior year, and average deposits were up 8%. Expenses of $1.4 billion were flat versus last year, and incremental investment spending was of offset by efficiency savings. We achieved positive operating leverage in Transaction Services for the second consecutive quarter, driving 6% earnings growth year-over-year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On slide 14, we show a nine quarter trend for Citi Holding. Citi Holdings reported loss was $920 million in the second quarter. Revenues excluding CVA/DVA were down over 62% year-over-year to $903 million, due primarily to overall lower assets as well as the absence of gains on the sale of held-to-maturity securities and other assets in the second quarter of last year. Operating expenses of $1.2 billion were down 25% versus last year. And total credit costs were down 31% to $1.2 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Looking at Citi Holdings in more detail on slide 15, revenues in brokerage and asset management were $87 million this quarter versus $47 million last year driven by our higher contribution from the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney joint venture.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">In local consumer lending, revenues were down 31% versus last year to $931 million, primarily due to declining loan balances. In the special asset pool, revenues ex-CVA/DVA were negative $115 million in the second quarter compared to a positive $1 billion last year. Net interest revenue was negative $77 million as interest earning assets remained of smaller portion of the special asset pool.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Non-interest revenue excluding CVA/DVA was negative $38 million compared to a positive $1.1 billion last year, which included the significant gains on the sale of held-to-maturity securities and other assets. We also booked $85 million of reverses related to private label mortgage securitizations in the second quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Citi Holdings operating expenses were down 25% year-over-year to $1.2 billion mainly due to declining assets as well as lower legal and related costs. Credit costs were down 31% year-over-year to $1.2 billion. Total net credit losses were down 39% to $1.3 billion reflecting a significant reduction in loans and the special asset pool as well as a declining loan balance and improved credit trends in local consumer lending. We released $269 million of net loan loss reserves in Citi Holding compared to $583 million last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Slide 16 shows Citi Holdings Assets. We ended the quarter with a $191 billion in Citi Holdings were roughly 10% of total Citigroup assets. The $18 billion reduction in the second quarter included roughly a $11 billion of sales approximately $6 billion of net runoff and pay-downs and $1 billion of net credit and net asset marks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Slide 17 shows the results for Corporate/Other. Revenues of negative $265 million were down from the prior year, driven by the $424 million pre-tax loss on the partial sale of Akbank compared to a gain of nearly $200 million on the partial sale of HDFC last year. Expenses of $597 million were down 3% versus last year, mainly due to lower, legal and related expenses. Assets of $289 billion included approximately a $101 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $135 billion of liquid available for sale securities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Turning to total Citigroup expenses on Slide 18. Total operating expenses up $12.1 billion in the second quarter were 6% lower than last year. While core operating expenses, excluding legal and related costs and repositioning charges decline nearly 3% in constant dollars to a $11.5 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">As I mentioned earlier, legal and related costs remained elevated through the second quarter, and we also incurred nearly $200 million of repositioning costs. However, we also benefited from FX translation as the U.S. dollar strengthened in many markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">In total, for the first half of 2012, we reported expenses of $24.5 billion. As we look to the third and fourth quarters, we currently believe that our core operating expenses should be roughly at or below the $11.5 billion we incurred in the second quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Additionally, however, we will continue to incur legal and related costs and repositioning charges, which on a combined basis have exceeded what we would otherwise consider to be a normalized level of roughly $250 million per quarter. Obviously, these charges have been running at an elevated level and will continue to be difficult to predict particularly in this environment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Slide 19, shows total Citigroup net credit losses and loan loss reserves. Net credit losses continue to improve in the second quarter, down 10% sequentially to $3.6 billion and the net loan loss reserve release was $984 million. We ended the quarter with $27.6 billion of total loan loss reserves and our LLR ratio was 4.3%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Slide 20, shows our international consumer credit trend, which generally remains stable to improving in the second quarter. In Asia, the NCL rate remained below 1%, and 90 plus day delinquencies were flat at around 50 basis points. In Latin America, the NCL rate continue to improve to 4.1%, while delinquencies were fairly stable.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On slide 21, we show the North America mortgage portfolio in Citi Holdings, split between residential first mortgages and home equity loans. In residential first mortgages, we ended the quarter with $63 billion of loans, down 14% from a year ago, excluding the incremental mortgage charge-offs of $315 million in the first quarter. Net credit losses were roughly flat sequentially at $426 million, 90+ day delinquencies were down 3% to $3.8 billion driven by continued loan sales.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">In the second quarter, we sold approximately $500 million of delinquent mortgages. 30 to 89 day delinquencies were up slightly versus the prior quarter as expected driven by redefault of previously modified mortgages. In home equity loans, we ended the quarter with $37 billion of loan, down 13% from a year ago, excluding the incremental charge-offs of $55 million in the first quarter. Net credit losses were down 11% sequentially and 90+ day delinquencies were also down versus the prior quarter at $864 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">In total, we allocated roughly $9.5 billion of our loan loss reserves to North America real estate lending and Citi Holdings and we maintained over 30 months of coincident NCL coverage.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">On slide 22, we show our key capital metrics. As of the second quarter, our Basel I Tier 1 Common Ratio was 12.7%, adjusting for the final market risk rules recently adopted by the U.S. regulators that would be effective in January 2013. Our Basel I Tier 1 Common Ratio would be approximately 11.3%. Under Basel III, our estimated Tier 1 Common Ratio as of the second quarter was 7.9%, up from 7.2% in the first quarter. These estimates both include the impact of the final market risk rules and are based on the proposed advanced approach for calculating risk-weighted assets under the recent NPR.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">As you maybe aware, the regulatory proposals also requires Citi and other banks to calculate its risk-weighted assets under a newly defined standardized approach, and to use the lower of the two resulting ratios for our reported Basel III Tier 1 Common Ratio. We continue to review the implications of that standardized approach, but based on preliminary data, and I want to stress that this is preliminary.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Our estimated Basel III Tier 1 Common Ratio for the second quarter as calculated under this standardized approach approximates the ratio under the advanced calculation. However, the risk-weighted asset components are somewhat different. We continue to expect to be above an 8% Basel III Tier 1 Common Ratio later this year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Slide 23 shows the components of our Basel I and estimated Basel III Capital Ratio. As of the second quarter, our Tier 1 common capital under Basel I was $124 billion, compared to an estimated $99 billion under Basel III. Over half of the difference reflects that this allowance of our minority investments in unconsolidated financial institutions, with the remainder driven by pension liabilities within other comprehensive income and deferred tax assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Turning to the denominator, our total risk-weighted assets under Basel III as calculated using the proposed advanced approach were an estimated $1.25 trillion or 28% higher versus Basel I.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Looking at Citicorp and Corp/Other, our risk-weighted assets increased by only 15% reflecting the strong credit quality of our loan portfolio, the low asset intensity of our service businesses and our focus on flow facilitation in capital markets. The impact of Citi Holdings on our total risk-weighted assets will decrease over time as we continue to wind down those assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">On slide 24, we show our returns on tangible common equity, assuming TCE is allocated based on estimated Basel III risk-weighted assets. On this basis, the return on tangible common equity for Citicorp plus Corp/Other for the first half of 2012 was an estimated 15.9%, and including Citi Holdings, Citigroup generated return of nearly 9%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">On slide 25, we highlight our returns under Basel III; again using risk-weighted asset as calculated using the proposed advanced approach. Citigroup\u2019s return on Basel III assets for the first half of the year was an estimated 1%, including a 1.8% return for Citicorp plus Corp/Other. And if we assume Tier 1 common capital level of 9.5% of Basel III risk-weighted assets across each business, the return on Basel III capital for Citigroup would have been an estimated 10.6% for the first half of 2012, including a 19.3% return for our core businesses in Citicorp, plus Corp/Other.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Let me close with some comments about the outlook. First, Global Consumer Banking, overall credit quality remains good, with continued improvement in North America and stable credit in Asia and Latin America. We expect these trends to continue for the remainder of the year assuming no meaningful downturn in the global economy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Latin America, despite the noise this quarter from FX was the fastest growing of our regions in consumer. And we expect that to continue particularly in Mexico, given both market growth and the strength of our franchise.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Asia consumer revenue growth has slowed, reflecting the two principal issues that I mentioned. First, investment sales remain weak, as retail investors in Asia have de-risked giving the same global macro concerns that have slowed institutional activity. And second, specific country slowdowns, most notably in Korea where policy actions by the government have trimmed the availability of consumer credit in that market. We see these trends continuing in the near-term, which would imply some revenue headwinds for Asia, into the third and fourth quarters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">North America consumer benefited from another quarter of strong mortgage activity, which we currently expect will continue into the third quarter. However, in cards, high payment rates from consumers reflecting ongoing economic uncertainty and deleveraging, and our shift to higher credit quality borrowers continues to weigh on loan growth. This trend will likely remain into the third quarter as into meaningful improvement in the U.S. economy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Transaction Services continue to produce strong revenue and earnings growth, and had a second consecutive quarter of positive operating leverage that we expect will be sustainable going forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">In Securities and Banking there were a few key takeaways this quarter. First, the biggest challenge we and the industry face is the ongoing macro uncertainty, reflected in low levels of client activity. Without meaningful signs of accelerating economic growth or incredible resolution as perceived by the market to the European issues, the reduced activity is likely to persist into the third quarter. Having said that, the strength and breadth of our fixed-income franchise, particularly our rates and currencies business was evidenced in the second quarter, and first half of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Turning to equities; we believe our business has passed the problems of the second half of last year, and we continue to execute well, although low levels of client activity remain a substantial challenge, and that will likely continue into the third quarter. Our investment banking franchise continue to see momentum with wallet share gains in every major products, although overall market activity remained muted. Based on that, we are cautiously optimistic that our investments in our banking franchise are showing results.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Given the current operating environment, we remain very focused on rightsizing our businesses in securities and banking to the opportunity we see. And we are keeping a tight ring on expenses as the positive operating leverage we produced in the second quarter and the first half of 2012 demonstrates.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">In Holdings, the wind down of assets will continue, and our primary focus remains the mortgage portfolio. Mortgages continue to face a number of challenges including the substantial foreclosure backlog, ongoing political headwind, and the risk from any weakening of the U.S. economy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">As such, we have not released any general loan loss reserves against our mortgage portfolio to-date, and have maintained robust coverage ratios.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">In summary, one of the biggest issues we face remains the uncertain macro environment, and in particular the European sovereign debt issues. As such, we will continue to run our risk exposures very tightly, while serving our clients.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Basically, we will continue to manage what we can control, and limit our exposure to what we cannot control. Nonetheless, we remain optimistic about our prospects given our client franchise, our unique mix of businesses, and our unparalleled footprint.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Now, let me turn it back over to Vikram.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">John, thank you. And before we go to questions, I do want to point out to everybody that this is John Andrews\u2019 last earnings call. As we know, he\u2019ll be moving to the institutional clients business, and he\u2019ll be heading up our client content development there. John has been with Citi for over 3 years, and as all of you know, it\u2019s been an interesting three years. And throughout that time, John has served this company and our investors extraordinarily well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">He\u2019s not only a consummate professional who understands our business, but he\u2019s also been a strong advocate to the outside world and has provided wise counsel internally. But, he\u2019ll still be at Citi, and so we\u2019ll continue to be able to work together; in the mean time, Susan Kendall will be the acting Head of Investor Relations.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">John, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John Andrews</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And with that, we\u2019d be happy to take your questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p9\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">(Operator Instructions) And we\u2019ll go to Glenn Schorr with Nomura.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Glenn Schorr \u2013 Nomura Holdings Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thanks very much. Quick numbers \u2013 one first, tax rate as reported was low, but I\u2019m just curious on how much the Akbank sale or DVA/CVA might have been impact and what you think the core might be over the next say, four quarters?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Four quarter is a little bit far to go up Glen, but let me try to help you\u2026</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Glenn Schorr \u2013 Nomura Holdings Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Sure.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">\u2026for the balance of the year anyway. The effective tax rate in the second quarter was down about 500 basis points, I guess from the first quarter. And there is two factors that impact the tax rate in the second quarter; first, as you mentioned, the loss from the sale of Akbank it does carry a higher rate, certainly as it produces a higher tax benefit for us; but the second factor is, overall, we\u2019ve got a downward revision in our expected tax rate for 2012 due to a forecasted change in the mix of our earnings. So if you look at the first half of the year now, our effective tax rate is roughly 22% and that\u2019s the rate that you should expect us to have for the balance of the year. And if you look, it\u2019s basically the same tax rate as we had last year, if you would adjust the taxes for the Japan DTA write-off that we have. So we\u2019re roughly at 22% going forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Glenn Schorr \u2013 Nomura Holdings Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Got it. Okay, cool. On the MSSB potential, 14% transaction, assuming we get a price whether it would be agreed upon or through arbitration that\u2019s anything lower than what you have at mark. I\u2019m just checking, do you take the full marks on the full position, but you only get the partial capital benefit is that how, do I remember correctly?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Well, it depends on exactly what charge we take, how far off, if any, the let\u2019s call it the third party appraiser comes in, but whatever mark that we would potentially have to take in the third quarter, that would be probably a full mark and we would get the full benefit of the payments. Don\u2019t forget from a Basel III point of view, any mark is irrelevant against our Basel III capital ratio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Glenn Schorr \u2013 Nomura Holdings Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yeah.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">But Basel III point of view, we basically have written the entire investment off at this point in time as required under the rules for investments and unconsolidated financial subs above 10%. So, any mark will have zero impact on Basel III ratio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Glenn Schorr \u2013 Nomura Holdings Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Say, it\u2019s the fair point. I know you\u2019re going to be limited here, but if you could help us with anything on LIBOR, I know back in December you said other than Japan and then you had specific comments about internal investigations in the UK at the time of the Barclays release. Just curious, what you could share with us, whether it would be internal investigation or anything else?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Well, let me take that Glenn. And yes, we are a member of number of inter-bank rate-setting panels. And we, as well as other banks, have received request for information and we\u2019re cooperating with them. These are confidential requests, but they were fully cooperating with government authorities on these matters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">The only I can say to you is though we can\u2019t discuss any details, do not infer from the situation of one LIBOR submitting bank that every bank is in the same or a similar position and I think it\u2019s not the case you can draw conclusions about the regulatory consequences for any one particular bank. That\u2019s about all I can say at this point, we did make a statement when \u2013 or rather there were a classifications when they were issues that came up in the UK and you already know about the investigation that is ongoing in Tokyo.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Glenn Schorr \u2013 Nomura Holdings Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay, thanks Vikram. Thanks, John.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay, Glenn.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And we\u2019ll go to John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John E. McDonald \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes, hi, John. I was wondering if we could just clarify the expense, comments that you made. I think you said that you expect the kind of core $11.5 billion, you think you could hold that for the rest of this year each quarter, is that right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yeah, that\u2019s right, say John, at or below the $11.5 million for each of the...</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John E. McDonald \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. And then on the other stuff, the litigation and the repositioning, the episodic stuff. Did you say that you kind of see $250 million as what you might call a regular occurrence of that, and you\u2019ve been above that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yeah, that\u2019s exactly right, if you go back on a more normalized level, we would expect those types of expenses to run something about $250 million or so a quarter, call it a $1 billion a year. Obviously they have been running at elevated levels for the first half of the year and for last year as well. And it\u2019s a little bit difficult to predict exactly where those types of expense are going to go for the second half.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John E. McDonald \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. So is that your hope that they\u2019re in that $250 million range each quarter and that\u2019s combined, those two things combined the next two quarters but obviously you can know for sure.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I wouldn\u2019t put hope, I would say that our expectation of normalized level to be put them at $250 million. From the \u2013 third and the fourth quarter, I think that it\u2019s likely to, you should assume that they will continue to run at somewhat elevated level, although...</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John E. McDonald \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">\u2026I can\u2019t predict what they are going to be.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John E. McDonald \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay, got it. That's helpful. And then on the net interest income and the net interest margin, the margin down 9 basis points, just a little more than you had thought it might be a few months ago. What were the drivers of that and what kind of outlook might you have on the margin and net interest income potential?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yeah. I think we had said that it would probably be around 285 plus or minus one or two basis point. So we\u2019re somewhere around 3 maybe 4 basis points off that guidance that we had given. And basically the entire \u2013 this three basis points of it, the entire shot fall is just about entirely due to some higher than anticipated levels of prepayments that we\u2019ve got in our branded cards portfolio in April of this quarter. The payments were higher than what we would have normally anticipated. I can tell you that the payments now has \u2013 payment rate has stabilized, so it\u2019s not something where we can see that throughout the balance of the quarter. So I would say that, consistent with our previous guidance, I would expect NIM to more or less stabilize at the second quarter levels for the balance of the year. Again, as always plus or minus 2 or 3 basis points.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John E. McDonald \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay and that includes the benefit of TruPS redemptions and any other actions around the debt footprints that you\u2019ve talked about?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yeah, if you remember, I think even back in the second quarter, I had mentioned that the continued reduction in long-term debt would be one of the tailwinds that we as far as benefiting NIM.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John E. McDonald \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. And then separately, could you update us on where the DTA stood at quarter-end John? And whether you consumed or built any DTA this quarter and any expectations you have for the rest of this year on that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">In the second quarter DTA came down roughly a $1 billion from where we were at the end of the first quarter. There is about three factors that play into that, there is about roughly $200 million of that decline comes from components of OCI, there is another $300 million that is really just the FX impact on DTA that we have in our balance sheet that\u2019s carried, in foreign currencies, and then there is a $0.5 billion due to a \u2013 just a balance sheet adjustment for some purchased foreign NOLs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John E. McDonald \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. Okay, great. And then, last question for me on the equities, does the weakness this quarter have anything to do with the weakness in the second half of this year or is it more just a pure volume and cash equities issue this quarter. Could you just give some color on what happened this quarter and compared to the back half of last year please.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Actually the client volumes in the second quarter were up a little bit perhaps from the fourth quarter of last year. And so we actually against where the revenues were from the equities business in the second half of the year, the second quarter, by comparison, looks pretty strong. So we actually think that the business did fairly well in the second quarter, there is always room for improvement, we\u2019d like to be able to grow our prime finance business a little bit more, so there were somewhat less disruptable just to changes in market volumes, but the business did okay given the market volumes that were out there this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John E. McDonald \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thank you. Jim Mitchell, Buckingham Research.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>James F. Mitchell \u2013 The Buckingham Research Group Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yeah, hi, good morning. Firstly, maybe we could just talk about Asia, you\u2019ve highlighted that things are slowing not surprising, does it change the way you think about the investment spend over there, I know you\u2019ve been bulking up pretty aggressively in China on the retail footprint in Asia, at Japan, is it change at all?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">What I would say is again I split Asia into variety of different parts, and John talked about that briefly, the shift in Korea is the regulatory shift. We have a fairly decent size presence in Korea. And that's not a place where we've been investing in any case, it's an adjustment to new regulatory phase, just as the U.S. business is doing that on the retail side. Japan, we've had our own issues there, and that's also been reflected there, and we really haven't been investing in Japan either.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I'd said a little bit earlier, I think we believe that at least we feel better about lot of the Asian economies, and we did few months back, and frankly we feel better about that and some of the market perceptions out there. Our ability to grow in China is important to us, and we'll continue to do that. Our ability to do whatever we can in India is important, although there are regulatory constraints in what we can do.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So a big part of what we wanted to do, we got done last year in terms of investments in Asia, hereon in terms of our growth it's going to be country-by-country depending upon where we have regulatory permission and where we see growth, some of that may continue, although it will be at a very different pace than it was last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>James F. Mitchell \u2013 The Buckingham Research Group Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay, that's helpful. And John maybe the mortgage business, I know you've perennially been negative. What is that going to take as we hear more and more anecdotal evidence of things or at least maybe you're stabilizing people are getting more optimistic. What do you need to see the release reserves?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Well, I think what people see right now would be pocket of improvement. And to the extent that there are some green shoots out there that \u2013 that\u2019s great.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">We\u2019re still very focused as I said in the prepared remarks, as far as the risk of the foreclosure overhang, I mean there are still an awful lot of foreclosed \u2013 or foreclosures and profits that had yet to hit the market. So I don\u2019t look at this yet as being a robust housing situation, and maybe a little bit of it comes from the fact that \u2013 I\u2019d lived through the mortgage issues of the early 90s and it took years for that to clear up. And in comparison the early 90s were small potatoes compared to what we\u2019re going through now. So I need to see a little bit more evidence and I think I speak for Brian Leach<strong>, </strong>our Chief Risk Officer, as well as for that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>James F. Mitchell \u2013 The Buckingham Research Group Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">That\u2019s fair. Okay, thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Brennan Hawken with UBS.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS Investment Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Hi, thanks. So just real quick following up on the question in Asia, it\u2019s certainly encouraging that you guys have seen \u2013 are feeling better than you were a few months back. It might be helpful if you could give us a bit more color on what you\u2019re seeing there, that\u2019s giving you that confidence. From my end, I was kind of surprised to see the continued strong purchase sale growth, so maybe if you could let us know if there was some specific that was driving that in certain markets that were stronger than others. Just maybe give a little bit more color because I think there are great deals, investors are quite concerned about growth in the region?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yeah, let me start by saying overall comment in Asia given the low amounts of fiscal or government debt and kind of the strong overall nature of the economy still, I mean we are doing whether China grows at 7%, 8% or 7.5%, 8.5% rather than 8%, 9%. So given the strong nature of the underlying fundamentals did got ample policy room, that\u2019s the first thing to keep in mind, and then we\u2019ve actually been using it, and that\u2019s an important perspective to keep in mind in terms of the trajectories of this economy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Secondly, some of the growth issues have been affected by the supply side issues, Asia needs a lot more infrastructure, we are seeing signs in certain countries where that\u2019s changing as well. And so if the impact on Asia was the cause of Europe slowing down and the impact on Asia was the cause of lack of the export markets. Some of that is being made up or with policy alternatives, a shift towards consumers consuming and infrastructure spending and we see that so to step on the ground, and that\u2019s important. The broader trend, which gets to what are the clientele or what is the clientele we serve, we are largely an urban bank in Asia and cities are growing despite all of these things, urbanization is a very powerful trend, middleclass is growing, people are coming into the cities that\u2019s what drives our business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So yes, the macro is important, as I said I\u2019m feeling better about the macro than I did myself a few months back. It\u2019s the micro that\u2019s really important, our clientele, urbanization, rise of the middleclass there, that\u2019s where it\u2019s coming from. And then when you look at, well, what part of Asia? Yes, there are some country differences, no question about that and we talked about that, Korea has the country difference where \u2013 it has the regulatory driven country difference. But when you get to the urban centers, they have a lot more in common each other than we believe. And so that\u2019s really what\u2019s driving it, and the urbanization theme is really a powerful driver, it transcends the GDP growth theme. We don\u2019t have numbers for that to share with you on a macro basis, but that\u2019s what drives the business and we continue to be very comfortable with that theme, it continues for a long time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS Investment Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your question on cards, I think the region overall, again under excess tax basis had purchase sales growing about 7% year-over-year. And we saw purchase sale growing in most of the countries quite frankly, of the top of my head, Australia, India, Singapore, and Hong Kong would all be countries where we had reasonably good purchase sale growth year-over-year. So it\u2019s not concentrated in just one market.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS Investment Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay, that\u2019s great. Quick question, it\u2019s just basically a clarification. Vikram has quoted in the press regarding return of capital over the weekend. And I just wanted to make sure, as far as the timing that was referenced in that article, were you just referring to the standard CCAR process that\u2019s going to get back in for 2013 or was that actually something outside that state of process?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Well, first of all, let me tell you exactly where we are, that\u2019s the better way to start. One, it is about the CCAR process, but more importantly even before you get there, our priority right now is earnings generation, it\u2019s capital creation, and we\u2019ve been doing that. And that\u2019s the reason why we expect to be above 8% or maybe more by year-end. And that\u2019s what\u2019s driving us. I\u2019ve also said, we are committed to creating returns for you and return in capital, especially as you look at the stock, this represents compelling value. Having said that, we have to go through the CCAR process. This is a decision that\u2019s made by us with the regulators. And frankly at this point, we really haven\u2019t decided what we\u2019re going to do and we will decide on that when we get closer and when we get closer to submitting CCAR, that point will make a clarity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS Investment Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Great, okay. And then last one from me, Visa and MasterCard settled on Friday, I think you all have been, certainly the results have reflected some reserving there. So my guess is that you are fully reserved, but if you could maybe give some color now that we see the actual settlement in writing? And then separately, when you think about \u2013 it seems like so they\u2019re basically making a bad debt, consumers \u2013 there won\u2019t be a big change in behavior and that there won\u2019t be much momentum behind, separately charging for credit card. Can you talk about what your view is on that? And how much \u2013 remind us how much of the $3.6 billion in credit card fees that you all had in 2011, is credit card fee versus debit and then what your view is on the higher end consumer and whether or not maybe if there is an additional charge those folks could start to bulk at that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. There was about \u2013 there is about 10 questions there. I\u2019m not quite sure I wrote them all down, but I\u2019m going to \u2013 I will try to answer what I remember and then whatever I leave out comes back at me, all right. For the settlement, they are going to announce, I'm not going to go into the details of the merchant settlement, we\u2019re actually not allowed to do that, there is actually confidentiality restrictions that have been posed by the court. I can tell you that we were fully accrued as of the end of the second quarter for our expected share of this settlement. And as far as future impacts of the proposed network will changes, it\u2019s far too early to try to guess what those maybe, I mean the documents are \u2013 I think the ink is still wet in front of the court. So it's a little hard to sit there right now and come to some sort of judgment as to what the impact could be on Citi's hardest businesses. And whatever impact it will be, it will based upon factors really outside of our control, including merchants behavior in response to the new rules, so all of this is a little bit hard to judge right now. You asked the question about credit card fees, don't forget debit fees are very, very small percentage of our overall fees, which is why we didn't have as much impact in Durbin Amendment as other institution. I'm not quite sure what else I left out from the question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS Investment Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">That was the \u2013 that\u2019s the big thing there. So that 3.6 from last year, which should basically sit in, it\u2019s pretty much all credit?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I think the debit fee is around a couple of $100 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS Investment Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Perfect. Okay, thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And we'll go to Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Great, thanks. Hi, John, could you talk a little bit about whether the credit or revenue trends that you're seeing in the consumer bank in Asia and Latin America kind of are consistent with the local markets better, are there any where they are weaker, can you just talk about how you see them kind of competitively positioned? And I\u2019ve got a follow-up.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Well, Moshe, don't forget, we have are very specific target market in that region. And we\u2019re focused for the most part on, what we would say is a very highly creditworthy customer base. And we\u2019re also very cautious as far as how we extend credit cards as well as even with secured lending that we do on mortgage, we actually benefit from a lot of the regulatory rules in those countries, which insist on, very, very low loan to value type of requirement. So we think that the \u2013 certainly from an Asia point of view, again, we\u2019ve got some extraordinary performance at this point in time, but we think that it is running in line with what we would anticipate from the market segments that we choose to serve.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. Just kind of a going at the question about the reserve on the mortgage kind of a different way, I understand you\u2019re kind of reluctance from a kind of how you feel about how robust the recovery is, but one would think kind of point-to-point, the quality of the portfolio kind of has improved relative to those reserves and there must be a trigger at least from an accounting standpoint that would say, if it was adequate before, it\u2019s got to be more than adequate now. I mean are we at least approaching something like that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Hard for me to say what we\u2019re approaching. We feel that we maintain adequate reserves and they\u2019re appropriate given the current economic environment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">One of your large competitors did report on Friday and kind of made the comment that they felt like they were at the point where they\u2019re kind of were passing through that tipping point as it were from that standpoint.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Moshe, not be disrespectful sir, but maybe you really want to direct your question at them.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Right, right. And you\u2019ve got more months to coverage too, so anyway.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yeah, one thing I just wanted to be clear on. The one thing you will see as we have said, as we begin to incur credit losses in connection with the national mortgage settlement, we will release reserves to cover those losses because those loans have been fully reserved for. And so, we will be doing some level of reserve releases now, those amounts, at least the data been fairly modest\u2026</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Got it, thanks a lot.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">But if your question is more towards general reserves, then we\u2019re not prepared to release it yet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer &amp; Company</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Christoph M. Kotowski \u2013 Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yeah, good morning. First, your Basel III ratio went up and other larger banks that reported went down. Is that just the impact of winding down Citi Holdings?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">No, I don\u2019t think so. I can\u2019t comment on why other institutions had their ratio go down. As we\u2019ve commented and I\u2019ve specifically commented on this, until the MPR came out, everybody was just estimating what their Basel III ratios are. And as I had mentioned, we were trying to be very conservative in how we were estimating our Basel III ratio. So, we had communicated to you that our Basel III ratio was 7.2% in the first quarter, and after we went through the volumes of the MPR in the final rule-making, we came out, we were still at 7.2%, which is \u2013 but it reflected a certain amount of conservatism on our part going into calculating that 7.2%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Christoph M. Kotowski \u2013 Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And so now when you look at the growth from 7.2% to 7.9%, I\u2019d say, there is some impact in there of course from Akbank. The Akbank sale generated 23 basis points or so of improvement, but line share of the improvement is really due to income.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Christoph M. Kotowski \u2013 Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. And then secondly, Vikram in his opening comments said he\u2019d become more encouraged in the last several months. And I\u2019m just curious what are you looking at that gives \u2013 what\u2019s changed that makes you more encouraged about emerging market trends?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. I think \u2013 and I think it\u2019s important to qualify it that way. We continue to be concerned about Europe and we are managing our risk extremely tightly as a result of that and obviously you see what\u2019s going on in the U.S., you all are as close to it as we are as well, we would all like to see more job creation in the U.S. The emerging market story to me is again what we see on the ground and we see a lot of policy alternatives being put into places, lot of actions being taken by government. We see it move in different parts of the world to make those investments and infrastructure, which raises investment spending in these countries and we see a lot of these economies are very actively managed and they too felt the impact of the European slowdown and they are doing what they can to deal with that. And so whereas a few months ago, we had the impact of the euro zone coming at it, not clear what the policy alternatives or what the active management of these economies were going to be. We are seeing that right now and in addition to that, as John talked about, we\u2019re seeing that in our consumer businesses as we talked about purchase sales and what\u2019s happening with the key trends, the key trends in the emerging markets is urbanization, when you sort of cut through all of that, that\u2019s where the growth is coming from and that trend continues. So it\u2019s fusing together lot of data point, that\u2019s one of the unique advantages we have at Citi. I mean, we are in just about every country that\u2019s some of the emerging markets, and we have the manners to be able to talk to our people on the ground, get the information pieces all together, that\u2019s what drives my thinking.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Christoph M. Kotowski \u2013 Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. And then, if I can come back at the credit card settlement question in a different way. It seems to me the big structural change really is the ability for merchants to have a surcharge on credit card transactions. And at least you must have done some analysis around the merchant\u2019s proclivity to do that and maybe look at the case study of gas stations which have been able to do it for years, right? So have you done any analysis around how likely merchants are about to introduce a surcharge?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">There is analysis that our card guys have done on that, but I am not prepared to comment on that analysis at this point in time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Christoph M. Kotowski \u2013 Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay, and then lastly just a small question. On page sixteen, under Citi Holdings asset summary, the assets listed next to the MSSB van chart $20 billion and it had been $25 billion for the last couple of quarters. Is that in any way revolved around the buy down or what it was?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">No, no, as you may recall, we had mentioned in the past there were certain margin loans that we\u2019ve been carrying on our books as the joint venture has began to set-up, it was in process of setting up their own systems. Those systems now have begun to come online, and so we\u2019re here starting to see a shift in those loans being moved up of our books on to the books of the joint venture itself.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Christoph M. Kotowski \u2013 Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay, great. That\u2019s it from me. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Matt O'Connor, Deutsche Bank.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Matthew O'Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thanks for taking my question. If I could follow-up on expenses, a lot of talk about right sizing to the expected environment, and it sounds like specifically within the SMB where we had seen some expense management, special look in year-over-year expense severance. And can you just give some color in terms of how much of the decline in expenses that we\u2019d seen, and as you think about going forward it\u2019s coming from lower compensation, how much is bringing down the headcount, and then just all conceptually, obviously, that could give a solid numbers, but also like certain businesses that you may look to prune, how should we think about those two components in terms of both driving the expense progress so far and what might be on the table going forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Matt, I was having a hard time following all of your questions. And so I apologize, but in general we \u2013 as I said, we target a 3% to 5% reduction in expenses in every business going into each and every year, that\u2019s our expectation, that businesses are going to be able to produce operating efficiencies. And I think that you will see that in one of the slides that we got on the deck here, the quarter I think we\u2019ve generated about, I think it\u2019s $700 million worth of efficiency savings, and we\u2019ve done about $1.3 billion for the first half, which is in the slide that\u2019s somewhere in the back of the deck. So these are things that we work all the time. Specifically, you take a look at compensation costs, you take a look in the supplement that we provide you, we breakout compensation cost, compensation cost for the first half of the year are down something on the order of 4% or 5%, I don\u2019t recall the number just not in the top of my head. So there certainty is a good element of headcount reduction that is contributing to the overall expense reduction. Is that right.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Matthew O'Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Yeah, specifically within the Securities and Banking segment, obviously the question that I\u2019m sure you guys were asking yourself and a lot of other of your peers, how long will revenues remain in a pressure and what are some<strong> [</strong>levers<strong>] </strong>that you can pull. Going forward how do we think about potential savings from lower comp, lower headcount or actual businesses that that you might just add to that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Yeah, and Matt, as we had said in the past, and as we continue to say, we\u2019re very focused on making sure that we\u2019ve got the right resources in that business to deal with the opportunities that we see. You\u2019ve seen expenses coming down in the business year-on-year that now had two consecutive quarters of lowering expenses. And we\u2019re going to continue to look at that business and make sure that we\u2019ve got it size appropriately, but I\u2019m not going to tell you that you should expect to see two more quarters of expense reduction coming out of securities and banking.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Matthew O'Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay, and then just separately as we think about the Basel III Tier 1 common target of greater than 8% obviously you\u2019re getting by the end of the year, are you already within the striking difference of that. Is there anything unusual that might limit kind of the capital build or from here is that just a matter of you make money and what the RWA is continue to what they do? Is there anything that would, I guess, it seems like you are being more conservative, because you are pretty close to the 8% now, and I just want to make sure there\u2019s nothing that might offset that next couple of quarters?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">No, I mean, it really is down to a \u2013 to the extent they represent anything that\u2019s a simple formula. It really is about making money and adding to your capital base. And that is very much what we\u2019re focused on.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Matthew O'Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay, then just lastly on the LIBOR both you and JPMorgan have said and you kind of like comment on it, that both of you have also said, don\u2019t assume that all banks are the same, which I think some people are interpreting as a positive that you might be less exposed. So I just want to ask again, if there is anything more that you can say, and if not when will investors and analysts have a better sense of what\u2019s going on, the timeline if you could offer anything there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">It\u2019s hard to say. I think these are all government investigations around the world, they\u2019re going to take their time. One thing we can assure you is, you\u2019ll know at the same time we will. And beyond that really there\u2019s really nothing more to add on that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Matthew O'Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Gerard Cassidy with RBC.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC Capital Markets</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Thank you. Good morning. John you talked about the securities business and the outlook for third quarter, and borrowing any major changes in the economy or in the capital markets, you saw that the activity would be similar to the second quarter. The question, would this, is it similar in the sense that we should see a flat sequential number than Q3 to Q2 or you suggesting that the decline on a sequential basis could be equivalent in the third quarter versus the second quarter \u2013 to the first quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Gerard, we feel pretty good about the performance, we\u2019re very good about the performance that our Securities and Banking business had in the second quarter given the market environment in the second quarter. And there's nothing unusual about the revenues that we put up in the second quarter in that market environment. So as you start to think about what market environment you maybe modeling for in the third and the fourth quarter, you could look at our second quarter performance is being reflective of the environment that we had in the second quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And let me just add to that. We have made changes to that business since the fourth quarter last year, structural changes, cost changes, reengineering changes, and some of them obviously you\u2019ve seen in the expense numbers not all of them are completely done yet. And that's just to provide you a little bit more color to what John just talked about.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC Capital Markets</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay, thank you. On the mortgage business where you guys had the gains this quarter, from a basis point standpoint, what were the spreads on the sales of mortgages in the second quarter versus where they were in the first quarter, has they widened out or shrink?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">The overall gain on sales spreads were down a little bit in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. I want to say they were down something on the order of, maybe 40 basis points or something like that, 30 basis points, I just don't have that number on the top of my head.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC Capital Markets</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Would you say that the gains still though are materially above historical spreads that you would see in this type of \u2013 in the sales activity?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yes, I would definitely say they\u2019re still well above the historical levels.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC Capital Markets</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Do you think that, I hate to say this is a new norm, but if rates stay where they are as the Fed has suggested they want or see through the end of \u201814, and we don't know what volumes will be of course, but you think the spreads could actually stay at least on initially high level for a longer period of time?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">That's a little hard to predict that, but it could go on till, did you say 2014?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC Capital Markets</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">(Inaudible)</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Let\u2019s stay focused on the third and the fourth quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC Capital Markets</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yeah, sure.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yeah, as we said we think that the current levels of that refinancing activity should stay high certainly into the third and probably in the fourth quarter. But once you get beyond the third or the fourth quarter, you\u2019re somewhat testing liability to forecast.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC Capital Markets</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Sure, understandable. The other question I had was, you guys mentioned that there has been a structural change in Korea, in terms on the consumer banking business. Can you share with us, what percentage of Asia is Korea, and also could you tell us, will the revenues be smaller as we go forward as a percentage of Asia because of these changes?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">We give a breakout in the back of the investor presentation as far as key countries and the revenue component that we have for those countries, and you can see Korea\u2019s revenue is broken out, Korea\u2019s portfolios, the asset level in Korea broken out and you can compare that to overall Asia and enjoy your own conclusion as far as the percentage that Korea might contribute.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC Capital Markets</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Great. And then finally, what\u2019s the duration now of the securities portfolio, the investment securities portfolio?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Overall, it\u2019s still fairly short, it\u2019s something right around \u2013 I think we\u2019ve said this in the past that it\u2019s somewhere around two years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC Capital Markets</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Ed Najarian with ISI Group.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Edward Najarian \u2013 ISI Group</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Yeah, good morning. I was wondering if you could just comment on where you stand in your negotiations with Morgan Stanley on the 14% sale of the joint venture, we haven\u2019t see a deal yet, our discussions progressing, have you \u2013 has they moved to an arbitrage trader? Is there anything you can tell us about, sort of the timing, do you still expect to complete that sale, potentially say in the third quarter or just what can you tell us given that we haven\u2019t see a deal yet?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Well, it\u2019s actually pretty simple, later today I believe we should be exchanging values with Morgan Stanley. And our expectation is that the two firms will be more than 10% apart and that means that the process will then go to a third party appraiser. That\u2019s how it is laid out in the contract. Third-party appraiser, I think there is \u2013 I know if it\u2019s five or six days that we get to \u2013 could see appraiser and then the appraiser has a certain amount of time, but the expectation is that the appraiser needs to complete their work by somewhere around August 30, and the contract, I believe that there is the transaction closes no later than September 7 by contract.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Edward Najarian \u2013 ISI Group</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay. Very helpful, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John C.

Ganucheau \u2013 Carlson Capital LP</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Hey guys, I made it in. John Andrews, I wanted to thank you, you\u2019ve always been extremely responsive and thoughtful and been very helpful, from my part I need to see you move know, but I know it\u2019s the bigger and better things.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">On the LIBOR issues, let me try it a different way, is it unreasonable to infer that since you have the TIBOR issue in Japan, that you have internally reviewed other areas such as LIBOR, I\u2019m just trying to get a sense for if I can even put that in, I can feel a little better about this issue or would you have me take no wait into that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Yeah, I really don\u2019t want to go beyond what we said. It was rather a complete answering at the first time. I understand you are wanting to know more, but having said that, let\u2019s just let these things play out.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Peter F. Ganucheau \u2013 Carlson Capital LP</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">That\u2019s fair. Thanks guys.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Vikram S.

Just one question, I\u2019m wondering is it possible at all to get the numbers for 1Q 2012 for Basel III, maybe the RWA\u2019s<strong> </strong>are tough, but capital might be more doable?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I\u2019m sorry. You completely got me off. The RWA\u2019s for the first quarter \u201912 associated with Basel III?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Betsy L. Graseck Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.

Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I\u2019m just turning to slide 23, just to make sure.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Betsy L. Graseck Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Sure.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">So, it\u2019s not going to be the \u2013 but okay, that\u2019s based upon end-of-period though. You can take a look at the end-of-period amounts that we\u2019ve gotten for Basel III laid out on slide 23. I\u2019m sorry, slide 23 is the end-of-period. Okay, I just want to make sure I was in the right \u2013 had the right, right reframe of reference.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Betsy L. Graseck Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Okay. Though, I will follow-up later on that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Yeah, why don\u2019t you call IR?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Betsy L. Graseck Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Sure.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">(Inaudible)</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Betsy L. Graseck Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Got it. And then the second question, just on Citi Holdings and LCL obviously coming down nicely. Just a question as how much is the decline in LCL and Citi Holdings active versus passive?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Betsy, help me understand active and passive.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Betsy L. Graseck Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">So is it just pay downs from your current holders or are you benefitting from being able to sell some of your assets more actively to investors potentially and realizing some gains or losses as you\u2019re disposing them more rapidly than just P&amp;I payments?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Now we\u2019re active sellers. I mean even in the mortgages as we said, we sold $500 million worth of delinquent loans this quarter. and in virtually every one of the businesses, we certainly look for sales wherever we can get it, one of the things that you should have seen is, the business in Belgium came out this quarter. So that was part of the reduction, so that represent the sale. And you\u2019ll see that basically it\u2019s a difference on the international line at least $3 billion of the international line difference relates to the sale of Belgium. So we\u2019re still looking to sell portfolios, it certainly is an active part of what the people and holdings look to do everyday.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Betsy L. Graseck Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Okay. And then lastly on holdings, is there anything else in holdings that you\u2019d want to be retaining or should we expect that everything in holdings right now is related for elimination over time. and if there\u2019s any commentary around the CitiFinancial, that at one point was going to be in sales?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Betsy, should think that everything in holdings we are looking to either sell or wind down. and I don\u2019t have any update specifically to the financial.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Betsy L. Graseck Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Okay, thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Matt Burnell, Wells Fargo Securities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Matthew Burnell \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, Llc</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Good morning, thanks for taking my questions. First, John, you mentioned that you continued to be focused on the events in Europe. It looks from the disclosure in the slide deck today that your net funded exposure in the GIIPS countries has not really moved very much from the end of the first quarter. I guess I\u2019m just curious given that one of your large competitors did sound a bit more cautious on Europe this quarter versus last quarter. Have your unfunded exposures in Europe given that they are larger than the \u2013 than some of your competitors, have those come down over the course of the past three to six months?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">I think if you compare the information on page 36. Page 36 is where we got the GIIPS and 37, the slide following that, I believe that we actually give you what the current unfunded commitments are for the GIIPS countries. And I believe the unfunded commitments actually increased by maybe $1 billion over the course of the last three months. But again, all of this is well within, what we believe is our risk appetite for these countries. And you\u2019ll also notice that when you look at the GIIPS, the funded credit exposure, the total current funded exposure actually came down by about $700 million or so, that\u2019s largely due to trading assets and AFS exposure. The funded credit exposure was flat. But I think if you look at the table, we give you the components of the exposure broken out between sovereigns, financial institutions and corporate. And what you\u2019ll see is that while the exposure remain flat there was a change in mix, so that more of that flat exposure now was directly related to corporate customers. And again, this is where, we\u2019re in the business of serving our customers in those countries; we want to make sure that we are there for our clients.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Let me just add one thing. We've been cautious on Europe for the last 18 months, and maybe some of our competitors are just catching up to that consciousness. And by the way, it takes a long time to bring exposures down. And one thing that John said is really important, when you look about \u2013 think about Europe, you\u2019ve got to separate out the multinationals that are all over the world, and some of them are with higher quality than their host countries. And so our exposure reports try to break those out as much as possible, but we are on top of this constantly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Matthew Burnell \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, Llc</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Okay, that's helpful. And John, just a follow-up on the DTA question. You mentioned about a $0.5 billion of the DTA benefit this quarter came from the purchase of foreign NOLs. Is it your expectation that you will continue to purchase those foreign NOLs or is that more episodic event?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">No, actually what I thought I said, it's a balance sheet adjustment for purchases of NOLs that we had done in the past. In other words, we had in the past, purchased some foreign NOLs, we didn\u2019t pass the benefit through the income statement. So we had an increase to deferred tax asset and then a deferred liability, not deferred tax liability, but an unearned income liability sitting on the balance sheet. And we just don't feel that that\u2019s something that we need to have at this point in time. So we just took the opportunity to reduce both the asset and the liability side of the balance sheet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Matthew Burnell \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, Llc</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Okay. Thanks for the clarification there. And then finally, it sounds like you\u2019ve got a somewhat heightened competence of operating leverage trends within the North America and GCB. And I\u2019m curious is to how of that is driven by the relatively strong performance now, and it sounds like you expected to continue in the third quarter in the mortgage business versus some of the other businesses within North America?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Yeah, a good question. On the past, we had said that we expect to have North America add sustainable positive operating leverage in the fourth quarter. I think that given where mortgages are, we\u2019re likely to have positive operating leverage in North America now in both the third and the fourth quarter. Although I have to admit that going into next year then those elevated levels of mortgage sales will give us some difficult comps that we\u2019ll have to take a look at.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Matthew Burnell \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, Llc</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Okay. Thanks for taking my question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Not a problem.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Todd Hagerman, Sterne Agee</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Todd Hagerman \u2013 Sterne, Agee &amp; Leach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Good morning, everybody. John, just a question on the North American consumer. What we\u2019ve seen in last couple quarters again with the reserve release you guys again have been fairly conservative as the coverage ratios remain very strong. I\u2019m just thinking as particularly with the card business being a big bulk of the reserve release, it seem to be either add or pass kind of more normalized levels if you will, whereas the consumer mortgage of retail piece seems to be trending now more at stabilized level. So how should we think about kind of the magnitude reserve release going forward as you balance between the card improvement in more stabilization on the consumer side mortgage?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Yeah, I wouldn\u2019t sit here and start to forecasting where we\u2019re going to be as far as loan loss reserve releases in the future. I can tell you that both of our card portfolios in North America, both the branded as well as retail services. The credit trends remain very positive, and our view is that you should continue to see improvement in the level of NCLs and in the NCL rate in both of those portfolios through the end of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Todd Hagerman \u2013 Sterne, Agee &amp; Leach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Okay. And so at this point you\u2019re not thinking necessarily<strong> \u2013 </strong>any necessarily change near-term in terms of the pace, what we\u2019ve been seen in the last couple of quarters?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">I don\u2019t want to get into a quarter-by-quarter pace. But you should anticipate that NCL rate coming, still declining in both portfolios.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Todd Hagerman \u2013 Sterne, Agee &amp; Leach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Okay. And then just separately you guys put out the statement on the Moody\u2019s downgrade. Just how should I think about with the ongoing of deleveraging on the debt side? Your comments previously about spread margin, how should we think about that financial impact at this point as it has became more significant at this stage of the game?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">I kind of lost the drift of your question, but can you tell one more time?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Todd Hagerman \u2013 Sterne, Agee &amp; Leach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Yeah, with the recent Moody\u2019s downgrade, you putted out a statement challenging that downgrade from your perspective in terms of how that is drift, how the rating agencies have drifted over the past year or so? It appears now that we\u2019re now likely to see a more meaningful impact at this stage. But I\u2019m just trying to think how I<strong> </strong>weigh that downgrade or where we\u2019ve come in the last 12 months relative to your ongoing deleveraging efforts and your comments related to spread NII and margin?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Yeah, I actually, I think one of the things that you could take a look at is, take a look at some of our bond \u2013 our cash spreads and how they have performed? If you take a look at our ten-year rate or five-year rate, I think what you will see, is that if you go back to February when Moody\u2019s first \u2013 the day after Moody\u2019s announcement, they were going to downgrade banks. And then take a look at how our bond spreads or cash spreads have performed from that day to day after the initial announcement to the day after they finally then announced the actual downgrade, our bond spreads have actually improved. and I think that that somewhat speaks for the way that the market is looking at the strength of our balance sheet. they can see the capital. they can see the liquidity. they can see the improved risk metrics. I think that that\u2019s a much bigger driver of our bond spreads at this point in time than the Moody\u2019s rating.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Just add to that ultimately bond spreads are going to be influenced by 7.9% Basel III capital now going higher as we said. going forward, I get sustainable earnings. slides seven and eight, I think are really important. They talk about the earnings power of the company. And the markets know that sometimes more than people who analyze these things from the outside do, and I think that\u2019s going to have a bigger impact.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Todd Hagerman \u2013 Sterne, Agee &amp; Leach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">I think that\u2019s a fair point. and I guess this is more \u2013 I think the longer-term debt has widened a bit over the last couple of months, and that sort I guess I was more focused on in the short-term cash spreads.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Yeah, to the extent that if you look at what\u2019s happened with the long-term debt, and I tend to look at it from Moody\u2019s announcement to post-Moody\u2019s to the final Moody\u2019s announcement, and then during the last couple of weeks. During the last couple of weeks, our bond spreads have widened a bit, but I think that that\u2019s much more a focus as to what was happening in the market from the euro point of view as opposed to a Moody's reaction.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Todd Hagerman \u2013 Sterne, Agee &amp; Leach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">That's helpful, thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Not a problem.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">And we'll go to Andrew Marquardt with Evercore Partners.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt \u2013 Evercore Partners</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Thanks guys. Just a couple of questions to clarify, on expenses it sounds like NGT in North America positive operating leverage still be achieved by year end and if anything actually third quarter, and then how you feel better about. And should we still expect LATAM consumer to continue to provide positive operating leverage within Asia, it sounds like it might be tougher, is that fair?</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">That's very fair.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt \u2013 Evercore Partners</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Okay, got it. And then GTS do you still feel that the positive operating leverage is achievable going forward, and obviously SMB its going to be dependent on the market, and how much right sizing you can achieve and how quickly?</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">I think those are all fair comments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt \u2013 Evercore Partners</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Okay, great. And then in terms of the margin outlook that was helpful to hear that kind of stable from where we are today 281-ish, but just on the NII maybe, I missed it, should spread income also holdup or should there still be kind of a natural just lower, because it\u2019s run-off portfolio lower for longer. How should we think about that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Yeah, I think you've got that pegged as well. We're going to continue to see NII under pressure, as we got some of the higher yielding portfolios continuing to run off. And the benefit that we should be getting would be from things like the TruPS redemptions and the lower level of long-term debt as we've replaced a lot of those funding costs with deposits. And if you\u2019ve seen our deposits have a nice steady rise over the last couple of quarters including this quarter, where we\u2019ve been able to grow average deposits and the period deposits at some fairly healthy rates.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt \u2013 Evercore Partners</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Great, thanks guys.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">And Mike Mayo, CLSA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Michael Mayo \u2013 CLSA Ltd.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Hi, follow-up on the margin. You said the margin should be stable at least lower than expected levels, but if the rates stay this low. How much more drag might there be to NII or the corporation as a whole say over the next one or two years?</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Well, if the NIM stays at roughly let\u2019s call it 280, 281 but anyhow and anything like that. We are still looking to see the loan book continuing to grow and so it maybe at a lower NII or lower NIM, but we still see overall nominal margin dollar expansion. I don\u2019t know if I answered your question Michael.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Michael Mayo \u2013 CLSA Ltd.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Let me put it differently, what inning are we in for the pain from this low rate environment, I don\u2019t think you or anybody really expected the 10 year rates to be this low and global rates are also low. So have you adjusted to this or the 10 years stays down to this low level, do you have to revise your revenue expectation?</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Revenue expectation this year, five years from now?</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Michael Mayo \u2013 CLSA Ltd.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Over the next one to two years?</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Well, look I mean unless you know something, I don\u2019t see long-term rates are going up for the next one year or two years, especially from everything I see going on in Europe, but frankly the only place of growth we see is the emerging markets. So our revenue expectations are very realistic that we\u2019re going to have low interest rates, long period of time definitely at the short end, but also at the long end for the next year or two.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Michael Mayo \u2013 CLSA Ltd.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Okay. And then as it relates to emerging markets, I guess, I was a little surprised to that you said on the ground you feel better about emerging markets over the past two months, and you\u2019ve highlighted many secular trends. Do you also feel more positive from a cyclical standpoint?</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">And the cyclical standpoint comes completely from the list of policy actions that have been taken and they\u2019ve not worked their way through yet, and that\u2019s an important perspective to have in mind. The other is that as I said, these emerging markets, both the business people and governments act faster. They try to fine tune their economies to changes. And the big change here was the European picture \u2013 was some of them anticipated not everybody did, and they are doing that as well. And so as I say, we just feel better about the environment. In total, they have a plan. They\u2019re acting on it, and I think we\u2019ll start seeing some results. Obviously, that\u2019s not only true on a secular basis, but we think that\u2019s got a lot of merit in the cyclical basis as well. Having said that, Europe still continues to be an issue and it\u2019s going to be the dominant factor affecting all economies.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Michael Mayo \u2013 CLSA Ltd.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">And then last follow-up, what signal would you rather just answered or John said expect revenue headwinds for Asia, and you\u2019re saying you feel a little bit better about the opportunities. Is the signal that you as a firm, your spending is to be cautious with Asia, don\u2019t mess up, because revenues are slowing or is the signal that hey, don\u2019t miss that on the opportunity, things are better than people realized?</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">Yeah, the signal was very clear. I think what John is saying is that there are some specific issues in Asia at this point in terms of our consumer business, it\u2019s Korea, it\u2019s Japan, it\u2019s investment sales, and that we want to remain cautious with respect to all of those. The signal both John and I are saying is when you cut through those, look at the underlying purchase sales, credit card volumes, what we see on the ground, we like that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Michael Mayo \u2013 CLSA Ltd.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">All right, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">All right, Michael.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">Thank you. And there are no further questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>John Andrews</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">Great. This is John Andrews. As I did the calculations just now, this is my 65<sup>th</sup> quarterly earnings call in an IR capacity. So with a sense of relief that I say, if you have any follow up feel free to call the team, otherwise I look forward to continuing the dialog with a lot of you in the future in my new role. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Vikram S. Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">Thank you, John.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">That concludes today\u2019s conference.

Thank you for joining us today. As you know, we reported earnings of $468 million for the third quarter of 2012. Excluding non-operating item such as the mark on MSSB, CVA and a tax benefit, net income was $3.3 billion and that amounts to $1.06 per share.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Our businesses gained momentum during the quarter while the impact of Citi Holdings lessened. Loans and deposits increased and in all three of our operating businesses, we had positive operating leverage for the third straight quarter. We also had positive operating leverage in Citigroup as a whole.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We gained wallet share again in Investment Banking, while our markets businesses performed very well. Although, Transaction Services has been impacted by spread compression, both trade loans and deposits continued to grow and the pipeline appears to be strong.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Our Institutional businesses showed growth and resilience in the emerging markets, where we have our unique, where our unique footprint gives us a meaningful competitive advantage as we can see by several noteworthy transactions whether they are in China, India, Russia, Mexico or Brazil. Transactions ranging from the Cnooc-Nexen deal to the Santander IPO in Mexico are a reflection of our broad and deep capabilities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Net income increased in Global Consumer Banking, as the drivers for the business remained strong internationally, especially in emerging markets such as Latin America. North America benefited from increased mortgage refinancing. Overall, these earnings highlight the continued execution of our strategy and show the strength of our core businesses and our diversification both by product and geography.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We also made progress winding down Citi Holdings. Last month\u2019s price agreement on MSSB has given us more certainty on our exit. Citi Holdings assets were reduced by $20 billion in the quarter and now total $171 billion or 9% of our balance sheet. Holdings assets are down 31% from the end of third quarter of 2011.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Citi continues to maintain significant liquidity with roughly $400 billion in highly liquid unencumbered assets, primarily cash and government securities. Our Basel III Tier 1 Common Ratio increased to an estimated 8.6% and is among the highest in the industry.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We continue to generate solid returns for Citicorp and Corp/Other, excluding CVA/DVA and the sale of minority interest. Our year-to-date return on allocated tangible common equity is 17.2% and return on Basel III Tier 1 Common on a fully implemented 9.5% basis is 18.7%. For Citigroup as a whole, the year-to-date return on tangible common equity supporting the businesses is 11.8% and return on Basel III on a fully implemented basis is 10.7%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Regarding the macro picture, market sentiment improved during the quarter as a result of the moves made by the ECB and Fed. However, GDP growth remains uneven globally and interest rates remain low. In the U.S., there are promising signs that more robust economic growth is within reach assuming the resolution of the fiscal cliff. Lack of a resolution of the cliff situation will be highly disruptive. The housing market has shown improvement, while capital, labor, energy and technology are all very affordable and in healthy supply.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In Europe the actions by policy makers appear to have set a path for preserving the Europe, but more needs to be done to create deeper market confidence for a better GDP picture.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In the emerging markets, policy makers have been quick to act and we expect growth there to substantially keep outpacing the developed markets. In light of these factors, we\u2019ll continue to manage our risk carefully using the deep knowledge we have of the markets where we do business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">John Gerspach will go over the slides now and then both of us will come back and we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. John?</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Yeah, thank you Vikram and good morning everyone. To start, I would like to highlight some significant items affecting our results this quarter. This will be on slide three.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">First CVA and DVA were negative $776 million pretax and $485 million after tax in the third quarter for a negative impact on EPS of $0.16 per share. Secondly, the loss on Morgan Stanley Smith Barney was $4.7 billion pretax and $2.9 billion after tax for a negative impact on earnings per share of $0.94. And finally, we recorded a tax benefit of $582 million related to the resolution of certain tax audit items which had a positive impact on EPS of $0.19. Adjusting for these items, we earned $3.3 billion in the third quarter or $1.06 per share. Throughout today\u2019s earnings presentation, I will be discussing our results on this basis to provide comparability to prior periods.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In addition, as shown on slide four, there are a few other significant items which are included in our third quarter results. First on the revenue side: In Securities and Banking, we recorded losses on hedges related to accrual loans of $252 million this quarter, driven by credit spread tightening and our lending portfolio compared to gains of $156 million last quarter and over $700 million in the third quarter of last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">On the expense, legal and related expenses remained elevated at over $500 million in the third quarter and repositioning charges were nearly $100 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">On slide five, we showed total Citigroup results. Revenues of $19.4 billion were up 3% from last year while operating expenses of $12.2 billion declined 2%, resulting in positive operating leverage for Citigroup in total.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Credit costs of $2.7 billion were down 20% versus last year. Net credit losses of $4 billion were 12% lower than the prior year including incremental mortgage charge-offs of approximately $635 million in Citi Holdings in the third quarter of this year. These incremental charge-offs were related to new OCC guidance regarding the treatment of mortgage loans where the borrower has gone through chapter 7 bankruptcy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">The vast majority of these charge-offs were related to loans which were current. Substantially all of the incremental $635 million of charge-offs were offset by a related reserve release of approximately $600 million this quarter and so the net impact on earnings was minimal.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Excluding these incremental charge-offs, net credit losses would have been down 26% from last year and the net reserve release in the third quarter would have been roughly $900 million, down from $1.4 billion in the prior year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We earned $3.3 billion of net income in the third quarter or a $1.06 per share, up from $0.84 per share last year on a comparable basis, driven by revenue growth and a decline in both expenses and credit cost. Citigroup, end of period loans grew 3% year-over-year to $658 billion. As loan growth in Citicorp continued to outpace the wind down of Citi Holdings. And deposits grew 11% to $945 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On slide six, we show results for Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Citicorp generated third quarter revenues of $18.4 billion and net income of $4.6 billion. Year-over-year, Citicorp revenues grew 5% and expenses and we maintained positive operating leverage in each of our 3 core businesses. Pre provision net revenues in Citicorp were $8.1 billion for the quarter up 15% from last year. And for the seventh consecutive quarter we grew loans year-over-year in every business in Citicorp.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Total Citicorp loans grew 11% with consumer loans up 5% and corporate loans up 19% Citi Holdings had revenues of $971 million and a net loss of $679 million. Citi Holdings ended the quarter with a $171 billion of assets down $20 billion during the quarter and $76 billion or $31% year-over-year. At quarter end Citi Holdings accounted for 9% of total Citigroup assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On slide seven we show a nine quarter trend for Citicorp\u2019s results. As I noted Citicorp's revenues of $18.4 billion were 5% higher than last year and expenses of $10.3 billion were 2% lower year-over-year. Citicorp's net credit losses of $2.2 billion declined 17% from last year driven by improvement in North America cards and the net loan loss reserve release in Citicorp was $696 million down from $887 million last year. This reflected a significant decline in the net reserve release in North America cards, partially offset by a reserve release in the corporate portfolio. Earnings before taxes of $6.6 billion grew 25% versus last year driven by higher revenues lower operating expenses and lower credit losses partially offset by a lower net reserve release.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On slide eight, we show Citicorp's pretax earnings by business excluding the impact of loan loss reserves. On a trailing 12 month basis earnings grew to $20.2 billion in the third quarter driven by strong results in Consumer Banking and Securities and Banking.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On slide nine, we show Citicorp's results for the first nine months of the year. Revenues of $55.6 billion grew 4% from the prior year, while expenses declined 1% generating double digit growth in operating margin. At the same time net credit losses improved significantly. Pretax earnings before the impact of loan loss reserves were $17.9 billion in the first nine months of the year or 34% higher than last year, reflecting the combination of positive operating leverage in each of our businesses as well as improved credit.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Slide 10, shows the results for North America Consumer Banking. Total revenues of $5.4 billion were up 6% versus last year largely driven by higher gains on sales of mortgage loans total card revenues declined 4% year-over-year. In branded cards both average loans and spreads declined year-over-year reflecting consumer deleveraging and the continued impact of the look back provisions of the Card Act. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In Retail Services, net interest revenues were stable year-over-year while non-interest revenues declined driven by improving credit and its impact on contractual partner payments. On a sequential basis however card revenues grew 5% as average loan stabilized and spreads improved in both portfolios.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Total operating expenses of $2.5 billion were up 2% year-over-year primarily due to higher retail channel mortgage volumes. Credit cost of $852 million declined modestly year-over-year and were up 19% sequentially.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Net credit losses continued to decline by 27% year-over-year to $1.4 billion driven by improvement in cards however the net loan loss reserve release was significantly lower than prior periods at $518 million this quarter compared to $956 million in the prior year and $814 million last quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Earnings before tax excluding the impact of loan loss reserves nearly doubled from last year to $1.6 billion. Overall, we continued to see progress in our North America consumer franchise. Average deposits grew for the sixth consecutive quarter; up 6% year-over-year, including double digit growth in checking account balances. In branded cards, accounts also grew for the sixth consecutive quarter, up 4% year-over-year and for both card portfolios, net credit margins continue to expand year-over-year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On slide 11, we show results for international consumer banking in constant dollars. On this basis, both revenues and expenses grew 3% year-over-year in the third quarter. Latin America achieved positive operating leverage for the fourth consecutive quarter with revenue growth of 7% and flat expenses versus last year and EMEA achieved positive operating leverage as well. Asia however, had negative operating leverage for the quarter with revenues down 2% and expenses up 8% in constant dollars, which I\u2019ll discuss more in a minute.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Despite some headwinds, most drivers for International Consumer Banking continued to grow in the third quarter, both year-over-year and sequentially. Average loans grew 10% from last year and 2% sequentially. Average deposits grew 4% year-over-year and 1% sequentially, and both card purchase sales and investment sales also grew versus the prior period.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Credit costs were $722 million in the third quarter, up 8% from last year as net credit losses grew 6% due to loan growth and there was no material loan loss reserve release this quarter. Earnings before tax, excluding the impact of loan loss reserves were nearly flat year-over-year at $1.1 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On slide 12, we show our Asia Consumer results in more detail. First on revenues: Investment sales revenues recovered from the second quarter. However, they remain modestly lower than last year and our total deposit and lending revenues including cards are down modestly from both periods.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Similar to last quarter, most of the pressure on our Retail Banking Business continued to be seen in Korea and Japan. Korea, in particular, reflects the continued impact of regulatory changes, including the rate caps and other initiatives intended to slow the growth of consumer credit in that market.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">At the same time, spreads in several countries have compressed, reflecting a decline in market interest rates. Despite these headwinds, our franchise in Asia remained strong and we continue to grow volumes in the third quarter, including average deposits, average retail loans and average card loans.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">The cost associated with sustaining this volume growth drove a significant portion of the expense increase in the business, both year-over-year and versus last quarter. Third quarter expenses also included nearly $20 million of repositioning charges in Korea as we began to rationalize our distribution network and refocus our client segmentation. While these changes were prompted by the new regulatory environment in Korea, they also simplify the business and align our Korea franchise more closely with the urban-based global strategy we employ in most other markets. We expect to incur additional repositioning charges in the fourth quarter to complete this effort.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Importantly, our overall outlook for Asia remains positive and we currently believe that in this environment we can grow revenues from our third quarter base at an annual rate of 4% to 6% with a return to positive operating leverage in 2013.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Slide 13 shows our International Consumer Credit trends, which generally remained stable in the third quarter. For total International Consumer Banking, the NCL rate remained below 2% and 90 plus day delinquencies were stable at just above 90 basis points.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">In Asia, the NCL rate increased slightly from the first and second quarters each of which benefited from higher recoveries while delinquencies improved slightly. In Latin America, both the NCL rate and delinquencies remained fairly stable. And in EMEA, the sequential increase in the NCL rate in the third quarter reflects the impact of a recovery in the prior quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Slide 14 shows our Securities and Banking business. Revenues of $5.6 billion grew 15% versus last year and were up 7% from the prior quarter. Investment banking revenues of $926 billion grew 26% from the prior year on stronger debt and equity underwriting activity and higher M&amp;A revenues, while the sequential growth of 8% was driven by debt underwriting. Overall, our wallet share in Investment Banking, continue to improve year-to-date in all major products.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Equity market revenues of $510 million grew 76% from last year driven by the absence of proprietary trading losses in the prior year as well as better derivatives performance. Sequentially, equity market revenues were down 7% on lower market volumes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Fixed income market revenues of $3.7 billion grew 63% from last year driven by significantly higher revenues in credit related and securitized products, as well as strong performance in rates and currencies. Sequentially, fixed income revenues were up 31% on strong results across all major products.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Lending revenues, excluding the impact of gains and losses on hedges related to the accrual loans were $445 million in the third quarter, up 35% from last year, on higher loan volumes and improved spreads and down slightly sequentially as higher volumes were offset by the absence of gains of asset sales in the prior quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Total operating expenses of $3.5 billion were down 3% from last year driven by efficiency savings. Credit costs were a benefit of $73 million in the third quarter and net income grew 67% year-over-year to $1.6 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Moving to Transaction Services on slide by 15; revenues of $2.7 billion were down 2% from last year on a reported basis and up 1% in constant dollars as continued growth in Treasury and Trade Solutions was mostly offset by a decline in Securities and Fund Services.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Treasury and Trade solutions was up 4% year-over-year in constant dollars driven by continued growth in deposits and trade loans partially offset by ongoing spread compression.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Securities and Fund Services revenues declined 8% in constant dollars on lower settlement volumes. The drivers for Transaction Services continue to show strong momentum. End of period trade loans were up over 30% from the prior year and average deposits were up 17% both in constant dollars. Expenses of $1.4 billion were down 5% versus last year driven by efficiency savings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Slide 16 shows Citi Holdings assets. We ended the quarter with $171 billion in Citi Holdings assets or roughly 9% of total Citigroup assets. The $20 billion reduction in third quarter reflected a $12 billion decline in assets related to Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, $4 billion of other assets sales, $3 billion of net pay downs and roughly $1 billion of cost of credit.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On slide 17, we showed Citi Holding's financial results for the quarter. Revenues in brokerage and asset management were negative $120 million this quarter versus $55 million last year due to a lower equity contribution from Morgan Stanley Smith Barney and lower private equity marks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">In Local Consumer Lending, revenues were down 15% versus last year to $1.1 billion, primarily due to declining loan balances. In the special asset pool, revenues were negative 13 million in third quarter compared to negative $277 million last year, driven in part by lower funding cost as well as an improvement in asset marks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Citi Holdings expenses were down 21% year-over-year to $1.2 billion, mainly due to declining assets. Credit costs were down 26% year-over-year to $1.2 billion. Total net credit losses were $1.8 billion, including the $635 million of the incremental mortgage charge-offs I described earlier. Excluding these incremental charge-offs, net credit losses in Citi Holding would have declined 38% year-over-year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">As I mentioned, substantially all of the incremental charge-offs were offset by a reserve release of approximately $600 million, so the impact on earnings was minimal. In total, we released $830 million of net loan loss reserves in Citi Holdings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">The net loss in Citi Holdings improved to $679 million in the third quarter however, this included a tax benefit of nearly $200 million related to the sale of certain assets in the special asset pool.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Looking at the past five quarters of Citi Holdings results on slide 18, Rep &amp; Warranty reserve bills and legal and related costs continue to weigh on Citi Holdings in the third quarter. These costs have been difficult to predict and we continue to work to put these issues behind us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On an operating basis however, excluding these items, we maintained a modest positive operating margin in the third quarter and our goal is to continue to generate positive margin although there may be quarter-to-quarter fluctuations arising from periodic gains or losses as we continue to wind down the assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Credit trends also remained favorable this quarter, with adjusted net credit losses of $1.2 billion, declining 12% quarter-over-quarter and mortgage losses comprising over [17%] of the total. We ended the quarter with $8.5 billion of loan loss reserves allocated to North America mortgage loans in Citi Holdings or 30 months or coverage.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">The decline in North America mortgage reserves from $9.4 billion last quarter to $8.5 billion reflected the $600 million reserve release related to the incremental charge-offs as well as asset sales during the quarter. We continue to watch the housing market carefully and have taken note of some recent indications that the market may be stabilizing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On slide 19 we show mortgage loan and adjusted net credit loss trends over the past two years. Since the third quarter of 2010 we have reduced the North America mortgage loans in Citi holdings by nearly 30% driven by $20 billion of pay-downs, $9 billion of assets sales and $9 billion of net losses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Of the $9 billion of asset sales over the past two year, approximately 6 billion have been delinquent loans, including the sale of nearly $750 million in delinquent loans in the third quarter. We have also significantly reduced the quarterly net credit losses, on the portfolio, down nearly 40% to $850 million in the third quarter even while $40 million to $45 million of losses were accelerated into each of the second and third quarters of this year as a result of actions we are taking to fulfill our commitments onto the national mortgage settlement.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Delinquency trends remained favorable through the third quarter with 90 plus day delinquencies improving in both residential first mortgages and home equity loans. Assuming no material deterioration of the economic environment here in the U.S., the net credit losses on these portfolios should generally decline overtime as the portfolio continues to shrink.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Slide 20, shows the results for Corporate/Other. Revenues of $33 million were down from the prior year driven by the impact of hedging activities and lower investment yields. Expenses of $764 million were 47% higher versus last year mainly due to higher legal and related expenses as well as incremental firm wide marketing expenses in the third quarter. Assets of $302 billion included approximately $116 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $130 billion of liquid available for sales securities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Turning to totaled Citigroup expenses on slide 21 total operating expenses of $12.2 billion in the third quarter were 2% lower than last year while core operating expenses excluding legal and related cost and repositioning charges declined 1% in constant dollars to $11.6 billion this core operating expense number is marginally higher than our expectation of a $11.5 billion for the quarter, driven by greater than expected volumes in Consumer Banking.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">As we look to the fourth quarter, we currently believe our core operating expenses should remain roughly in line with the third quarter levels. Additionally, we expect to continue to incur elevated legal and related expenses and repositioning cost in the fourth quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">On slide 22, we show our key capital metrics under Basel III our estimated Tier I common ratio as of the third quarter was 8.6% up from 7.9% in the second quarter. More than half of the increase was driven by operating earnings. Roughly 15 basis points came from the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney transaction, roughly 8 basis points was due to lower risk weighted assets and the remainder was driven by changes in other comprehensive income and other items.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">On Basel I, Tier 1 common ratio remained flat as of the third quarter at 12.7% adjusting for the final market risk ruled that will be effective in January 2013. Our Basel I Tier 1 common ratio would be approximately 11.5% slide 23 shows the components of our Basel I and estimated Basel III capital ratios. As of the third quarter, our Tier 1 Common Capital under Basel I was $124 billion compared to an estimated $106 billion under Basel III.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Turning to the denominator, our total risk weighted assets under Basel III were an estimated $1.2 trillion or 27% higher versus Basel I. The increase from Basel I to Basel III remained very favorable for Citicorp and Corp/Other with an increase of only 15%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Slide 24 shows our returns on capital for the first nine months of 2012. On the lower left, we show our average tangible common equity for the period, split between the amount of TCE, which supports our deferred tax assets and that which is employed by our businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">A significant amount of our deferred tax asset is deducted from regulatory capital under Basel III and therefore, we are required to have a higher absolute level of TCE then would otherwise be needed to support our income generating businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">The $40 billion of TCE that must be retained to support the DTA earns a return through the utilization of this specific asset rather than from the income produced by our businesses. In other words, only a $110 billion of our TCE is employed in our income producing operations. On this basis, Citigroup earned nearly a 12% return on the tangible common equity supporting our operating businesses in the first nine months of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Turning to regulatory capital, if we assume Tier 1 common capital levels of 9.5% of Basel III risk weighted assets across each business. The return on Basel III capital for Citigroup would have been an estimated 10.7% in the first nine months of the year, including an 18.7% return for our core businesses in Citicorp plus Corporate/Other.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Now, let me close with a few comments about the outlook. First Global Consumer Banking; in North America, revenues continue to benefit from strong mortgage refinancing activity which we currently expect will continue into at least the early part of next year. However, card revenues remain under pressure with declining average loan balances driven by continued consumer deleveraging.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Additionally, while net credit losses are likely to improve modestly from current levels, we expect loan loss reserve releases to continue to decline in North America as delinquency trends have stabilized in the card business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">In Latin America, we continue to see strong growth in revenues and volumes driven by market growth and the strength of our franchise in Mexico. Overall, credit quality remained stable in the third quarter and we believe this trend will continue.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">In Asia, as we discussed earlier, consumer revenue growth has slowed, primarily reflecting headwinds in Korea and Japan. In response to regulatory changes in Korea, we are repositioning that business. We took nearly $20 million of related charges in the third quarter and we expect to incur additional repositioning costs in the fourth quarter to complete the effort. Our overall outlook remains positive in Asia however, as volumes continued to grow in the third quarter. As I noted, we currently believe that in this environment we can grow revenues from our third quarter base at an annual rate of 4% to 6% with a return to positive operating leverage in 2013.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Transaction Services continue to show positive operating leverage in the third quarter, although overall revenues were down slightly year-over-year reflecting ongoing spread compression, lower settlement volumes and the impact of FX. We continue to believe we can absorb the headwind of a low interest rate environment with additional volumes and new mandates and while our growth in trade assets slowed in the third quarter reflecting the market environment, we continue to be well positioned to gain market share in that business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Securities and Banking results were very strong in the third quarter, as a more favorable market environment offset the impact of seasonally slower volumes for many businesses. The strength of our fixed income franchise in particular was evident this quarter with momentum across all products.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">In Equities, our performance continues to demonstrate that the issues of the second half of 2011 are behind us, although we will likely continue to experience low levels of client activity in this macro environment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And finally, we continue to see momentum in Investment Banking with wallet share gains in every major product. Importantly, we remain disciplined on expenses in securities and banking with a continued focus on operating at the right size for the opportunities we see in the market.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">In Holdings, the wind down of assets will continue, although likely at a slower pace than the third quarter and our primary focus remains the mortgage portfolio. We continue to watch the mortgage market closely and while we have noted signs that the housing market may have stabilized, we would like more clarity on economic trends in the U.S. before we can conclude that the housing recovery is sustainable. In the meantime, we are focused on reducing the loan portfolio, mitigating risk and working through the rep and warranty and other issues associated with that business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Overall, while market sentiment improved in the third quarter benefiting certain of our businesses, the overall macro environment including slowing GDP growth in certain countries and a persistent low rate environment remains an overhang for now. We continue to make progress however in the third quarter and we remain optimistic about our prospects given our client franchise and unique mix of businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Vikram and I will now be happy to answer your questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p8\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Nomura.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">First a quick one on risk weighted assets; I know there has been no real change the last four or five quarters. Could you talk through some of the moving parts, the plusses and minuses and what you think might happen over say the next four or five quarters?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Glenn, are you focused on the risk weighted assets on a Basel I or Basel III basis or\u2026?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Well, in the slide you gave us Basel I, so I guess I\u2019ll stay with Basel I, just because I noticed\u2026.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So we have also given you Basel III at least you know on slide 23. So you know the Basel I risk weighted assets, as you know they are not necessarily risk sensitive, they are really linked to the overall size of the GAAP balance sheet and so with the overall GAAP balance sheet remaining fairly stable, you are not going to get a great deal of up or down movement in the Basel I assets. If you look at Basel III, I think what you see there is overtime continued reductions in the Basel III risk weighted assets as the rate of risk asset decline in holdings, outpaces any growth that we would otherwise see in Citicorp. And I think you see that reflected in the difference between the two multipliers, where you're looking at the multiplier from Basel I to Basel III for Citicorp being about 115%, where as the Holdings risk weighted assets are close to 1.9%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">That makes sense. Okay, that leads to the next one on, I think the comments just now in your outlook was you need sustainable housing improvement to see maybe further releases. Does that mean the releases this quarter were driven by the housing improvement that we've seen and then that feeds in to the model and what spits out a lower loss rate over the life of those loans.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yeah, let me be specific about the mortgage reserve releases that we had in this quarter. there was roughly $600 million that was specific related to the incremental charge-offs that we had to take on the new OCC guidance related to borrowers that had gone through Chapter 7 bankruptcies.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So that is merely, we were forced to recognize higher NCLs. We had reserves established against those assets. And so we released those reserves. The other change has to do with, as I mentioned, we sold $750 million worth of mortgage loans in the quarter. And so therefore we took down the reserves that were set aside against those specific loans. So both reserve releases were very specific in nature.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Got it. I appreciate that. And then on page 10 of the supplement, there -- inside North American Consumer Banking, there is a net servicing and gain on sale I'm just thinking out loud, this is not necessarily this quarter, but it's over the last four quarters, you've seen a big pickup and gain on sale and obviously that's, we've seen that trend in the market, but I'm curious, it happens when no big change in mortgage originations or the servicing portfolio. Is that strictly gain on sale and can we continue to operate at that level?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">You know, I think that that's one of the big question facing a lot of institutions at this point in time, as far as the, the ongoing pace of mortgage originations, quarter-on-quarter we definitely saw an increase in our originations, but a lot of that is clearly being driven by mortgage refi\u2019s. So, as I mentioned, we can see the mortgage refi\u2019s continuing fairly strongly into at least the beginning part of next year, but that's about as far as I'm willing to go at this point in time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay, one last very quick is the repurchase claims were down 25%. Do you feel like you've been through most of the pipeline, it's definitely; it's a standout versus your peers? I'm just curious on how you feel on that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">The, you know, when you take a look at the repurchase claim activity, I'd say that we're seeing, we certainly saw in this quarter increased activity on the part of Freddie Mac, you know, I'd say that it's a little difficult to gauge the overall level of claim activity between Fannie and Freddie and so, I would say it's still a little bit volatile in that area and I wouldn't draw any conclusions as yet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay, thanks for all your help. I appreciate it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Not a problem, Glenn.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question will come from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Hey, John; just on the deposits, you guys were up $30 billion on a purine basis sequentially. Can you talk about the drivers, if you think that was sort of end of the quarter issue, or if that's pretty sticky and if that is somewhat sustainable, can we expect to see the long term debt footprint come down or accelerate given that deposit growth which helps your margin. I know you don't like to talk about your margin but your margin was up this quarter. So maybe you could talk about that interaction?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. Let me try to redress your first question, regarding deposits, which again as you know they were up fairly, fairly strongly being $30 billion quarter-over-quarter, I would say that roughly you know almost 40% to 50% of that increase I would put on episodic quarter and deposits.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So I wouldn't read that into a continuing trend, however when we do look at each of our businesses whether they be transaction services on the corporate side or the consumer businesses, we do continue to see strong momentum in our deposit gathering activities, particularly and what we would refer to this core operating deposits. So the deposit franchise is certainly strong but it was impacted by some episodic growth at quarter end.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay, fair. And could you disclose or give us the benefit from the trust preferred buyback on the margin and if we can expect to see at least some additional benefit as you pulled back your long term debt footprint?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yeah. If you recall at the end of last quarter, the guidance \u2013 in last quarter our NIM I think was 281 basis points and the guidance that I gave last quarter, which incorporated the retirement of the troughs would be that I would expect you know net interest margin to be flattish perhaps plus or minus 2 or 3 basis points. So we actually came in a little bit higher than the upper end of my range we came in about 2 basis points higher than that and that's primarily being driven by lower cost of deposits than -- what I would have had built into the earlier guidance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay thanks and one last question switching up on fixed income, you guys -- we only have one other comparison but you guys did pretty well relative to one of your other peers. Is it a function of mix in terms of your global footprint or is it -- do you think there is some evidence of market share gains or is it just hard to say at this point?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">It's a little hard for me to say that we've had -- to pin market share gains quarter to quarter I will say that I do think our results really demonstrate the diversity of our franchise both from a product offering as well as from a geographic distribution and our model really is focused on serving our core customers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay that's it from me. Thanks, John. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Hi thanks for taking my question quick one first on the REPO cost and we were just sort of talking about the funding cost, John, and I know you mentioned about deposit costs coming down. But it also looked like the REPO line in average balance sheet dropped pretty significantly was that due to some sort of change in the funding portfolio there reduction in tenor or something like that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Our tenors has been fairly constant; I think we talked in various calls over the course of the last year is to how we either actually extended some of our REPO tenors I guess going back six to nine months ago. So I wouldn\u2019t say that there was any impact this quarter on the extension of tenors and you know our repo line tends to move in accordance with our overall customer related business, so I wouldn't draw too much into what's going on, on the repo one.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. So then, switching gears a little bit on credit and in charge-offs; is there a home price sensitivity for you guys in the charge-off number and could you maybe help us out a little bit on understanding there and obviously I would think it would be, is there a difference when we think about the LCL book versus the rest of it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Well, I would say that all mortgage charge-off activity has got an element of HPI sensitivity built into it, just based upon the mechanics of what you go through in order to recognize the losses. So you know, when a loan gets to 188 days past due, you take your initial write-down, which of course is influenced by what you think the realizable value of that property is going to be. So there is an HPI component in that charge-off.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Then as the loan stays on your books and with the extension of the foreclosure timeline, this is becoming an increasingly longer period of time, you need to go back, you know, two or three times a year and reassess where you have that property marked against what your new estimates as far as realize-ability would be and of course that is heavily influenced by the expectation of HPI.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So when it comes to those severity type of losses, especially I\u2019ll call it the secondary, you know the catch up severity losses they are on the subsequent writedowns, there we\u2019ve seen some real improvement, the overall volume of subsequent writedowns last year was probably running in the $60 million a quarter, this quarter it dropped down closer to $50 million, a lot of that being driven by volume related, we just have more inventory in our book, but importantly you know at least what I\u2019m seeing is that, the average subsequent writedown for severity factors year-over-year has probably dropped by a third for each of the properties. So you\u2019re starting to see some level of that recovery of HPI enter into the numbers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yeah, sounds like it; while around LCL and taking a slightly different tact, when you think about the negative carry that you guys have there, the negative spread. How much rate sensitivity is there in that LCL business and I mean, I know that, I think in your disclosures you indicated about a third of your consumer loans float. How many of those were in LCL and how much of a function of the negative spread might be due to low interest rates?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yeah well, a lot of that is obviously is due to low interest rates, but don\u2019t forget a lot of that LCL portfolio is in our mortgage business. The LCL, we break that out for you on slide 16, the LCL portfolio is about $134 billion and of that $95 billion of the $134 billion are U.S. residential mortgages in holdings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yeah.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">There is not a lot of incremental yield that we\u2019re going to get on that portfolio, so it is really dependent on cost of funds, it\u2019s highly rate sensitive from a cost of funds point of view.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So there is not a lot of IO in that mortgage?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">There certainly isn't a lot of IO that is currently repriced, those resets on the IO\u2019s normally have got, you know they are periodic and so you will catch up on some of those, but it\u2019s highly rate sensitive I would say at this point in time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Just on the funding cost side rather than the asset side?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Exactly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. So then secondly, isn't a big factor there either for it, okay fair enough. And then last one from me, on the LCL business of the second lien mortgages, the HELOC\u2019s, how many of those have started to amortize at this point, is there any sense we can get on that front?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I don't have that I front of me, I can tell you that of the HELOC portfolio, the bigger, we have more targeted to reprice and to reset in beginning of like 2015. So we\u2019re getting some level of amortization right now, but the bigger step function really starts in 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question will come from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Great, thanks. And John you had kind of mentioned some degree of general optimism about kind of seeing growth restart out of the emerging markets. Can you talk a little bit about where you would like to see it, which counties and regions and how are you going to see it, how that patterns are going to shake out over the next couple of quarters?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I am not sure I recall saying that it was going to restart; we are seeing growth in the emerging markets today. Vikram I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve got\u2026\u2026\u2026</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Vikram Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yeah, I think we can break it on variety of different ways Moshe. Obviously, we think that Mexico is extremely well poised for growth; we have seen that in our numbers; I was just there not too long ago and with the leadership change there in addition to prospects for reforms and what you are seeing on the ground that\u2019s a high spot definitely. We don\u2019t have much of a retail business or large business in Brazil, so that\u2019s less relevant to us. But we are seeing that in Colombia; we are seeing that in Peru, we are seeing that in Chile, so if you want to think about it, the Western Coast of Latin America is something we\u2019re quite constructive on in terms of growth.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">When you get to Asia, as John said, for us there really have been two issues, one is the regulatory changes in Korea which have driven the restructuring of the business and the charge we took there and I think that\u2019s something that\u2019s going to continue over the next quarter at least as John said and that business kind of grow in line with Korea growing beyond that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">But more generally speaking, when you look at the underlying drivers in our consumer businesses, they continue to do well and they continue to do well in our businesses across Hong Kong, Singapore, India, Southeast Asia, all across there and so based on all the policy decisions that we have seen being taken in these countries and based on my having been there multiple times in the last couple of months and based on what we're seeing in our own volumes, we think that it's going to lead to revenue growth just the way that John talked about it for next year from here about 4% to 6%. That's our current thinking.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So we're very much aligned with that growth pattern. Don\u2019t forget as well that the emerging markets to us are not only consumer, they run across our entire business line and one place where we really saw it this quarter was in our Securities and Banking business. There's a lot more activity, lot more activity even on the retail side on the asset sale side but across the board, there is a lot of activity going on in Asia as they build up their capital base, but [also] Asia looks to the western world for acquisitions and you saw that with Softbank-Sprint. We're on the Sprint side on that one as an example. So when you look at the entire diversified portfolio, what we have, we think that the emerging markets are going to be a bright spot going forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Great thanks, just on a different topic. John, you did say again that you expected slower draw down of the assets out of Citi Holdings and yet, by the same token, you also referenced that the mortgage business to the extent there's improvement in the housing market, you could start to accelerate sales you know, and use the reserve like you did a little bit of this quarter. Could you -- I mean, how would that take shape in terms of what it mean for the balances in the Local Lending business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">When you take a look at the sales activity, this quarter we were able to conclude $750 million worth of sales. Even if in a favorable market, with buyers that had access to liquidity, if we double that, you'd be looking at $1.5 billion of sales. It's still not likely to be at some sort of an amount that is going to significantly drive the rapid reduction in the real estate loan portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And just a last one from me is that, the branded cards particularly in North America still a little bit sluggish in terms of the overall volume and balances, revenue was better. But what are there any things you can highlight about the steps you're taking to try and kind of jump-start that a little bit?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yeah, I'm not quite sure, you're going to see a loan growth in anybody's portfolio, because, there still is certainly an element of consumer deleveraging going on, I think we do see pockets that consumers are spending, now, those products in our consumer portfolio where we have already worked through the repositioning of the product, most of our rewards programs for instance, we are now seeing, purchase sales growth year-over-year. But, we're working through the entire portfolio at this point in time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So, again that's probably something, don't forget we were a year late than everyone else in reprising the portfolio. And so, we're still working our way through repositioning each one of our products, simplifying our product offering, retargeting the product offering and re-enhancing as you were the rewards aspect of each of the products.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Thanks. Thanks for the answer.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So we're beginning to see it. Okay?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question will come from the line of Jason Goldberg with Barclays.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Jason Goldberg - Barclays</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Thanks. John, I thought you hit on the kind of TCE supporting the DTA was interesting. Can we talk about in terms of the timeframe of which we can [sense] to that DTA come down and as that TCE, I guess, getting redeployed into obviously much more profitable areas?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Well, I think as we've said before the reduction of DTA is going to be a multiyear project and so certainly is going to take a multiyear timeframe. We had indicated earlier this year that we didn't expect the DTA to come down this year. And clearly with some other things we talked about earlier the loss on the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney JV that has actually caused the DTA to go up.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So once we began to see, I think a better U.S. economic environment you'll see growth in our U.S. earnings and at that point in time, the DTA will come down. But again as it starts to come down, it will come down in smaller increments, it's not going to be coming down in big chunks of $8 billion to $10 billion, it will come down related to the size of our North America income.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So you need to think about it coming down almost as a pay-down of an annuity over several years, and I'm not going to give you a range right now but lower single digits per year would be, I think the best way to think about it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Jason Goldberg - Barclays</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I guess ultimately if you end of releasing reserves tied to Citi Holdings, the mortgage portfolio, would that I guess help the utilization of it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">That would definitely have an impact on it, yes. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Jason Goldberg - Barclays</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay, and then just lastly remind us where is the DTA sits at Q3?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yeah, Q3 we ended with the DTA at $53.3 billion and if you think about you close the second quarter DTA was $51 billion so we got a $2.3 billion increase and you know you basically look at the tax reserve release that we had that has added $600 million to the balance Morgan Stanley Smith Barney that loss added $1.8 billion to the balance. We had about $200 million worth of FX impact on the balance and you CVA added about $200 million to the balance as well so overall, the combination of our operations and the OCI for the quarter brought it down by about $0.5 billion but you know clearly the pressure was on the upside of this quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Jason Goldberg - Barclays</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Got it, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Not a problem.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question will come from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Just a follow up on some of the NIM discussion, sorry if I missed it but did you provide an outlook for the net interest margin from here?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">No. I don't think I did.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Do you care to?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I'm sorry I was just playing with you. We're at about 286 right now and I would say I still see that you know yields are going through loan yields and investment yields are going to remain under pressure you know clearly out into the fourth quarter. And it will get some offset to that by what I think will be continued improvement in our cost of funds but you know as a result of those two factors I think we'll likely see a small reduction in our NIM in the fourth quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">You know, so I would say it's probably going to be in the upper band of the previous range that would have given you, so say somewhere in the say 282 to 284, so just down a couple of basis points from where we are in the third quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. And I guess just a bigger picture; as we think about the impact of QE3 on banks, should we think about Citi having a less risk since you're not a big agency RMBS buyer or could there be some spillover affects that maybe we're not thinking about globally here?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Vikram Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yeah, that\u2019s a tough one to work through, obviously to the extent that we\u2019re smaller part of the mortgage business, the direct impact is likely to be lower. Having said that, I think the real question to me of QE3 is sort of a bridge to the cliff and we got to get through the cliff on the other side and that could start creating kind of growth that we think is really pent-up in the U.S. and if that happens, anything that happens on the other side of QE3 will be married with a stronger growth rate and better economy, so again, very difficult to predict. In any case, generally a stronger economy is a good thing for everybody, but for us particularly, given that about half of what we do is in the emerging markets stronger growth and that part of the world probably dominates for a period of time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I guess specifically within your securities portfolio, I mean again, thinking if you don have a lot of agency RMBS; as we look across all the other asset class that you\u2019ve been buying; it's a little hard for us to track externally, you know, have you seen as much spread compression there in terms of your reinvestment rates, you know, what they are now versus what they were say in 2Q?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yeah, we\u2019ve certainly seeing the impact of spread compression on the investment portfolio and it was one of the factors that I\u2019ve put into my answer to the question as far as forward NIM guidance. I continue to see the fact that we will have spread pressure, yield pressure on both loans as well as investment securities into the fourth quarter, I don\u2019t see that abating.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay, just switching gears here; we\u2019re a couple of quarters into HARP, I think there has been some changes to the FHA refi fees, and as you think about that $95 billion of mortgages you have and I realize some of that second lien, but are there any that could be HARP-ed or refi-ed, I mean do you literally go kind of loan-by-loan and proactively try and refi or have you done that or think about doing that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yes. We, I mean we are refi-ing the loans that are eligible to be refi-ed, we\u2019ve got, a lot of the portfolio has already gone through HAMP, that portion of the portfolio that was not eligible for a HAMP, we\u2019re putting through HARP, so we\u2019re working our way through the portfolio as you put it literally on a loan-by-loan basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And do you have any sense of how much of, the $60 billion of first could be HARP-ed; I mean obviously it takes time to figure it out and reach the people?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I can\u2019t tell you how we\u2019re progressing on the HARP-ing of the U.S. mortgage portfolio and holdings, I am sorry.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">A couple of questions; one on [FIC] line; I guess I am just trying to understand how much of the FIC line was a function of marks that you had obviously several asset classes that are increased in value during the quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">No, there is not a lot of marks that are impacting the FIC line; it\u2019s not like that it will suddenly had a position that we just took a big mark on and it\u2019s going to disappear, it really is being driven by client volume. As I\u2019ve said, I came and if I sit on this call or some other call, overall I think the market that we encountered in the third quarter was an overall better market; volumes may have been down slightly, but certainly compared to other markets that we saw last year, we weren\u2019t facing a market where every customer was moving in the same direction at the same time. And so that certainly puts you in a better position from a revenue generating capacity; but the business that we\u2019re running is really based on client flows.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. So you also have in the portfolios some, in the past some non-agency RMBS assets that appreciated significantly in value this past quarter, would you have take any gains on this, would you have sold any of that and realized some benefit with that as flow through any of the FIC line or the Corporate/Other line?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I am not aware of any outsized gains Betsy that would have impacted the FIC line at all.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And when it comes to Corporate/Other, almost everything that we have in Corporate/Other is an AFS security. So the extent that there were any gains on the securities that we have got in Corp/Other it would really be flowing into OCI.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And then, separately on the NIM outlook that you discussed a little bit ago, clearly one of the benefits of the NIM that you had this quarter was the reduction in your long term debt, right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yeah. As I said, that was baked into the guidance that we would have provided you last quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So I think you have got about $25 billion in long term debt coming due over the next couple of years; any color on how much of that debt you will be refi-ing versus rolling off?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">We have actually, we certainly haven\u2019t gone out a couple of years Betsy, but since I think that when we have -- we certainly we are indicating that this year we would only expect to refinance something less than $15 billion to $20 billion of the long term debt that was coming due and we are on-track to be in the lower end of that range at this point in time. We haven\u2019t given any guidance yet out to what you might do in 2013.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay; and one of the reasons asking the question is there is some discussion to be amongst some fixed income investors around the requirements that after you have seen others might have for larger institutions talking about how much senior debt through equity as a percentage of assets; banks might need you know the bailing debt and I mean then they are still bearing the plusses at for 3% senior debt through equity, I mean it sounds like the idea haven\u2019t really gone away and wondering if that factoring into your thought process on how much debt you are going to roll versus not?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">We still have, but I think take a look at our overall capital structure; we have got a reasonable amount of long term debt remaining. I think we are all trying to await some guidance on many of these issues and you know the topic that you are really getting into is really one that\u2019s being driven by the Title II approach to recovery and resolution. So that\u2019s something that's being work through as far as what level of debt you would need. Certainly, the levels of debt that we've got in our forward planning would be such that again we think that we would be writing [lock] step was what we think the requirement of that Title II resolution regime would be.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Next question will come from the line of Ed Najarian with ISI Group.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Ed Najarian - ISI Group</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So, in the last couple of calls you've outlined the ROEs coming from Corp being quite high. And then that obviously gets dragged down by Holdings. So it kind of begs the question, and it's sort of outlined on page 18 of the slide deck where you go through the operating cost of Holdings and especially breaking them in to core number and then legal related number.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Any sense of how fast, just thinking about the next couple of years, we can get those operating cost out of Holdings. You got the assets coming down nicely but obviously the markets looking for those operating cost to come down in conjunction with that so that we can get closer to the core profitability of Corp. So could you give us a sense of that in any way?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Yeah, the Holdings, I think that we've been pretty true to what we said which was that we would bring down the operating expenses in Holdings in relation to the reduction in assets. Now, if you focus on the operating expenses in Holdings, I mean obviously Holdings is also being impacted by higher amounts of legal and related, put that off to the side. So let's just focus on the billion dollars or so of operating expenses that are in Holdings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">If you look at in total right now, those operating expenses are running about 2.3% of the assets this quarter and that's basically flat to what they would have been last quarter, so that's, and it's up just slightly from 2.2% in the fourth quarter of last year. So again, we're pretty much on spot as far as having the operating expenses come down in relation to the assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Now, at this point in time though, what's going to happen is that, that operating expenses they're going to be impacted now by the mix of the portfolio, the portfolio was shrunk so much that, you can now look at it, at almost very bite sized chunks. Obviously the specialized asset pool -- assets have the absolute lowest amount of operating expenses associated with them, they're running at about 0.5% or so of assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So to the extent we can drive down SAP, we drive down the SAP assets but we don't necessarily relieve a lot of the operating expenses. For us, it's really the operating expenses get heavily focused into the LCL assets and the LCL assets are running at a rate that is certainly higher than the average of 2.3% is probably closer to 2.6%, 2.7% and so that really becomes the area that we're looking to drive down.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Interestingly, it's not concentrated in the U.S. mortgage business, the U.S. mortgage business, they only constitutes about a third of the operating expenses that are in Citi Holdings. So, it really is our ability to drive down, get rid of the assets in LCL outside of the U.S. real estate loan. So there it's the businesses that we've got remaining in the international book and then some of the other businesses that are still in Holdings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Ed Najarian - ISI Group</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Well, I guess that's what I'm driving at though, as those assets come down, do you have a plan or vision of how those costs will come out in conjunction so that 2.3% number doesn't lies too much or conversely are you telling us that it will rise for a while?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">No, I am saying that we will bring down the -- we are bring down the expenses as we're bringing down the assets, what I was trying to give you is a flavor add of the mix. If you see, most of the assets coming down in SAP you're going to get less of an expense benefit than you would have, if we drive down the international assets in local consumer lending. So we are very focused and making sure that as we bring down the assets, we are taking down the operating expenses associated with those assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Ed Najarian - ISI Group</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay, okay, thanks. And then to follow up, I think the market is very pleased with clearly the increasing your B III Tier I common equity ratio and overall increasing your capital ratios in general. And with the start trading still at a fairly large discounted tangible book, it seems like investors would really love to see more return of capital next year, both the dividend increase and stock buyback. So going into the (inaudible) with much higher capital ratios this year, would love to hear from Vikram as well any sense of how you guys are thinking about the (inaudible) and thinking about capital return for 2013?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Vikram Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I think the sense we still so have similarly we haven't seen the scenario, yet and we're not going to see it for year or so I mean not \u2013 sorry, so. And as we look at that and then we'll decide what we request from the regulators on capital and obviously this is not a question of our ability to generate capital, as you know we've shown you that, it's now a matter of looking at the full picture, which we won't know for a little bit of while.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Ed Najarian - ISI Group</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Right, we haven't seen the stress scenario yet but if I guess if we can right now just go on a base line assumption that it's not going to change dramatically from last year's stress scenario how would you think about that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Vikram Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Well I will not presuppose what the stress scenario is going to be, one, we wait on that and if you don't mind, it's not that far away we'll get the real scenario and we'll go through it then.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Ed Najarian - ISI Group</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay all right. Thanks a lot.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Vikram Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Sure.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Your next question will come from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yes, hi, a couple of follow ups just to what Ed was just asking, John you kind of crashed through your Basel III 8% target. Do you have a revised outlook for where your Basel III capital Tier 1 might get to by the end of this year or end of next year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I don't think we're going to be publishing any guidance near term I still feel pretty confident that will above 8% by year end but John if you just take the current consensus estimates for our earnings over the next five quarters if you just take that level of income that in and of itself would add about -- roughly 135 basis points to our existing 8.6%. So you could argue that we could be approaching 10% of those estimates came through.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">You know now obviously there is a lot of other factors that can come into play but subject to all the usual caveats we should be able to achieve a 9% Basel III Tier 1 common ratio, sometime next year, maybe 9.5%. What would you say?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">You said 9%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Vikram Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I said 9% or 9.5% sorry.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And that\u2019s just you\u2019re using a consensus net income that\u2019s not including any other additional third party sales or anything like that right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Vikram Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">No nothing; nothing as far as Smith Barney sales or you know, any other impacts that the additional capital could have on reducing some of the threshold deductions that were subject to etcetera, etcetera.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay. And then on the expense drag of Holdings as you were just discussing with Ed, the perception that we\u2019ve had is that default servicing expenses around U.S. mortgages has been the majority. So it sounds like, do you see that that two-thirds of the kind of expense drag is not in U.S. mortgages that are in Holdings?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Vikram Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">If you look at the $1 billion of expenses, the operating expenses that we have in Holdings, it's roughly a third of that would be the U.S. residential mortgages.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay. Just to put a little more tangible sense, what are these other kinds of expenses are we talking about, the other two thirds, is it branches or servicing, personal, what goes away when the other assets go away?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Vikram Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Well, the other assets, let\u2019s say, we\u2019ve got two consumer operating businesses over in EMEA. We\u2019ve got a consumer business in Spain. We\u2019ve got a consumer business in Greece. We\u2019ve got the continued operations of OneMain Financial, that's an operating business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Lots of branches there, yeah.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Vikram Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yeah.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay, that\u2019s helpful, thanks. And then on the reserve release question in Holdings, John, what specific metrics are you watching when you debate internally about a more general release of reserves? Is it more your delinquencies what you are seeing sometimes when you speak about it, it sounds like you are talking about more macro. Is it a combo of your own delinquencies in the macro, can you give us anything there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Yeah, you know it\u2019s very much a combination of both our delinquencies and the macro environment; I mean you, and so, it\u2019s both.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay. And then, but nothing specific you could give us in terms of metrics you\u2019re watching?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">You know, we watch everything from unemployment to the HPI, again our delinquency statistics, almost anything that you could dream up, we watch.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay. And the idea, it sounds like you\u2019re getting closer to the idea where the models would make your release reserves, but you\u2019re not quite there yet, you want to see a little more out of the macro before you start doing that, is that fair?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I think it\u2019s fair that we want to see, as either both Vikram and I have said, I think the most important thing right now is to get through the fiscal cliff and then the secondary factor would be that you\u2019d like to see an economy that has got some real legs to it, one that\u2019s capable of creating jobs and actually driving down the real unemployment rate. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re in an economy where you\u2019re going to have housing lead the economy, I think you need the economy right now to lead the housing market and I\u2019m not quite sure as to exactly how much of a robust nature we\u2019ve got at the underlying economy at this point in time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay, that just sounds a little more macro than a couple of more quarters of your own delinquencies improving or that kind of thing, but okay, I think I got it. Just one last thing, on international consumer credit, you mentioned the regulatory changes have impacted you in Korea, are there any signs of increased regulatory scrutiny or changes around consumer lending in Latin America, either in Brazil or Mexico where you have pretty high yields and everyone has high yields, is there any concern about changes there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">We constantly watch the developments in those markets, especially in Brazil; Brazil, it has got an active program now with the government encouraging institutions to lower the lending rate, so that\u2019s something that we are clearly watching at this point in time. And again, we have repositioned our Brazil franchise so that we think we appropriately positioned, but it\u2019s something that we watch all the time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Your next question will come from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Hey, John a question for you, a couple of questions. Firstly VAR, so can you tell us what your VAR was for the quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I don't have that with me, Vivek I am sorry.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Do you any sense of up, down anything?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Sorry.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay. Second question 90 plus a fair amount, did I hear you right, you sold $750 million of delinquent loans from LCL?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I believe they were primarily delinquent; there may have been a few non-delinquents in there, but yes primarily delinquent.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay. So that would imply that then if I adjust for that your past dues were actually up linked quarter by $300 million or so assuming whatever the precise number is and that\u2019s both 90 plus were up and early delinquencies were also up?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">The answer is you are right, they would have been up, don\u2019t forget you have got a continuing ageing book, a lot of those delinquent loans actually came out of the 180 day bucket, I don't have the break down in front of me Vivek, but lot of the portfolio actually came from loans where we would already taken the initial writedown. And so I\u2019ll see what we can do by getting you some more detailed information, but, I just don't have the bucket-by-bucket breakdown of the delinquent loans, but a lot it as I said came out of the 180 day plus bucket.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">And so your point is that the reason the early delinquencies are still going up is just ageing of \u2013these are all borrowers are now falling apart from falling behind or is there\u2026?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Actually, the blip that you see in the 30 to 89 bucket, it\u2019s actually, that\u2019s an internal impact; we\u2019ve changed some payment schedules and so we got a blip in our early bucket right now. I expect that to dissipate by the time when you see the fourth quarter results. So I wouldn\u2019t read too much into that early that increase in the early bucket delinquencies.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Your next question comes from the line of Erica Penala with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Erica Penala - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Hi good afternoon I just had a few quick follow up questions. And the first is on capital return, do you get a sense of percent has gotten, a better sense in the actual risk profile of your international credit portfolio coming into this year\u2019s SICAR; is it feels like is that sort of where the differences with regards to what\u2019s actually happening at Citi versus what they were assuming what happened in a stress scenario?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Vikram Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">I don\u2019t want to say whether or not they have got a better feel for to better understanding; but what I will say is that, since the time of the last SICAR submission we\u2019ve spend a lot of time with representatives from the Fed and importantly the Fed has been very gracious with their time allowing us to get some access to the people who actually run the models, so that I think each side has got a better understanding now of what is driving things and what data is needed. So I'd say it's been a very constructive process that has continued over the course of the last six months or so.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Erica Penala - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Got it and my one -- last follow up question. I apologize for another Holdings related question, but in terms of your reserving model, on a go forward basis, if you think about new frequency and incremental severity, are your assumptions on a go-forward basis for flat unemployment trends and continued declining home prices?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">I'm not going to comment on individual variables in our assumptions in our various loan loss models but obviously both of those are factors that had come in to play but I am not going to comment on exactly how we maybe modeling that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Erica Penala - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Okay, thanks for taking my question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Not a problem.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Hi, how much of the $53 billion DTA is for the U.S. only?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">You know, Mike, I don't have that number in front of me. The last number that I have and we can follow up with you to get you some more specifics would be that about roughly $5 billion or so would have been international and then the balance would be both U.S. Federal and State and there's obviously some state and local that comes in to play as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Alright or maybe you can just help me with what I'm trying to get to. If the corporate tax rate is reduced, let's it was reduced by one fifth what sort of write down would you have on your DTA?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">You know Mike, as we've discussed in other calls, you've got to break. Let's us assume for argument's purposes now that of the $53 billion roughly $45 billion is U.S. Federal, okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Then in that U.S. Federal $45 billion there's a component there, that would be a tax credit, so foreign tax credits. Most people when they're looking at the prospects for tax reform are the working assumption anyway is that those tax credits would stay in place, you're entitled in those tax credits, that would remove the tax credits from the equation as far as the impact on of the rate reduction.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">So there you'd be left with say $20 billion to $25 billion of Federal related DTA that could be subject to tax reform, you then have to think about what year would we have Federal tax reform, but if it was at the current point in time and you actually had a 20% reduction then you would be looking at the FTA would be -- the DTA would need to have a evaluation or write-off actually of somewhere around $4 billion to $5 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">All right, that was clear. And moving onto the $95 billion of mortgages in Holdings, you said do not expect a rapid reduction in those mortgages, but why not? You said that you feel better about the housing market; you're not willing to call the turn that you feel so much better why not more aggressive sales?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">The ability to sell requires willing buyers and the buyer -- the biggest stumbling block, I think that we've got right now from a buyer's point of view would be liquidity. Most of the sales that where people want to buy mortgages are very specific MSAs where you get specialty servicers that are looking to take on some of the delinquent mortgages because they've got a real in depth understanding of the local market.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">And so you're looking at sales packages of $200 million-$300 million. It's hard to build that up to some substantial volume where you would see a rapid reduction in the overall mortgage book, they just aren't a great deal of big national buyers in the market right now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Maybe you can help me connect the theory to the reality, I mean theory would say simply lower the prices and at a certain price there's always buyers. So what's wrong with that theory?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Vikram Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">What's wrong Mike, is very simply we also have to look at our net present value decision. One of the reasons why you don't have buyers out there is there is still not funding available, you haven't seen a residential securitization market yet? Have you? Not quite.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">So the point on this is a very straight forward one which is it's the funding that's causing the issue not necessarily the valuation levels only on the mortgages. And we have to do what's right for our shareholders. We have the funding base, we have a clear perspective on what these assets are worth and we're going to sell them at prices we think are in the interest of our shareholders.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Okay. And then switching gears again, back to the theory, the theory says slowing economies therefore more credit concerns and to the extent that Asia is slowing, would you have more concerns there and you saw little tick up in your Citicorp International Credit the [NCL] ratio went up from 1.8 to 1.9, not a big deal, the other metrics are fine. But as you look ahead, are you starting to take some extra precaution?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Vikram Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">I would tell you again the quality of our portfolio is very strong we are an urban lender we have a more affluent portfolio it's diversified and yes there are questions about what rate the growth is going to be at but the rates are still very significant out there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">So as we look at the situation in Asia the question to us is really is more about what's the rate of revenue growth not so much issues about the quality of the books that we have.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">And then last question as it relates to LIBOR investigation, last quarter you've seen pretty fine with the question when you think you'll hear about the LIBOR investigation and how do you feel today?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Vikram Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">As we say \u2013 I'm going to repeat what I said last time, which is that we're cooperating with the authorities that have asked for information and we'll work on their timeline.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">And do you have any sense of when you'll hear anything?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Vikram Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">We will wait to hear from them when they are ready.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">All right, good enough. Thank you </p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Financial.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Good afternoon. Just a couple of quick questions John you mentioned some of the trends in the securities businesses and in the third quarter and I realized it's very early in Q4. But I'm curious if you're seeing any reduction in activity levels from clients who might be a little more cautious heading into the election in the fiscal cliff?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">I don't think I'm going to give a comment on the early stages of the fourth quarter market.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Vikram Pandit</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Now but having said that, there's no question uncertainties are good for the economy. It's never good for the markets and at some point it's not about what happens to the cliff. It is leading up to cliff that can have an impact as well. All of those are uncertainties still ahead of us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">And then just a quick administrative question, John you targeted our estimated debt effective tax rate going forward last quarter moving forward would be about 22%, any change to that guidance?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Yeah, I would up it probably to 24% right now, you take a look at our tax rate this quarter, it's certainly very noisy given some of the things that have happened. If you strip out the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney loss and the $580 million tax reserve release. That gives you a rate that's more in line with what you would normally see. And you strip out those two and our rate becomes, something a shade under 24%, I think it's like 23.6%, 23.7%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">So that's just a shade over the guidance that I gave last quarter, about 22% and I would expect the fourth quarter to be more in line with that 23% to 24% range that you see in the third quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Okay, thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Not a problem.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">At this time, there are no further questions. </p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Susan Kendall</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Alright, thank you all for joining us today.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Thank you all very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference.

Afterwards, we\u2019ll be happy to take questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation may contain forward-looking statements which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results in capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2011 Form 10-K.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Susan, thank you and good morning everyone, and welcome. As you know, we reported earnings of $1.2 billion for the fourth quarter of 2012. Excluding DVA and our repositioning charge, net income was $2.2 billion, or $0.69 per share. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">These earnings were below expectations, reflecting the high level of legacy costs, most notably in legal and related expenses. We also had a reserve release which was significantly smaller than in previous quarters as our credit trends are normalizing and we\u2019ve not yet begun to release mortgage reserves.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">To be clear, we\u2019re not satisfied with these bottom line earnings, and our focus is not only on putting the drag of legacy issues behind us, but also on optimizing the efficiency and returns of our business as a whole.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Despite the disappointing bottom line, our businesses generally performed well during the quarter. Investment banking increased its wallet share, loans grew in our core businesses, such as Latin American consumer, where we saw double digit growth. In addition, we decreased Citi Holdings assets by 9% during the quarter for a 31% reduction for the year. Our capital strength improved during the quarter, with the tier 1 common ratio increasing to an estimated 8.7% on a Basel III basis. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Although the environment has shown signs of improvement, we believe it\u2019s likely to remain challenging, with continued spread compression, the introduction and implementation of new or evolving regulation, as well as the costs associated with putting legacy issues behind us. This puts even greater importance on getting our operating efficiency to a level we\u2019re satisfied with, and on allocating our resources to opportunities with the greatest risk-adjusted return. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Regardless of the environment, Citi needs to be recognized globally as an indisputably strong and stable bank. We believe the proper essentials are the combination of a strong balance sheet, made up of high-quality assets, supported by the appropriate levels of capital and liquidity. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Along with our risk profile, our necessary levels of capital and liquidity are a function of the consistency of the quantity and quality of our earnings, and as a company, we need to deliver on our commitments. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">When I became CEO in October, I stated three main objectives to accomplish by early in the New Year. First, conduct business reviews and prepare the 2013 budget, which drove our repositioning charge in the fourth quarter. Second was to structure my management team, which was announced on January 7, and third was to finalize and submit our CCAR, which was submitted on the same day.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Throughout this period, I spent a good amount of time meeting with stakeholders, our clients, investors, regulators, and of course our people. Let me make a few points based on those conversations. First, our strategy is to focus on our core banking businesses by trying to provide best in class products and services to people and institutions leveraging our global footprint, which includes the world\u2019s growing fastest markets and cities. We believe our strategy is aligned with the dominant secular trends.<br><br>Second, we\u2019ll continue to seek ways to refine and optimize the execution of our strategy and focus on operating efficiency. As a company, we need to show expense discipline and we can be smart allocators of our resources, driving them where they can catalyze strong, risk-adjusted returns.<br><br>For example, the $900 million in expense reductions we expect to realize in 2013 from the repositioning actions we announced in December, was driven by a bottoms-up review of where and how we\u2019re going to allocate our expense dollars. That said, improving our operating efficiency needs to be BAU, not just an annual event.<br><br>Third, we\u2019re very focused on Citi Holdings, considering the disproportionate  drag at places on net income and returns. In 2002, we reduced the size of Citi Holdings by 31% and it now makes up 8% of our balance sheet. That being said, there is no silver bullet which will immediately resolve Holdings.<br><br>We\u2019ll continue to manage these assets and our associated expenses in an economically rational way while taking advantage of any reasonable opportunities to reduce them more expeditiously.<br><br>And as you know, our North American mortgage portfolio makes up the majority of Holdings\u2019 assets. Trends in that portfolio were favorable in the recent quarter and we continue to watch the US economy and housing market very closely.<br><br>But before I turn it over to John, I\u2019d like to emphasize that we recognize our net income today doesn\u2019t yet reflect either the amount or caliber of earnings our shareholders expect and that our franchise is capable of. It\u2019ll take some time to work through the challenges of the current environment to realize the potential.<br><br>Improving our operating efficiency, returns on assets and tangible equity in a risk-balanced manner and returning capital to our shareholders are critical goals going forward.<br><br>I\u2019m a believer in you are what you measure and I intend to set clear goals and hold my management team accountable for them. Similarly, we\u2019ll share key metrics with you in the coming months so you can hold me accountable as well.<br><br>Now, John will go over the slides and then we\u2019d be happy to answer any of your questions. Thank you.<br><br><strong>John Gerspach</strong><br><br>Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. To start, I\u2019d like to highlight some significant items affecting our results this quarter. First CVA and DVA were negative $485 million pre-tax and $301 million after tax in the fourth quarter for a negative impact on EPS of $0.10.<br><br>In addition, as previously announced, we recorded a $1 billion pre-tax repositioning charge in the fourth quarter, or $653 million after tax, for a negative impact on EPS of $0.21.<br><br>For comparison purposes, in the fourth quarter of 2011, CVA and DVA had a minimal impact at negative $40 million pre-tax and repositioning costs were $428 million pre-tax or $275 million after tax for a total negative impact of $0.10 per share.<br><br>Adjusting for these items we earned $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2012 or $0.69 per share as compared to $0.41 per share in the fourth quarter of 2011. Throughout today\u2019s earnings presentation, I will be discussing our result excluding both CVA and DVA as well as the higher than normal repositioning costs in the fourth quarters of 2011 and 2012 to provide comparability to prior periods.<br><br>I will also discuss prior quarters excluding the impact of gains and losses on minority investments as well as the tax benefit in the third quarter of 2012. A full schedule of repositioning charges by business is included in the appendix.<br><br>In addition, as shown on Slide 4, there are a few other significant items which are included in our results.<br><br>First, operating expenses in the fourth quarter included legal and related costs of nearly $1.3 billion compared to $529 million last quarter and $832 million in the prior year. Legal and related costs in Citicorp including Corp other, increased significantly from prior periods to $735 million driven primarily by U.S. consumer-related matters. And, Citi Holdings legal expenses were roughly $550 million, including the previously announced $305 million charge related to the foreclosure review settlement. Second, the net loan loss reserve release of $86 million this quarter, was significantly lower than prior periods. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Year over year, about half of the decline in the reserve release was driven by Citicorp, mostly in North America cards, and about half was driven by Citi Holdings, reflecting declining loan and reserve balances versus last year. In Citi Holdings, we recorded a net reserve build in the fourth quarter as a significantly lower net reserve release was more than offset by the impact of losses on loan sales. This compared to a reserve release of $663 million last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On slide five, we show total Citigroup results for the quarter. Revenues of $18.7 billion were up 8% from last year, while operating expenses of $12.8 billion were roughly flat as higher legal and related costs were offset by a 3% decline in core operating expenses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Credit costs of $3.2 billion increased 11% versus last year. Net credit losses of $3.1 billion declined by 25%. However, as I just discussed, the net reserve release of $86 million was down significantly from $1.5 billion last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We earned $2.2 billion of net income in the fourth quarter, or $0.69 per share, up from $0.41 per share last year on a comparable basis. This was driven by loan growth, lower core operating expenses, and lower net credit losses, partially offset by the increase in legal and related expenses and a lower net loan loss reserve release.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Citigroup end of period loans grew 1% year over year to $655 billion, as loan growth in Citicorp continued to outpace the wind-down of Citi Holdings and deposits grew 7% to $931 billion. We saw an expected decline in deposits during the fourth quarter, reflecting the runoff of episodic deposits which came in at the end of the third quarter, as well as the expiration of the transaction account guarantee, or TAG program. This decline was partially offset by continued growth in core operating account balances.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On slide six, we show full year results, including the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Throughout today\u2019s earnings presentation, I will be discussing Citicorp results including our operating businesses: Global Consumer Banking, Securities and Banking, and Transaction Services, as well as the Corporate Other segment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Full year 2012 revenues for Citigroup were $77 billion, up slightly from 2011, with less than 5% of revenues coming from Citi Holdings. Operating expenses were down 2% and credit costs also declined as a significant reduction in net credit losses was offset by a smaller loan loss reserve release in 2012 versus the prior year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">For the full year, Citigroup earned nearly $12 billion in net income, up 18% from last year. On slide 7, we show quarterly results for Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Citicorp generated fourth quarter revenues of $17.6 billion and net income of $3.2 billion. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Year over year, revenues grew 9% and expenses were up 3% as higher legal and related costs were partially offset by a 2% decline in core operating expenses. And, for the eighth consecutive quarter, we grew loans year over year in every business in Citicorp. Total Citicorp loans grew 7%, with consumer loans up 3% and corporate loans up 11%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Citi Holdings had revenues of $1 billion, and a net loss of $1 billion. Citi Holdings ended the quarter with $156 billion of assets, down 15% during the quarter and $69 billion, or 31%, year over year. At quarter end, Citi Holdings accounted for 8% of total Citigroup assets. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On slide eight, we show a nine-quarter trend for Citicorp\u2019s results. As I noted, Citicorp\u2019s revenues of $17.6 billion were 9% higher year over year, and down 4% sequentially, mostly reflecting seasonally lower capital markets revenues.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Expenses of $11.3 billion were up 3% from last year and 2% sequentially due to the higher legal and related costs.<br><br>Citicorp\u2019s net credit losses of $2.1 billion continued to decline in the fourth quarter, down 19% from last year, driven by improvement in North America cards and the net loan loss reserve release in Citicorp was $137 million, down significantly from the prior quarter and prior year, mostly reflecting a decline in the net reserve release in North America cards. Year-over-year, we grew Citicorp\u2019s earnings in every quarter of 2012.<br><br>On Slide 9, we show Citicorp\u2019s pre-tax earnings by business excluding the impact of loan loss reserves. For the full year 2012, earnings grew to just over $20 billion, up 40% from 2011, driven by consumer banking and securities and banking.<br><br>Slide 10 shows the results for North America consumer banking. Total revenues of $5.3 billion in the fourth quarter were up 3% year-over-year, largely driven by higher gains on sales of mortgage loans, partially offset by a decline in cards revenues. Total card revenues were down 3% from last year as lower average loans were partially offset by an improvement in spreads.<br><br>Lower retail services revenues also reflected improving credit and its impact on contractual partner payments. Total operating expenses of $2.6 billion were down 3% year-over-year primarily due to efficiency savings.<br><br>On a sequential basis, the increase in expenses was primarily driven by higher legal and related costs. Credit costs of $1.1 billion increased 10% year-over-year and were up 25% sequentially.<br><br>Net credit losses declined by 27% year-over-year to $1.3 billion driven by improvement in cars. However, the net loan loss reserve release was significantly lower than prior periods at $215 million this quarter compared to $784 million in the prior year and $518 million last quarter.<br><br>Looking ahead to 2013, assuming a continuation of the current economic environment here in the US, we expect the average quarterly net reserve releases in cards to roughly approximately the fourth quarter level.<br><br>Earnings before tax, excluding the impact of loan loss reserves, nearly doubled from last year to $1.5 billion. Overall, we continue to see progress in our North America consumer franchise. Average deposits grew for the seventh consecutive quarter, up 9% year-over-year, including double-digit growth in checking account balances.<br><br>In branded cards, accounts also grew for the seventh consecutive quarter, up 3% year-over-year and for both card portfolios, net credit margins continued to expand year-over-year.<br><br>On Slide 11, we show results for international consumer banking in constant dollars. On this basis, both revenues and expenses grew 4% year-over-year. In Latin America, both revenues and expenses grew 7% from last year and in AMEA, we generated positive operating leverage with revenue growth of 11% and expense growth of 5% year-over-year.<br><br>In Asia, revenues were down 2% from last year while expenses were up 1%. However, on a sequential basis, revenues were flat as we began to move past the headwinds in both Korea and Japan. I\u2019ll talk more about Asia in a minute.<br><br>Most drivers for international consumer banking continued to grow in the fourth quarter. Total average loans grew 5% from last year. Card purchase sales were up 10% and investment sales grew 36% year-over-year.<br><br>Credit costs of $869 million in the fourth quarter were up 12% from last year, driven by a 12% growth in net credit losses due mostly to loan growth as well as some specific commercial loan charge-offs in Latin American.<br><br>On Slide 12, we show our Asian consumer results in a bit more detail. Total revenues remained under pressure in the fourth quarter due to the continued low rate environment and the impact of regulatory headwinds in certain markets, most notably, Korea.<br><br>Our underlying business volumes, however, reflected continued franchise strength and importantly, credit performance remained very good, reflecting the high quality of our portfolio. We also maintained expense discipline across the region, while still investing in important markets such as China.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Looking first at the cards business, revenues grew 2% year over year with significant growth in card purchases. In total, purchase sales grew 8% from last year and, excluding Korea, purchase sales were up 9% versus prior periods. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Investment sales revenue showed strong performance, up 14% year over year and down moderately from a particularly good third quarter, as retail investor sentiment improved, and we continued to attract high-quality customers. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Revenue pressure was most evident in our retail lending and deposit businesses, down 10% year over year as spread compression offset volume growth. Volumes were muted in Korea in particular. Excluding this market, average retail loans grew 8% year over year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Our overall outlook for Asia remains positive, and we continue to believe we can grow 2013 revenues at an annual rate of 4-6% from current levels. We also believe that longer-term, as customers become less risk-averse and interest rates normalize, revenue growth in Asia will converge with the existing driver growth and that should feed through the earnings, given our efficiency, portfolio quality, and strong market position.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Slide 13 shows our international consumer credit trends. Credit quality in our international consumer portfolio remains strong in the fourth quarter. For total international consumer banking, the NCL rate increased 17 basis points from last quarter to 215 basis points, driven by Latin America, while 90-plus day delinquencies were fairly stable at just above 90 basis points.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In Latin America, the increase in the NCL rate reflected a $50 million sequential increase in retail net credit losses. Roughly a third of this increase was related to two specific commercial loan charge offs in Mexico and the remainder primarily reflected seasoning of the portfolio, mainly personal loans in Mexico, Colombia, and Brazil.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In Latin America, we expect retail banking NCL rates should normalize in the range of 2.5% by the second half of 2013. The card NCL rate in Latin America remains stable in the fourth quarter at 7.7%. However, we would expect this portfolio to normalize to a level of around 8.5% in 2013 as the portfolio seasons. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On a combined basis, therefore, we expect the NCL rate in Latin America to normalize in the range of 4.5% by the second half of 2013, based on what we see today. In Asia, both the NCL and delinquency rates remained fairly stable at 1% and 50 basis points, respectively. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Slide 14 shows our Securities and Banking business. Revenues of $4.8 billion grew 47% from last year, and were down 14% from the prior quarter, on seasonally lower capital markets revenues. Investment banking revenues of $996 million grew 56% from the prior year and 8% sequentially, with higher revenues in all major products.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Overall, our wallet share in investment banking improved this year in most products and regions. Equity market revenues of $455 million nearly doubled from last year, driven by improved derivatives performance as well as the absence of the prior period\u2019s proprietary trading losses. However, sequentially, equity market revenues were down 11% on lower derivatives revenues.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Fixed income market revenues of $2.7 billion grew 58% from last year, driven by significant improvement in credit and securitized products as well as higher revenues in rates and currencies. Sequentially, fixed income revenues declined 27% from a strong third quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Lending revenues, excluding the impact of gains and losses on hedges related to accrual loans, were $397 million in the fourth quarter, up 17% from last year, on higher loan balances and improved spreads, and down 11% sequentially on loan sale activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Total operating expenses of of $3.4 billion were down 2% from last year driven by efficiency savings.<br><br>Credit costs were $78 million in the fourth quarter and net income grew substantially year-over-year to $1.1 billion.<br><br>Moving now to transaction services on Slide 15, revenues of $2.6 billion were up 1% from last year. Treasury and trade solutions was up 1% year-over-year driven by continued growth in deposits and trade loans partially offset by ongoing spread compression and securities and fund services revenues were flat to last year as growth in fee revenues was also offset by continued spread compression.<br><br>The drivers for transaction services continued to show strong momentum. End of period trade loans were up 24% from the prior year. Average deposits were up 16% and assets under custody grew by 10%.<br><br>Expenses of $1.5 billion were up 2% from last year due mostly to higher legal and related costs as well as certain episodic items, which also drove part of the increase from the prior quarter.<br><br>We experienced negative operating leverage in transaction services in the fourth quarter, reflecting both spread compression in revenues and the increase in expenses. While we currently expect client volumes to continue to grow, revenue pressure from spread compression is likely to persist in the near term.<br><br>Quarterly expenses, however, should be somewhat lower than fourth quarter 2012 levels as we go forward. As such, we expect to return to positive operating leverage in transaction services on a full-year basis in 2013.<br><br>Slide 16 shows the results for corporate other. Revenues of negative $76 million were down from the prior year driven by the absence of last year\u2019s hedging gains and lower investment yields.<br><br>Expenses of $805 million were significantly higher versus last year, mainly due to higher legal and related expenses. Assets of $249 billion included approximately $46 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $144 billion of liquid available for sale securities.<br><br>Slide 17 shows Citi Holdings\u2019 assets. We ended the quarter with assets of $156 billion in Citi Holdings or roughly 8% of total Citigroup assets. The $15 billion reduction in the fourth quarter reflected $4 billion of asset sales, $10 billion of net paydowns and roughly $1 billion of cost of credit.<br><br>On Slide 18, we show Citi Holdings\u2019 financial results for the quarter. Total revenues of $1 billion were down 2% year-over-year, as declines in local consumer lending were largely offset by higher revenues in the special asset pool reflecting an improvement in asset marks.<br><br>Citi Holdings\u2019 expenses were down 15% year-over-year to $1.5 billion mostly due to the reduction in assets and on a sequential basis the increase mostly reflects the $305 million charge related to the foreclosure review settlement.<br><br>Credit costs increased 14% year-over-year to $1.2 billion. Total net credit losses of $972 million were down 36% year-over-year. However, we recorded a net loan loss reserve build in the fourth quarter as a significantly lower net reserve release was more than offset by the impact of losses on loans sets. This compared to a net reserve release of $663 million last year.<br><br>Looking at the past five quarters of Citi Holdings\u2019 results on Slide 19, rep and warranty reserve builds, legal and related costs and repositioning charges continued to weigh on Citi Holdings in the fourth quarter.<br><br>On an operating basis, however, excluding these items, we maintained a modest positive operating margin again in the fourth quarter and our goal is to continue to generate positive margins, although there may be quarter-to-quarter fluctuations arising from periodic gains or losses as we continue to wind down the assets.<br><br>Credit trends remain favorable this quarter with North America mortgages comprising 75% of total net credit losses. We ended the quarter with $8.4 billion of loan loss reserves allocated to North America mortgage loans in Citi Holdings, or 33 months of loss coverage. On slide 20, we show mortgage loan and adjusted net credit loss trends over the past two years. Since the fourth quarter of 2010, we have reduced the North America mortgage loans in Citi Holdings by 27%, driven by $19 billion of paydowns, $6 billion of asset sales, and $9 billion of net losses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">In the recent fourth quarter, we sold nearly $600 million of delinquent loans. We have also significantly reduced the quarterly net credit losses on the portfolio, down 40% since the fourth quarter of 2010 to $762 million, even while roughly $60 million of losses were accelerated into the recent quarter as a result of the continued actions we are taking to fulfill our commitments under the National Mortgage Settlement, or NMS. We currently expect NMS to continue to have an impact on net credit losses through the second quarter of 2013. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Delinquency trends improved as well through the fourth quarter, in both residential first mortgages and home equity loans. Assuming the continuation of the current economic environment here in the U.S., the net credit losses on these portfolios should generally decline over time, as the portfolio continues to shrink.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On slide 21, we show our net interest margin and revenue trends. Our net interest margin expanded in the fourth quarter by 7 basis points to 2.93%, with about half of the improvement driven by our trading book and the remainder reflecting lower funding costs, partially offset by lower loan yields. Net interest revenue also increased from last quarter, as growth in Citicorp net interest revenue offset the ongoing wind-down of Citi Holdings. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On a full year basis, our net interest margin remained relatively stable versus last year at 288 basis points. And, we currently believe we can maintain our net interest margin at roughly this level for 2013, with some quarterly fluctuations.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Turning to total Citigroup expenses, on slide 22, while reported operating expenses of $13.8 billion in the fourth quarter were 5% higher than last year, core operating expenses, excluding legal and related costs and repositioning charges, declined 3% in constant dollars to $11.5 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We currently believe $11.5 billion is an indicative base for quarterly operating expenses going into 2013. From this level, Citi Holdings expenses should decline over time with the ongoing reduction in assets. We will continue to pursue ongoing reengineering opportunities and we continue to expect to achieve $900 million of expense savings in 2013, related to our announced repositioning actions, with full year expense savings of $1.2 billion beginning in 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">These total expense savings will likely be offset in part by volume-related costs, particularly as we seek to grow client volumes in the low interest rate environment. Overall, however, we expect core operating expenses in 2013 to be lower than full year 2012. Of course, legal and related costs will likely continue to be elevated and somewhat volatile, although we would not expect our fourth quarter levels to be the new norm.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On slide 23, we show our key capital metrics through the fourth quarter. Under Basel III, our estimated tier 1 common ratio increased to 8.7% versus 8.6% in the third quarter. And, our Basel I tier 1 common ratio remained flat at 12.7%. Adjusting for the final market risk rules that became effective this month, our Basel I tier 1 common ratio would have been approximately 11.2%. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">In summary, our results in the fourth quarter reflected the challenging operating environment as we faced elevated legal and related costs and continued spread compression, particularly in the U.S. and Asia. In consumer banking, we continued to see strong loan growth in Latin America, and in Asia we began to move past some of the regulatory headwinds which slowed volumes in the second half of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Importantly, the credit trends in our global consumer portfolio remained favorable with net credit losses and delinquencies at historically low levels. In securities and banking, we demonstrated our ability to grow revenues while maintaining expense disciplines and our investment banking franchise showed good progress.<br><br>And finally, in transaction services, we faced a continued low interest rate environment in many local markets but we showed positive operating leverage for the year as higher volumes offset spread compression.<br><br>We continued to reduce Citi Holdings, which represented only 8% of total assets at year-end. We also ended the year with demonstrated strength in both capital and liquidity.<br><br>As we go into 2013, we are keenly aware of the challenging rate environment but remain positive in our ability to grow volumes to offset this headwind given our unique global footprint.<br><br>We are also highly focused on efficiency and optimizing our core businesses in order to drive improved returns. With that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions.<br><br id=\"question-answer-session\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong><br><br><strong>Operator</strong><br><br>[Operator instructions] \u00a0Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Nomura.<br><br><strong>Glenn Schorr \u2013 Nomura</strong><br><br>I guess, John, you gave some good detail on some of the improving credit trends in Holdings and the mortgage portfolio. I guess the blunt question \u2013 I know we\u2019ve asked it in the past \u2013 is what more do you need to see to start freeing up the reserves? \u00a0It\u2019s $8.4 billion, you have 33 months now. It\u2019s a big difference because it goes hand in hand with the question of how do we get that P&amp;L impact of Holdings lower. So just curious on your thoughts there.<br><br><strong>John Gerspach</strong><br><br>Glenn, your observations are absolutely right as far as \u2013 and we\u2019ve pointed this out before - as far as being able to begin charging those [NCLs] [ph] against the reserve is one way of driving Holdings towards breakeven.<br><br>But as we\u2019ve said last quarter, we want to make sure that those trends \u2013 and we do see some strong positive trends in the housing market. We want to make sure that they are sustainable.<br><br>And at the end of last quarter, we pointed out to we wanted to see the US get past the whole fiscal cliff issue. Well, unfortunately at the end of the year, the resolution of the fiscal cliff was basically kicking the can down the road. So I think that what we would like to see now is how the US deals with the ongoing debt ceiling debate and the upcoming sequester on expense reductions.<br><br>We get through that, and we see how the economy performs, we see whether or not the trends that we see now are sustainable and then we\u2019ve got decisions to make.<br><br><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura</strong><br><br>Crystal ball, that\u2019s a 2013 event though?<br><br><strong>John Gerspach</strong><br><br>You tell me how we\u2019re going to come through the debt ceiling\u2026<br><br><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura</strong><br><br>They\u2019re going to put another band aid on it.<br><br><strong>John Gerspach</strong><br><br>We\u2019ll take a look.<br><br><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura</strong><br><br>The $10 billion in paydowns this quarter that you mentioned, is that \u2013 are there specifics to the portfolio that would make fourth quarter more or less or is $10 billion a quarter fair enough to think about?<br><br><strong>John Gerspach</strong><br><br>Glenn, I just want to make sure that we\u2019re focused on the same items. When we were talking about that net pay downs, that\u2019s not the overall in the mortgage portfolio. I don\u2019t know if you\u2026<br><br><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura</strong><br><br>I\u2019m with you, correct, but it\u2019s inside Holdings\u2019 assets, correct?<br><br><strong>John Gerspach</strong><br><br>Yes, that\u2019s fine, that\u2019s fine. Look, we\u2019ve guided you for some time now that the pace of reduction in Holdings is going to slow and it won\u2019t necessarily be smooth quarter-after-quarter. So I wouldn\u2019t look at that $10 billion of net paydowns necessarily as being indicative. But we don\u2019t anticipate that it should drop off dramatically in the next quarter or two.<br><br><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura</strong><br><br>In the back end \u2013 in Slide 26 in the appendix, you gave us the Basel I to Basel III walkthrough and I guess there\u2019s a 24% increase when you go from one to the other. And that\u2019s been consistent.<br><br>What we\u2019ve seen at some of the competitors is as portfolios have reduced and as credit has continued to get better, some changes to the models and therefore Basel III assets go down, therefore your Basel III cap ratio goes up. Curious on what would be different on Citi\u2019s portfolio that we wouldn\u2019t see something similar.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Assuming that we continue to reduce the risk in the portfolio, and if there\u2019s an improving environment that is the way the model should work. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><br><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura</strong><br><br>So, bottom line, is at year end you didn\u2019t make big changes to the models for what you\u2019ve seen on credit, and so therefore no big reduction of Basel III. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">No, no. The reductions that you see in Basel III primarily reflect, again, movement in the actual books themselves.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><br><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura</strong><br><br>I appreciate that. One last quickie is you mentioned on the $1.3 billion of legal costs this quarter related to some consumer matters. I wouldn\u2019t mind just a little bit more color there. This way we can make our own decisions on whether or not we think that\u2019s the appropriate run rate or if fourth quarter was unusually high. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We don\u2019t go into detail on specific reserving actions unless it\u2019s in connection with a settlement that we\u2019re announcing. But look, many different aspects of U.S. consumer-related products and offerings are the focus of reviews across the industry, including by several of our regulators. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any secret that the CFPB has been reviewing various consumer products, and in fact they\u2019re currently reviewing us. But I\u2019m really not going to say anything more about individual regulator discussions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">And your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Hi, John, a couple of clarifying questions about your outlook comments. You indicated that you hope to keep the net interest margin stable. Would that imply that you expect to have some expansion of net interest income dollars given that the balance sheet is growing?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">The answer to that is it somewhat depends. I\u2019m going to have fudge this a little bit, only because of the impact of the trading book, and how that impacts net interest. So when you look at our core banking operation, we should have some improvement in net interest revenue. The difficult thing to project, always though, is the exact movements of net interest revenue, and therefore NIM, on the trading book. In this quarter, for instance, I mentioned roughly half, 4 basis points, of the 7 basis point improvement came about as a result of the trading portfolio. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay, that\u2019s fair enough. And then on the expense outlook, you said core operating expenses should be trending at the $11.5 billion per quarter? Right? </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">I said that that\u2019s a good base on which to start to think about it. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay. And for the year, you expect that core operating expense to be lower in 2013 versus \u201912. What\u2019s the amount in \u201912 you are looking at when you say it will be below that? </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Take a look at the full year reported operating expenses for Citigroup. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Do you have the number that you\u2019re looking at? </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">I think there\u2019s a slide in the appendix. How about 29? So it\u2019s 46.3. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So you expect the core operating expense to come in below that in \u201913. That\u2019s what you\u2019re shooting foreign. And that\u2019s before the $900 million in repositioning saves? </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">I rolled it all together. I\u2019m trying to stay away from giving you a specific number. But think in terms of the 11.5, as I said, as being an indicative base for moving forward. Off that 11.5 base, we\u2019re going to deliver the $900 million of expense saves coming off of the repositioning. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We\u2019re going to drive down expenses in Citi Holdings. We\u2019re going to have to spend some amount of money off of those two reductions in order to fuel volume growth that we\u2019ll see in the business, but we\u2019re also anticipating continuing our reengineering program and therefore driving up more expenses on top of the $900 million. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And then finally, we heard you say legal and related costs a lot today as you went through your remarks. And just a little bit of color on what\u2019s included in that type of category, because there was a lot of expense increase in this quarter attributed to legal and related. And what are your thoughts as we go through? It\u2019s obviously tough to predict this stuff, but do you expect to make some improvement on that front in \u201913?<br><br><strong>Mike Corbat</strong><br><br>Well, as I said, we don\u2019t \u2013 legal and related \u2013 let\u2019s see, what does this include? \u00a0Let me get to one of your specific questions.<br><br>It certainly includes the results of announced settlements. We can call that out for you just as we did with the $305 million settlement that we reached in connection with the foreclosure review, so, right. It would include other reserves that we take in relation to ongoing legal and regulatory matters for which we don\u2019t comment because there just \u2013 we\u2019re not going to comment on publicly until they become a fact.<br><br>So given that, those are the types of items that you look at and given the environment that we\u2019re in, that\u2019s why we would expect legal and related expenses to remain somewhat elevated as we move forward.<br><br>Legal and related for this year ran about $2 billion plus and closer to $3 billion, $2.9 billion. It\u2019s a $600 million or $700 million increase off of where we were last year. I think you\u2019re going to be looking at those types of levels going \u2013 at least in the near term.<br><br><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong><br><br>And one final specific question, can you tell us how much you had in expenses related to mortgage look backs and that might be ending with the independent foreclosure review settlement?<br><br><strong>Mike Corbat</strong><br><br>Yes, one of the good things coming out of that settlement is that we can stop incurring those expenses. Those expenses were running us just south of $200 million a year.<br><br><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong><br><br>And were they disproportionately in Holdings?<br><br><strong>Mike Corbat</strong><br><br>They were all in Holdings.<br><br><strong>Operator</strong><br><br>Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell \u2013 Buckingham Research.<br><br><strong>Jim Mitchell \u2013 Buckingham Research</strong><br><br>Can I ask about the LCR? \u00a0You guys have disclosed in the past that you, even under the more stringent criteria, you had I think in the third quarter, 116% LCR. With the new changes, have you had a chance to look at that and the way you might be in it? \u00a0Does that give you an opportunity to free up some cash?<br><br><strong>John Gerspach</strong><br><br>That\u2019s a very timely question. Actually, during the quarter, we actually did reduce the amount of excess cash that we were carrying towards the end of the quarter.<br><br><strong>Jim Mitchell \u2013 Buckingham Research</strong><br><br>Yes, that was my next question, thanks.<br><br><strong>John Gerspach</strong><br><br>So whereas we were running levels of a little bit north of $400 million, we\u2019re currently at about a $350 billion level on the excess cash. But even at that reduced level, under the new rules, we\u2019re running an LCR ratio of something to the tune of \u2013 it\u2019s either 116% or 118%. So we still think that we are certainly in compliance with the new rules as fully rolled out as we understand them.<br><br><strong>Jim Mitchell \u2013 Buckingham Research</strong><br><br>And so when we look at your balance sheet down \u2013 on a period-end basis, down $70 billion, is that a function of the fact that you used a lot of that cash to pay down debt? \u00a0Obviously you did have some decline in City Holdings as well but was a good chunk of that used to pay down debt?<br><br><strong>John Gerspach</strong><br><br>Yes, a fair chunk of that went to pay down debt. We also had, as we said, some deposit runoff, largely the runoff of those episodic deposits that we talked about coming in to us at the end of the third quarter.<br><br>And then we also made some additional investments available for sales securities. So I\u2019d say roughly on the $60 billion it\u2019s probably 50% going towards long-term debt, 25% is the deposit rundown and 25% or thereabouts on the growth in AFS securities.<br><br><strong>Jim Mitchell \u2013 Buckingham Research</strong><br><br>Then maybe the last one I guess I\u2019ll take a shot at capital return. Obviously there\u2019s been a lot of chatter. You can\u2019t really say exactly but can you maybe discuss maybe a just broader view of how you think about the (C-card)?<br><br><strong>Mike Corbat</strong><br><br>The way we approached (C-card) was probably not surprising to most. It\u2019s really job one or mission one really to put a submission in there where we could get approval. And so we\u2019re obviously focused on doing that. I think second thing we were focused on is in 2013 giving ourselves the goals of getting to and breaking a 9.5% Basel III tier common ratio.<br><br>And so I think those two things were the guiding principles of our submission and I\u2019ll leave it at that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">It sounds like you\u2019re not ready to comment on future cost saves, although there was a comment earlier that some additional efficiencies should be coming. So I do want to just prod a little bit there. As we think about the $1 billion or so of savings that you disclosed last month, is that kind of a downpayment on something that\u2019s going to be pretty big? Or is this a pretty big chunk of what the overall pie might be? </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Matt, I think that what you described as the downpayment was as I described the results of our budget process, and I think as we went through the budget, we came to some conclusions that we had expenses, people, businesses in places that we didn\u2019t think we were going to be able to earn the requisite returns on those businesses over the intermediate period, and chose and made decisions to exit, downsize, rescale those activities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I think as an institution, and you heard me mention it, that from an operating efficiency perspective our businesses and geographies need to be focused, really BAU, on the way they think about and run their businesses. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And so we\u2019re trying to drive, as we come out of this budget process, a mentality that rather than having one-off events or annual events around repositioning charges, people need to have specific metrics by which they\u2019re going to be held accountable for delivering against their businesses and that they need to make real-time decisions in terms of how they choose to make that happen. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And in terms of the timing of some of the metrics that you\u2019ll provide us and I guess just kind of the overall strategy review -- I can appreciate you\u2019re a couple of, or a few, months into this -- what\u2019s the timing of that in terms of when you\u2019ll communicate to investors and the Street? </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">You know, we\u2019re working through it, and I think over the next coming months we\u2019re going to come out with that. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And I realize it\u2019s still being formed, but as we think about which metrics are important to you, I\u2019m not going to pin you to the level, but in terms of whether it\u2019s the ROA, the ROE, the efficiency, or all of them, are there a couple of key ratios that you think about?  </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yeah, in my opening remarks I mentioned a few that I think are critical and my guess is as we refine this we\u2019ll speak to\u2026 In no particular order, I\u2019ve mentioned operating efficiency. I think ROA is one of those things I think that return on tangible common equity is a ratio that we should probably be out speaking and measuring ourselves to. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And then just lastly, maybe a question for John. If we look at some of the capital markets revenues and I guess specifically [thick], I think last quarter you had a very good quarter and maybe the first three quarters you gained a lot of share. And it seems like at least so far, as we have seen report this quarter, you might have given back a little bit this quarter. Is there something different in your mix, because it\u2019s more global, or just a product set, that maybe explains some of the relative weakness in 4Q?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I wouldn\u2019t call it a weakness in the fourth quarter at all. I actually think we had a very good fourth quarter in our [thick] business. And I think that for the full year, you\u2019ve got [thick] revenues up 28%. That\u2019s good performance. And I think that that ongoing performance, you know, reflects a lot of the repositioning that we did in the business in 2011. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So, relatively speaking, we probably had more of an outperformer in the third quarter and therefore it makes the fourth quarter -- you know, when you\u2019re doing quarterly sequential comparisons -- look a little small therefore. But I think that if you judge the year in its entirety, that\u2019s really the way to look at the business. And I think the business had an excellent 2012.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Just wanted to follow up first on something Glenn hit on, the reserves and holdings. And I just want to make really clear, there\u2019s nothing that you\u2019re seeing there in the data -- given your comments, John, I wouldn\u2019t assume so, but just want to make sure here -- that would be preventing you from releasing any reserves there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I think we\u2019ve been pretty clear that we feel pretty good about the underlying credit data in that mortgage book. Delinquencies continue to improve, the NCLs, as you can see, continue to go down. We put up some data for you at the financial services conference I spoke about in December, that point to some of the improvements that we see in the portfolio related to the dollars and the percentage of the portfolio, FICO scores over 660 and the amount of loans that had either FICO scores less than 580 or an LTV over 100%. And all of those trends are showing favorable movement. So the book looks pretty good.<br><br><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong><br><br>Yes, agreed. It just seems \u2013 and then you combine that with the home price improvements that we\u2019ve seen now over the last three quarters. It just seems really odd that we would get some reserve release.<br><br>Dysfunction in Washington is something that we\u2019re probably going to be able to count on until we normally would have been able to like Social Security. God knows whether that will happen.<br><br>So it\u2019s just \u2013 I guess I\u2019m just trying to figure out what\u2019s really preventing the releases there, especially giving the ETA.<br><br><strong>Mike Corbat</strong><br><br>If we end up with a sustainable stalemate that then produces a sustainable trend, maybe that\u2019ll give us the basis then to make some other decisions.<br><br><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong><br><br>And then could you quantify the impact that the loan sale had on the Holding reserve bill this quarter? \u00a0It sounds like there was a little bit of noise there.<br><br><strong>Mike Corbat</strong><br><br>Yes, it was a little over $100 million worth of losses that we took, net losses that we took on loan sales in the quarter and that flows into that LLR line.<br><br><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong><br><br>Then also on reserve, in Asia, we switched to a build there. Are we seeing a cyclical \u2013 any reason to believe that that\u2019s now a cyclical shift where there will be some build for a while or is that more one-time in nature.<br><br><strong>Mike Corbat</strong><br><br>I don\u2019t think it\u2019s one-time but I think if you look at Asia over the last three or four quarters, we\u2019re bouncing around a level of reserves. I think we had a reserve build in Asia. I can\u2019t remember if it was the first quarter or the second quarter.<br><br>Then we had some small releases. Now we\u2019ve got a small build. So I would just look at it as fine tuning the reserve levels.<br><br><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong><br><br>Then just a couple quick ones on cap markets. You guys don\u2019t provide comp ratios in securities and banking but when you look at the expense ratio delta, it didn\u2019t show the improvement there that some of the peers, particularly those reporting yesterday, showed.<br><br>Could you give some color on what\u2019s going on? \u00a0Is there any reason why those would diverge or is there any noise that might imply the actual trends didn\u2019t diverge as much as the reported numbers would imply?<br><br><strong>John Gerspach</strong><br><br>I think what you have \u2013 when you take a look at the business, you have to take a look at the full-year results in order to really get a true measure of performance and I\u2019m not \u2013 I don\u2019t have the full-year securities and banking numbers in front of me, ex-CVA and everything else.<br><br>But I believe that we did show improvement in the efficiency ratio in securities and banking during the course of the year and I think even now, if you just take a look at securities and banking, our efficiency ratio compares pretty well with the efficiency ratios of some of our peers.<br><br>Having said that, and as Mike indicated in his opening remarks, we\u2019re still not satisfied with where we are and we intend to drive for improvements in efficiency ratios in all of our businesses.<br><br><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong><br><br>Then last one, the DCM pipeline, can you maybe give some color on where that stands for you guys? \u00a0We had a pretty terrific end of the year. Are we going to be looking at a typical sequential uptick here as we head into the typically seasonally strong 1Q?<br><br><strong>John Gerspach</strong><br><br>I really can\u2019t comment on the pipeline at this point in time. I\u2019m sorry.<br><br><strong>Operator</strong><br><br>Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.<br><br><strong>Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley</strong><br><br>A couple of questions \u2013 one, at a recent conference I think you mentioned a mid-term goal on ROTCE of about 10% and I was wondering if you could give us some color, clarity behind timing on that and how much the announced changes that you\u2019ve made get you to that goal?<br><br><strong>John Gerspach</strong><br><br>I think that we would wrap up the timing on \u2013 more specific timing on that - in Mike\u2019s opening comments were, over the next coming months, we\u2019ll get you more specifics on that goal as well as improvements in ROA and operating efficiencies.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay, and then on the comments around investing to get the revenue share that you\u2019re looking for, how do you think through the timing? Just as you go throughout the year in 2013, you generate the expense saves and the $900 million that you discussed, and then you\u2019re investing that along the way or are you needing to see some revenue improvement first to have business units self-invest?  </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I think when we talk about operating efficiency, Betsy, it\u2019s the want to have the balance between a strong focus on expenses but understanding that you can\u2019t cut yourself to where you need to be, and that we have businesses we need to make investments in, but understanding that expenses are the things that you can control. So we\u2019re going to be looking across the company in terms of where and how we make those investments, and we\u2019re going to have a set of parameters and an understanding around those investments as they come for people to make them. But we need to be in a position to be able to make those on a regular basis and drive that in a BAU way.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question comes from the line of Erika Penala with Bank of America. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Erika Penala - Bank of America </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">My first question is actually a follow up to Matt and Betsy\u2019s questions. Mike, specifically regarding GCB in Asia and Lat-Am, we appreciated John\u2019s comments with regards to revenue growth potentially starting to converge into earnings growth in Asia. And now we have a public comparable in terms of looking at credit growth trends in Mexico now that Santander is public. I guess I\u2019m wondering, have you gotten a chance to evaluate whether or not the infrastructure in those two regions are right-sized to potentially reap the revenue acceleration? Or is it still sort of unwieldy relative to the secular changes of retail banking generally? And tell me if you need clarity on the last part of the question. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I think if I understand your question right, I think Erika it\u2019s important to understand the way we think about, and the way we\u2019ve asked Manuel to drive our consumer business, and that is that we operate a consumer business in roughly 40 countries around the world, and that we recognize that aside from a few individual countries, our scale is not going to come from any one particular country, that our scale has got to be driven on a global basis. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So as we think about our lending platforms, our card platforms, the mundane things of account openings, we\u2019ve got to make sure that the systems and the way we approach things allows us to recognize that scale on a global basis. So I don\u2019t think of our consumer business as being constrained in the intermediate term in terms of any individual geographies but it\u2019s making sure that we have this drive to come in on our platform so that that can occur. I\u2019m not sure if that answers your question. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Erika Penala - Bank of America </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I guess, just to be clear, there are not any additional investments that you would have to make in specific countries in those regions. I know you\u2019re focusing on China, but in Mexico, for example, to reap sort of the credit growth and the revenue growth, if the Mexican economy is picking up as much as folks down there are saying. There\u2019s no additional reinvestment coming? </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We\u2019ve been making investments. You know, we started making reasonable investments into Asia last year, and around the world -- Asia, Mexico, and other places. We\u2019ve continued to invest and I expect we\u2019ll continue to invest in some of those higher-growth areas into the future. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Erika Penala - Bank of America </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. And just a quick one that\u2019s not on Holdings reserves. If I look at the provision levels in GCB North America, it was up quarter over quarter, but flattish year over year. Is the bump up just simply seasonal as the volume spend is higher in the fourth quarter, and could potentially come down on a dollar level in the first quarter?  </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">You\u2019re talking about the overall provision, or just the NCL rate, I just want to make sure\u2026? </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Erika Penala - Bank of America </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">The overall provision in GCB North America. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yeah, see when you get into the overall provision, then you get a little bit into loan loss reserve releases. So let\u2019s talk a little bit about the credit losses, separate from loan loss reserve releases. Because I think we\u2019ve given you the guidance on the loan loss reserve releases that specifically in cards going forward, we would expect the loan loss reserve releases to be roughly at the level where we are in the fourth quarter, at least into 2013.<br><br>When you take a look at the NCL rates, though, the net credit losses have been improving, the net credit loss rate has been improving in both our branded and our retail services portfolios throughout the year.<br><br>We\u2019ve now got \u2013 I don\u2019t have the numbers right in front of me \u2013 but we\u2019ve got a 3.92, or something like that, NCL rate in branded cards. That\u2019s pretty low. I would anticipate that you\u2019ll see some increase in that rate during 2013 just because it\u2019s at a historically low level.<br><br>I think even in 2013 you\u2019re looking at a level that\u2019s going to be in the low fours. So we\u2019re not looking for some change in the underlying credit dynamics of either of our card portfolios.<br><br><strong>Operator</strong><br><br>Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA.<br><br><strong>Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA</strong><br><br>John, if you could just clarify, what was the return on tangible equity for Citigroup, however you look at it, excluding all the noise? \u00a0What was ROTE for last year or the fourth quarter or both?<br><br><strong>John Gerspach</strong><br><br>Well, I think it\u2019s \u2013 I don\u2019t have that number, Mike. I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s somewhere in the 5% range, I believe, for the full firm, for the full year. I just don\u2019t have the specifics.<br><br><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong><br><br>And assume it\u2019s 5% for the whole firm, what would it be just for Citicorp?<br><br><strong>John Gerspach</strong><br><br>We don\u2019t break out TC. We don\u2019t apportion the TCE as you know to the various operating segments.<br><br><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong><br><br>And John, just in very simple terms, maybe as a summary comment, your reserve release declined from around $900 million down to $100 million or $0.19 down to $0.02. Why was reserve release so much less?<br><br><strong>John Gerspach</strong><br><br>Unfortunately, Mike, it\u2019s not going to be a very simple comment. But I guess if I was going to break it down, it would be that there were some episodic releases in the third quarter which did not repeat. Don\u2019t forget in the third quarter we called out that we had a $600 million reserve release in that third quarter specifically related to increased net credit losses that we were \u2013 that the rest of the industry was forced to incur by some new guidance issued by the OCC.<br><br>The loan loss reserve release associated with cards has been tracking down, as we talked about. I think if you take a look at the cards book, we released about $800 million of reserves in the second quarter, about $550 million in the third quarter and now we\u2019re down in that $200 million to $300 million range in the fourth quarter and that\u2019s where we think we\u2019re going to be going forward.<br><br>So we reached where we\u2019re going to be in cards. The rest of it is just a lot of individual noise around the portfolio. Take a look at international consumer. Our international consumer, we had a $100 million net reserve build in that business in the quarter. That\u2019s due to the growth in those portfolios.<br><br>So unfortunately, there isn\u2019t a one sentence answer that I can give you on that. It\u2019s just a collection of how we take a look at \u2013 it\u2019s a collective view and an individual view of each portfolio.<br><br><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong><br><br>And then for Mike, I asked this question when you first got the CEO job. If in five years from now you were to look back at your performance, what would you want to see to show that you were successful?<br><br><strong>Mike Corbat</strong><br><br>I think probably going back to your first line of questioning, we\u2019ve got to get to a point where we stop destroying our shareholders\u2019 capital. I would say that would certainly be at the top of the list, that we run a smart and efficient business that\u2019s good at its allocation of its resources around its customer and client segments, that it\u2019s continued to have the ability to lead in a company those clients around the world, that it served the social purpose. There\u2019s several things in there.<br><br><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong><br><br>And then for us, the investors, I guess that, in turn, would lead to a higher stock price. Is that I guess a secondary focus to do everything else right?<br><br><strong>Mike Corbat</strong><br></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I wouldn\u2019t call it a secondary focus. We understand why we come to work, and it\u2019s a primary focus.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">The reason I ask, I mean as a new CEO, you have so many options of what you could do with the stock price. You could have all the directors take a lot of stock, and you\u2019ve had some CEOs take their personal net worth and buy extra stock, and as investors I think that\u2019s a huge focus. I guess whenever you\u2019ve done your review, perhaps we\u2019d hear more about what you might do along those lines. Is that a safe assumption? </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes. </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. And would you ever consider having a target of where you\u2019d want the stock price to be? In other words, if you\u2019re looking for higher returns on equity, and you get the business mix that you ultimately want, and the efficiency and the capital allocation, would you have a target in mind? Or is that just left up to the stock market to kind of let the valuation fall wherever it will? </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I think we need to look at all the metrics that are out there. You talked to one of the challenges of that particular metric in terms of how the market is approaching certain things, but it\u2019s obviously something we need to keep in mind.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy - RBC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Can you share with us on the sale of the assets out of Citi Holdings the pricing trends that you\u2019re seeing compared to the sales of the delinquent mortgage sales, for example, that you\u2019ve sold in the past? I think through the third quarter it was over $14 billion. Are you seeing better pricing now that the markets have improved a bit? </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Pricing did improve slightly in the fourth quarter. I\u2019ll tell you that. I wouldn\u2019t say that it went up by leaps and bounds, but it definitely improved over the levels, certainly, that we saw at the beginning of the third quarter. I\u2019d say the pricing on some of those asset sales improved toward the end of the third, and then held up in the fourth, is the way that I would characterize it. </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy - RBC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay, and did you finance any of the sales of the assets in the quarter? </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">No. </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy - RBC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Would that be a consideration of yours on a go-forward basis, to help accelerate the disposition of some of those assets? </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Actually we\u2019ve done that in the past, if you look at some of the deals that we\u2019ve announced. We\u2019ve actually taken on those financings, in certain amounts, in order to make sure that the deals would go. So that is not something that we would shy away from. Again, it\u2019s a matter of being the right deal, the right price. Think in terms of what we always say, economically rational. </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy - RBC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Sure. Shifting away for a moment to the net interest margin, your interest-bearing liability cost in the quarter, when we look at it with and without the FDIC insurance, is higher than some of your competitors. Is there an opportunity to bring those costs down, or is it just because of your global footprint, you just need to pay higher costs in markets outside the U.S.? </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I think that we, especially on the international deposits, I still think that we\u2019ve got some opportunity. We\u2019ve probably got some more opportunity on the international deposits to bring some pricing down than we do on the domestic deposits. As long as we stay in low interest rate environments in those countries, I do think that we\u2019ve still got some opportunities. We continue to reposition those books away from time deposits. </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So if you take a look at what goes on in Asia in particular, or specifically, even what we would consider to be normal checking accounts here in the States, which don\u2019t bear interest, a lot of the checking accounts in foreign countries do bear interest. So as you start to grow those checking balances, you\u2019re going to, even though they\u2019re operating accounts, see an increase in your interest bearing. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">The trick is to make sure that you\u2019re growing the real operating accounts and shifting the mix away from time deposits, which have much higher rates than just the base checking account. So even within something that gets reported as interest bearing deposits, there\u2019s a mix shift that you can still work on, and we\u2019re certainly in the process of doing that. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy - RBC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And one last question on the balance sheet. What\u2019s the duration now of the securities portfolio, in years? </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I\u2019ll focus on the AFS portfolio that we sort of use for the excess liquidity. I think we used to say it was slightly under two years. Now I would characterize  it as being slightly over two years but it\u2019s still roughly in that two-year tenor.<br><br><strong>Gerard Cassidy - RBC</strong><br><br>Then one final question for Mike, in looking at over the next two to three, maybe even five years, when you look to increase shareholders\u2019 wealth, is there \u2013 would you consider every spinning off or selling parts of some of your assets such as your bank in Mexico, for example.<br><br>We all know how well Mexico\u2019s doing and it doesn\u2019t seem like Citigroup is getting enough credit for its position down there. How do you try to capture those assets that might not be recognized today by the market?<br><br><strong>Mike Corbat</strong><br><br>I think when you look at the way we come to work, we think our strength comes from our global network and the interconnectivity of our network and our ability, as we\u2019ve described it, to lead in a company our clients and customers around the world and that\u2019s products, that\u2019s businesses. And we think that the value lies in that, point one.<br><br>Point two, I\u2019d say that in many ways, our model is becoming more unique and has the ability to even become more valued over time. So if you look at where I just came from in Europe to deleveragings, regulation in many cases are \u2013 in some cases are forcing some firms to abandon global strategies, in some cases to abandon regional strategies.<br><br>And I think that the importance of a bank that can do the things that we do for its global clients is only becoming more valuable and we think that the future lies in that. So we\u2019re committed to that and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to continue to invest in.<br><br><strong>Operator</strong><br><br>Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby \u2013 Guggenheim.<br><br><strong>Marty Mosby \u2013 Guggenheim</strong><br><br>I wanted to ask you a couple specific questions and then ask Mike a very broad, strategic question. If you look at the $1.3 billion of expenses related to the litigation and foreclosure settlement, can you break that out between Citi Holdings and what was in Citicorp?<br><br><strong>John Gerspach</strong><br><br>I think that\u2019s already broken out for you on one of the first slides that we got in the presentation package. I think if you look at Slide 4 \u2026<br><br><strong>Marty Mosby - Guggenheim</strong><br><br>I\u2019m sorry. I got that. If you look at the loss improvement that you saw in Citi Holdings, we talked a lot about release of allowance but when you\u2019re starting to look at the actual charges and the losses coming down, can you give us a little bit more color about what\u2019s driving that and how sustainable this new low level of losses would be?<br><br><strong>John Gerspach</strong><br><br>When you\u2019re talking about the low level of losses, Marty, I assume you\u2019re referring to the net credit losses that we \u2026<br><br><strong>Marty Mosby - Guggenheim</strong><br><br>That\u2019s correct, yes, and about a 46% drop that we saw there this quarter.<br><br><strong>John Gerspach</strong><br><br>Yes, and as we said, we try to give you a little bit more color on that on the following slide, Slide 20, where we break out the net credit losses on mortgages which constitute the \u2013 certainly the vast majority of the NCLs in that business.<br><br>Mortgages basically constitute three-quarters of the NCLs that we have in Holdings and I think you see a fairly clear trend on that page.<br><br>Now, we certainly \u2013 again, given the current environment and where we see things today, we would anticipate some continued improvement in those trends.<br><br><strong>Marty Mosby - Guggenheim</strong><br><br>And then lastly, the strategic question is as we\u2019ve structured the management team, it\u2019s kind of a traditional consumer versus business type of structure. How do you foresee driving the businesses such that you can make sure the focus in those two units and the cost sale and the relationship building continues to move forward and maybe evolve as a culture that is a little bit more traditional banking in nature as you continue to build out the new direction?<br><br><strong>Mike Corbat</strong><br><br>So if you look, Marty, what we announced is we announced co-presidents of the company, Jamie and Manuel each running in essence global products and coverage organizations, Manuel on the consumer side, Jamie on the institutional side.<br><br>And in those roles, they\u2019ve got all of the products reporting into them. So you can then go to the next level and, look, we did what we did as part of the reconstructive operations in technology. Obviously operations in technology are critical parts of the operating businesses that we\u2019re in.<br><br>So in 2008 and 2009, we actually pulled operations back from being embedded in the businesses, I think to reset the functions around the controls we saw necessary going into the more challenged environment, as well as to be mindful around costs and bloat that we thought had existed. </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I think we\u2019re at a point today, after making what I would characterize as good progress against those, whereas we look at business decisions that need to be made and where we want to make investment, and how we\u2019re going to spend those dollars, I think those become not just operations technology, safety, and soundness decisions, but they become more broadly business decisions, and I want Jamie and Manuel thinking about that. </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So in my earlier comment that Manuel has got to take our consumer business to scale around a drive toward common in our consumer franchise, and that Jamie\u2019s got to continue to wring the synergies of what I call adjacencies amongst our businesses, our client sets, out, and to make sure that we can provide the things we need, we can develop the things we need, but we can do them in an efficient way. And so I think the part of the organization attempts to dictate and drive that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">From a geographical perspective, I had the four large region heads reporting to me as well, and when you think about the balance in an organization, you want the balance between your products and your geographies, and obviously the third piece around your clients. And you\u2019re just going to make better decisions. </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">When I can look at what\u2019s going on in the products, and I can measure what\u2019s going on in the geographies, and I can see what our clients, and in particular our global clients, are doing around the world, we can just make better decisions about where we want to be, how we want to be there, and where we want to use our resources. </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Marty Mosby \u2013 Guggenheim</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And would you say profitability, as we manage or monitor that, being focused on those two big pieces primarily, meaning consumer and commercial? Or still kind of a matrix approach across all of the different geographies, products, and all that? Or are those two business units really, with what you\u2019re breaking out, going to drive the profitability overall? </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">No, I think as a company that comes to work in a hundred companies around the world every day, we\u2019ve got to have a balance between geography and product. Our products are global, many of them are world-class. We\u2019ve got to make sure that that gets celebrated and used in the right way. </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And I\u2019ll go back to the example I\u2019ve used before, that when we think of EMEA, where I came from, we operate in 55 countries, and we come to work very differently in most of those countries. And so if you\u2019re going to make sure you get the most out of your franchise, you\u2019ve got to be mindful of that, and make sure that you\u2019re driving the metrics and holding people accountable for the things that you need to do. </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">If not, what you tend to see is you tend to see style drift, or you tend to see the business start to veer into activities that really aren\u2019t core to its overall mission and principles. And having spent three or four years trying to clean that up, I\u2019m not anxious or willing to go back there. </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Marty Mosby \u2013 Guggenheim</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And then lastly, and thanks for your time here, when you look at just the business lines and segments that are reported, do you see any changes related to that in relation to the changes that you made here in management? </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I think right now we\u2019re focused on the metrics that really drive these businesses. I think over time, as always, we need to make sure that our reporting structure matches our management structure, and I think today it does. So I\u2019m comfortable with it, but over time we\u2019ll continue to reassess that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Just on the lines of some of those questions that you\u2019ve been getting, are there significant businesses that you think you would consider exiting? And as you think about savings, do you see them more U.S. or non-U.S. following this down payment that you talk about? </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">You characterize it as a down payment. I didn\u2019t. I think that we went through an extensive, exhaustive amount of work around the work for the 2013 budget. And again, I think we made a number of decisions in terms of what it was we felt we needed to do, and what were the right choices around those things. </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Again, I think as we go forward, I don\u2019t want to be in a position, or the company to be in a position, where we do these in one-offs. It\u2019s got to be BAU, we\u2019ve got to continually be assessing how, and where, and with whom, and in what ways we\u2019re using our resources. And that\u2019s got to be driven and compared at the business level, and I think that\u2019s got to be something that\u2019s ongoing rather than either being done on an occasional basis or in a step function basis. </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Vivek Juneja \u2013 JPMorgan</strong><br><br>When you talk about individual country \u2013 when you talk about having all these metrics that you\u2019re going to put out, are you going to vary them by country because obviously individual country dynamics vary a lot, your market position varies a lot.<br><br>So some countries, even on that \u2013 based on that, you\u2019re not going to be able to have the same efficiency ratio as the most efficient bank. So are you going to be customizing it that way or are you going to drive more top of the house and, if so, what level do you intend to share with us when you do?<br><br><strong>Mike Corbat</strong><br><br>Well, I think that we need to \u2013 and we\u2019ve already started the work around the country strategies and, again, we come to work as you described, in many places in very different ways and, therefore, the things that we want to hold people accountable for and the things we want to measure need to vary and that\u2019s the direction that we\u2019re taking the firm.<br><br>I think in terms of sharing those metrics at a granular basis I don\u2019t \u2013 being in a 100 countries, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s something that we would care to do or probably in some ways you would find worthwhile.<br><br>But certainly at the top of the house, which will be a roll up rather than drive down. We\u2019ll be choosing those metrics that we want to share with you.<br><br><strong>Vivek Juneja \u2013 JPMorgan</strong><br><br>Maybe at a continent level like you do right now, like Asia, Latin America, that kind of?<br><br><strong>Mike Corbat</strong><br><br>Again, we\u2019re working on metrics and over the next couple of months we\u2019ll be out with some things.<br><br><strong>Vivek Juneja \u2013 JPMorgan</strong><br><br>John, a couple of questions for you. When you look at your Basel III capital ratio, your assets seem to have come down more than RWA. Did something change to cause the fact that the RWA didn\u2019t come down as much, especially given that you reduced assets in Citi Holdings which should actually have a higher risk rate associated with them?<br><br><strong>John Gerspach</strong><br><br>Except, Vivek, it\u2019s not every asset in Citi Holdings is weighted the exact same. So I would say that for this quarter, when you take a look at the total amount, the $15 billion that came down, some of it was in lower risk weighted assets or more favorably risk weighted assets than at the higher end. And it\u2019s just simply that. It\u2019s just a matter of mix.<br><br><strong>Vivek Juneja \u2013 JPMorgan</strong><br><br>But on top of that, you came down 50 plus (inaudible) in Citicorp, so I would have thought that at the very least you would have come down by \u2013 I guess what you\u2019re saying is what you\u2019re coming down is much lower risk weighted even in Citicorp, that\u2019s why your RWA is not coming down that much.<br><br><strong>John Gerspach</strong><br><br>Think about the reductions that we made in cash. It took $60 billion, so.<br><br><strong>Vivek Juneja \u2013 JPMorgan</strong><br><br>DTA, the disallowed amount, John, went up by $2 billion. What did the total amount of DTA do?<br><br><strong>John Gerspach</strong><br><br>Total amount of DTA in the quarter increased by about $2 billion.<br><br><strong>Vivek Juneja \u2013 JPMorgan</strong><br><br>And now what? \u00a0$56 million?<br><br><strong>John Gerspach</strong><br><br>I\u2019m sorry, sir.<br><br><strong>Vivek Juneja \u2013 JPMorgan</strong><br><br>Is that about $56 million?<br><br><strong>John Gerspach</strong><br><br>About $55.3 million I think will be the number that will be in the K.<br><br><strong>Vivek Juneja \u2013 JPMorgan</strong><br><br>And lastly, just a clarification on a comment you made earlier, so you expect legal related charges to continue at a $600 million to $700 million rate going forward? \u00a0Did I hear that correctly?<br><br><strong>John Gerspach</strong><br><br>No, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what you heard at all, Vivek. What I said was that the legal and related expenses are going to stay elevated and somewhat volatile but that we certainly didn\u2019t expect the $1.3 billion of expense that we had in the fourth quarter to represent a new norm.<br><br><strong>Operator</strong><br><br>Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom \u2013 SunTrust.<br><br><strong>Eric Wasserstrom \u2013 SunTrust</strong><br><br>John, just \u2013 this is just more of a structural question but if I did my numbers correctly in each of the major business lines within Citicorp, generated between let\u2019s call it 1% and 9% in positive operating leverage year-over-year. Do those figures sound about correct to you?<br><br><strong>John Gerspach</strong><br><br>Yes, yes, roughly. I don\u2019t have it in my head, so each one was positive.<br><br><strong>Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust</strong><br><br>So I guess my real question is this. And those numbers, the only adjustment I made was to exclude CVA and DBA but nothing else about what you might consider non-recurring or otherwise diminishing environmental expenses.<br><br><strong>John Gerspach</strong><br><br>So the only difference between the way that I would have explained it and probably the way I would think of it is I would also adjust for the fourth quarter repositioning which ran $1 billion or so in the fourth quarter of this year compared to $400 million. But if that the only adjustment that we\u2019re differing on? We\u2019re not going to get that wide of a gap.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><br><strong>Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust</strong><br><br>So the heart of my question is this, since we generally agree on that point: It would seem, then, that given what you\u2019ve articulated with respect to additional expense initiatives and some of the benefits of the repositioning action and some of the things that are being undertaken in Asia, etc., even in the context of a difficult rate environment, doesn\u2019t it then suggest that we\u2019re going to see continued operating leverage across these business lines over \u201913 in let\u2019s call it a static environment?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">The answer to that is, I\u2019m not going to say in business by business, because spread compression is going to hit you differently in different businesses, and I think we\u2019ve seen that. Certainly in Transaction Services, if you\u2019re not able to offset spread compression, but the volume, you can have the impact of spread compression, you know, it will take away revenues without impacting your level of volume. </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And so therefore, you\u2019re really running the same stuff through your shop. So your ability to take expense out is then just limited to your ability to generate reengineering savings, which may or may not be enough to offset the impact of the spread compression.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So in general, you know, you\u2019re thinking about it the right way, but it is somewhat dependent business by business, and it\u2019s also dependent upon the magnitude of the spread compression that is impacting each business. </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><br><strong>Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust</strong><br><br>And then just to follow up on that, outside of spread compression, which is obviously something that you [unintelligible], what then would be, in your mind, the other big risk factors that would disrupt the realization of positive operating leverage across the various businesses? </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Well, general economics. If our customers aren\u2019t growing their businesses, if our customers have a change in sentiment as far as how they view the general economy and cut back on either savings or borrowing or any of that, that certainly is a risk factor. </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><br><strong>Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust</strong><br><br>So it sounds like outside of deterioration in the broader macro-environment, what you\u2019re suggesting is the spread issue remains a serious one to look at, but other than that, we should probably be thinking about continued low single digit operating leverage expansion. </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Although I probably will be directing you to make sure that you do a thorough reading of every risk factor that we publish in the 400-page 10-K that we\u2019ll be delivering to you at some point in time in the next 45 days or so. </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><br><strong>Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust</strong><br><br>Well, I look forward to that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Marquardt with Evercore Partners. </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Just following on that line of questioning, on expenses, can you talk about the areas that you\u2019re most focused on investing? You talked about, obviously, cost saves and there\u2019s more to come, it sounds like, after this first cut, but the investment spend that you need to focus on to drive the volume and the revenue, can you talk a little bit about where you\u2019re most focused? </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Sure, so we\u2019re focused in a few areas. One is in the operations and technology area in terms of continuing to combine, streamline, develop, and roll out common systems around our global network. I think that would be one significant area where we\u2019ve made investment. We\u2019re going to need the continue to make investment. We\u2019re always investing in our people, in terms of wanting to continue to retain and attract talent, and in particular in our institutional parts of our business, we\u2019ll be continuing to invest in the build-out of our commodities businesses around the world. We\u2019ll continue to be investing in digital and digitization around our consumer banking. I\u2019d say those are probably a few of the more significant investments. </p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And then regionally, if we were just to focus on the global consumer bank, it sounds like you\u2019re turning the corner in terms of revenue in Asia and Lat-Am remains very strong. How should we think about revenue in North America? </p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I think from a North American \u2013 in particular, I would say US consumer perspective, I think the environment, while John spoke to some of the positive attributes, I think that needs to be balanced with some of the realities of the low interest rate environment.<br><br>I think that as others have forecasted and I think that we see is a slowing in terms of the mortgage refinance boom and the economics that have been associated with that. I think those are two reasonable headwinds that we\u2019re going to have to overcome in 2013 in North America consumer.<br><br><strong>Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners</strong><br><br>Outside of mortgage, can the cards business \u2013 should we think about that actually growing this year or still needed?<br><br><strong>Mike Corbat</strong><br><br>I think we\u2019ve done a lot of work. We\u2019ve made fresh and we\u2019ve stabilized the portfolio. We\u2019ve got to get growth back into it and that\u2019s going to be a focus.<br><br><strong>Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners</strong><br><br>And then just lastly, as you\u2019re going through your ongoing business reviews and work on operational efficiencies, have you had a chance to get a sense of longer term, the all-in earnings power of the franchise? Will you also be updating us on your views on that longer term?<br><br>I guess historically you guys have talked about it an ROA 125, 150. Is that still applicable or should we wait for an update?<br><br><strong>Mike Corbat</strong><br><br>I think \u2013 addressing those questions in reverse order \u2013 I think that the ROA 125 to 150 in this environment is not a practical goal to set out there in the short term. So we\u2019ll be resetting that.<br><br>I think we\u2019ll be coming out over the next coming months, as I said, with some things that we\u2019re going to be measured against and we\u2019ll try and lay that out and show you best we can the path for the company going forward.<br><br><strong>Operator</strong><br><br>And you have no further questions. Do you have any closing remarks?<br><br><strong>Susan Kendall</strong><br><br>Hi, yes, thanks, operator. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today.

Today\u2019s call will be hosted by Susan Kendall, head of Citi Investor Relations.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Ms. Kendall, you may begin.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Susan Kendall</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Mike Corbat, will speak first. Then John Gerspach, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation, which is available for download on our website,  citigroup.com. Afterwards, we\u2019ll be happy to take questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation may contain forward-looking statements which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results in capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2011 Form 10-K.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you, Susan.  Good morning everyone.  This morning we reported earnings of $3.8 billion for the first quarter of 2013.  Excluding CVA and DVA, net income was $4 billion, or $1.29 per share.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">During the quarter, we benefited from seasonally strong results in our markets businesses, sustained momentum in investment banking, and continued year over year growth in loans and deposits in Citicorp, in a more favorable credit environment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">As I\u2019ve said, achieving consistent high quality earnings is one of my top priorities, and these first quarter results are encouraging.  However, although this was a good start for 2013, the environment remains challenging, and we\u2019re sure to be tested as we go through the year ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">In addition to our performance across business lines, there were several other areas that I\u2019d want to point out.  First, our capital strength again improved during the quarter with the tier one common ratio increasing to an estimated 9.3% on a Basel III basis, and we now expect the ratio to reach at least 10% by the end of this year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">After a very thorough process, we were pleased that our regulators did not object to the capital plan we submitted, and although the requested returns were modest, the permission to do so, which was based on both quantitative and qualitative analysis, is meaningful.  As I said on my first earnings call, it\u2019s critical that Citi be viewed as an indisputably strong and stable institution and we made progress toward that goal during the first quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Next, as I\u2019ve highlighted, we have two areas of intense focus for our company: to reduce the drag on earnings caused by Citi Holdings, and to utilize our deferred tax assets.  We made progress on both fronts.  We reduced our assets in Citi Holdings by $7 billion.  Holdings assets now total just under $150 billion, or 8% of our balance sheet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">And more importantly, the loss in holdings was reduced to less than $800 million, driven by improvement in credit costs, including a $375 million reserve release related to North American mortgages.  And we began utilizing reserves as the mortgage portfolio continues to shrink, credit performance continues to improve, and we become more comfortable that the housing recovery is sustainable.  As a result, we will continue to analyze this portfolio and adjust our reserve levels accordingly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We also did consume a small amount of our DTA during the first quarter.  $700 million of DTA was utilized, and we\u2019re focused on generating sustainable U.S. taxable earnings which are the primary driver of DTA consumption.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Lastly, I said on my first earnings presentation that I would soon announce the metrics by which you can measure our progress.  Last month I presented three targets we aim to reach by the end of 2015.  First is achieving an efficiency ratio in Citicorp in the mid-50% range.  Second, we want to generate a return on Citigroup\u2019s tangible common equity of over 10%, and third is reaching a return on Citigroup\u2019s assets of between 90 and 110 basis points in a risk-balanced manner.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">These goals will not be easily reached on a full year basis, but they\u2019re the right ones for our company, given the environment.  And as I\u2019ve said, you are what you measure, and we will hold ourselves accountable.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We\u2019re executing the repositioning plan we announced in December, but as I\u2019ve said, driving efficiency needs to be business as usual, and we\u2019re working hard to ingrain that into the organization.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">To that end, as you may have heard last week, we\u2019ll remove a layer of management in our institutional clients group so that our six principal lines of business will report directly to Jamie Forese.  This simplification preserves the businesses which are core to our unparalleled global network and will lead to better integration in service of our institutional clients.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Looking ahead, I believe the environment is going to remain challenging.  Europe\u2019s issues, as the situation in Cypress shows, still have the potential to rattle the markets and impact investor confidence.  At best, the Euro Zone is in a period of austerity instead of growth, and the ongoing low rate environment, new regulation, and cost of putting certain legacy issues behind us will continue to put pressure on our earnings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">But I am confident we\u2019re on the right course, and I look forward to sharing our progress with you in the coming quarters.  Now John will go over the slides, and then we\u2019d be happy to answer any of your questions.  John?</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Thank you, Mike, and good morning everyone.  To start, I\u2019d like to highlight some significant items affecting our results this quarter.  First, CVA and DVA were negative $319 million pretax, and $198 million after tax, in the first quarter, for a negative impact on EPS of $0.06.  For comparison purposes, in the first quarter of 2012 CVA and DVA were negative $1.3 billion pretax, or $800 million after tax, for a negative impact of $0.27 per share.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In addition, in the first quarter of 2012, we recorded a pretax gain of roughly $475 million related to the sale of minority investments, which had a positive impact on EPS of $0.10 per share in that quarter.  Adjusting for CVA/DVA, we earned $4 billion in the first quarter of 2013, or $1.29 per share, as compared to $1.11 per share on an adjusted basis in the first quarter of 2012.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Throughout today\u2019s earnings presentation, I will be discussing our results excluding CVA/DVA, and gains or losses on the sale of minority investments to provide comparability to prior periods.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In addition, as shown on slide four, there are a few other significant items which are included in our results.  First, operating expenses in the first quarter included legal and related costs of over $700 million, compared to nearly $1.3 billion last quarter and $545 million in the prior year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Legal and related costs in Citicorp were down significantly in the first quarter, to $66 million.  However, Citi Holdings\u2019 legal expenses increased to over $600 million, primarily reflecting higher legacy legal expenses in the special asset pool.  Legal and related costs will likely continue to be elevated, and volatile, as we continue to put our legacy issues behind us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Second, repositioning costs were $148 million in the first quarter, compared to $1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2012 and $66 million in the first quarter of last year.  Given the higher than normal repositioning costs in the fourth quarter, today I\u2019ll be discussing our results excluding the charges in that quarter to provide comparability.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">And finally, the loan loss reserve release in the first quarter was $652 million, including a release of roughly $375 million related to the North America mortgage portfolio in Citi Holdings.  In total, the net reserve release was $86 million in the prior quarter, and nearly $1.2 billion in the first quarter of last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On slide five, we show total Citigroup results for the quarter.  Revenues of $20.8 billion grew 3% from last year, while operating expenses of $12.4 billion increased 1%, driven by the higher legal and related costs in Citi Holdings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Excluding legal and related costs and repositioning charges, core operating expenses were $11.5 billion in the first quarter, down slightly from the prior year.  Looking forward, core operating expenses should decline as we begin to see the benefits of the repositioning actions announced last December.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Credit costs of $2.5 billion declined 16% versus last year.  Net credit losses of $3 billion were down 25%.  However, the loan loss reserve release also declined by nearly half, to $652 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We earned $4 billion of net income in the first quarter, or $1.29 per share, up from $1.11 per share last year on a comparable basis, driven by revenue growth and lower net credit losses, partially offset by the increase in legal and related expenses and a lower net loan loss reserve release.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Our effective tax rate was also higher in the first quarter, at 29% versus 27% last year.  We expect our full year tax rate to be in the range of 30% in 2013, as a result of both higher expected earnings in North America as well as a higher tax rate on international operations.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">The increased rate on earnings outside North America is due to a change in our assertion that earnings in certain entities would be permanently reinvested outside the U.S.  As we have built up capital in these entities that is adequate to support future investments, we now believe that current and future earnings in these entities could be repatriated at some point.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Citigroup end of period loans were flat year over year at $646 billion in the first quarter, as growth in Citicorp was offset by the [line] down of Citi Holdings.  And deposits grew 3% to $934 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On slide six, we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings.  Citicorp generated first quarter revenues of $19.9 billion, and net income of $4.8 billion.  Year over year, revenues grew 2% and expenses declined by 2%, driven by lower legal and related expenses in Citicorp.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Credit costs increased modestly year over year, as a decline in net credit losses was more than offset by lower reserve releases.  And we continue to grow loans year over year in each core business.  Total Citicorp loans grew 5%, with consumer loans up 1% and corporate loans up 9%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Citi Holdings had revenues of $910 million, and a net loss of $788 million, a significant improvement from prior periods, driven by lower credit costs.  Citi Holdings ended the quarter with $149 billion of assets, down $60 billion, or 29%, year over year.  At quarter end, Citi Holdings accounted for just under 8% of total Citigroup assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning now to Citicorp, on slide seven we show Citicorp\u2019s pretax earnings by business, excluding the impact of loan loss reserves, on a trailing 12-month basis.  Through the first quarter, pretax earnings grew to $21 billion, an increase of nearly 30% over the prior year 12 months, driven by consumer banking and securities and banking.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Slide eight shows the results for North America consumer banking.  Total revenues of $5.1 billion in the first quarter were down 1% year over year.  In retail banking, revenues were down 3%, as loan and deposit growth was more than offset by spread compression in this low rate environment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Cards revenues, on the other hand, were flat versus last year, as lower average loan balances were largely offset by an improvement in net interest spreads, as we benefited from both an improvement in yields as well as lower funding costs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Sequentially, total revenues declined 4%, on lower mortgage gain on sale margins as well as seasonally lower cards revenues.  Total operating expenses of $2.4 billion were up 4% year over year, reflecting higher volume-related costs and repositioning charges, partially offset by efficiency savings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On a sequential basis, expenses declined on lower legal and related costs.  Credit costs of roughly $900 million dollars increased 12% year over year.  Net credit losses declined by 23% to $1.3 billion, driven by an improvement in cards.  However, the net loan loss reserve release was significantly lower at $370 million this quarter.  Earnings before tax, excluding the impact of loan loss reserves, increased by nearly 20% to $1.4 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Overall, we continue to see progress in our North America consumer franchise.  Average deposits continue to grow, up 10% year over year, including 17% growth in checking account balances.  In branded cards, accounts also grew, up 3% from last year.  And, for both card portfolios, we saw continued expansion in net interest spreads.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On slide nine, we show results for international consumer banking in constant dollars.  On this basis, both revenues and expenses grew 3% year over year.  In Latin America, revenues grew 6% and expenses were up 7% from last year, as spread compressions slowed revenue growth while volumes remained strong.  In Asia, revenues were down slightly versus last year, and expenses were flat.  And in EMEA, revenues grew 2%, with a 2% decline in expenses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">While international consumer revenues continued to reflect spread compression in certain markets, as well as the impact of regulatory changes, particularly in Asia, most underlying drivers showed sustained momentum in the first quarter.  Total average loans grew 4% from last year.  Card purchase sales were up 7%, and investment sales grew 24% year over year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Based on this continued volume growth, as well as the expected efficiency savings, we currently believe both Latin America and Asia will return to positive operating leverage on a full year basis in 2013.  Credit costs of $829 million in the first quarter were up 6% from last year, on higher net credit losses due mostly to loan growth and portfolio seasoning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Slide ten shows our international consumer credit trends in more detail.  Credit quality in our international consumer portfolio remained strong in the first quarter, with stable to improving credit trends on a sequential basis across each region.  In Asia, the NCL rate returned to below 1%, with 90-plus day delinquencies at around 50 basis points.  And, in Latin America, the NCL rate was fairly stable at 4.6%.  We continue to believe that the NCL rate in Latin America should normalize around 4.5% by the second half of 2013.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Slide 11 shows our securities and banking business.  Revenues of $7.3 billion grew 8% from last year, and 50% from the prior quarter.  Investment banking revenues of $1.1 billion were up 22% from the prior year, with higher revenues in all major products.  Revenues increased 6% sequentially, and overall investment banking wallet share continued to improve in the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Equity market revenues of $826 million were down 10% from last year, due in part to the impact of lower volatility on derivatives revenues, and increased 78% from the fourth quarter, on higher cash equity volumes and improved derivatives performance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Fixed income market revenues of $4.6 billion declined 3% from last year as rates and currencies revenues were down from a very strong prior year period, partially offset by growth in securitized products.  Sequentially, fixed income revenues were up 69% on improved results across all products.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Lending revenues, excluding the impact of gains and losses on hedges related to accrual loans, were $333 million in the first quarter, down 7% from last year, primarily related to loan sale activity and down 12% sequentially on lower average loans and a slight decline in spreads.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Total operating expenses of $3.6 billion were down 4% from last year, and up 4% sequentially, reflecting higher incentive compensation.  Net income of $2.5 billion grew 17% year over year, and more than doubled versus the prior quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Moving to transaction services, on slide 12, revenues of $2.6 billion were down 4% from last year on a reported basis and down 2% in constant dollars.  Treasury and trade solutions was down 3% in constant dollars, as loan and deposit growth was more than offset by the impact of spread compression globally. And, securities and fund services revenues grew 2% in constant dollars, as higher settlement volumes and fees more than offset lower spreads.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">While spread compression dampened revenues this quarter, the volume drivers for transaction services continued to show momentum.  Average trade loans grew 20% year over year, average deposits were up 10%, assets under custody grew by 8%, and SFS settlement volumes grew 5%.  Expenses of $1.4 billion were up 3% from last year on a reported basis, and up 4% in constant dollars, mainly on higher volumes, and down 5% sequentially due in part to lower legal and related costs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">While spread compression is likely to continue to impact revenues in the near term, we believe we can achieve revenue growth and a return to positive operating leverage on a full year basis in 2013.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Slide 13 shows the results for corporate other.  Revenues were flat versus the prior year, while expenses of $568 million declined 28% on lower legal and related expenses.  Assets of $280 billion included approximately $83 billion of cash and cash equivalents, and $143 billion of liquid available for sale securities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Slide 14 shows Citi Holdings assets.  We ended the quarter with assets of $149 billion in Citi Holdings, or roughly 8% of total Citigroup assets.  The $7 billion reduction in the first quarter reflected $2 billion of asset sales, $4 billion of net paydowns, and roughly $1 billion of cost of credit.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">As you can see on the slide, other assets in local consumer lending increased during the quarter, by nearly $3 billion.  These are primarily loans held for sale, where we were in the process of a transaction but had not yet closed as of quarter end.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On slide 15, we show Citi Holdings financial results for the quarter.  Total revenues of $910 million were up 15% year over year as higher revenues in the special asset pool were partially offset by a decline in local consumer lending, driven by declining loan balances.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Citi Holdings expenses increased 23% year over year, to $1.5 billion, driven by higher legal and related costs in the special asset pool.  Excluding these higher legal costs, core operating expenses declined 18% year over year to roughly $860 million.  This decline reflects declining assets as well as the expiration of certain transition services agreements related to prior sales activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Credit costs declined 44% year over year to roughly $750 million.  Net credit losses declined significantly to $930 million, and the net loan loss reserve release was over $350 million, including a release of roughly $375 million related to North America mortgages.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Looking at the past five quarters of Citi Holdings results on slide 16, rep and warranty reserve bills and legal and related costs continued to weigh on Citi Holdings.  On an operating basis, however, excluding these items and repositioning, we maintained a modest positive operating margin again in the first quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Credit trends were particularly favorable, with North America mortgage NCLs declining to $630 million, roughly 60% of which were offset by reserve releases.  We ended the quarter with $7.5 billion of loan loss reserves allocated to North America mortgage loans in Citi Holdings, or 36 months of coverage.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On slide 17, we show mortgage loan and adjusted net credit loss trends over the past two years.  Since the first quarter of 2011, we have reduced the North America mortgage loans in Citi Holdings by 28%, driven by $18 billion of paydowns, $8 billion of asset sales, and $8 billion of net losses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">In the first quarter, we sold $2.8 billion of loans, including $1 billion of delinquent mortgages and $1.8 billion of current loans.  A significant portion of the current loans were reperforming mortgages, where we had previously modified the loan and it subsequently remained current.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">While we are of course encouraged by the sale of these reperforming mortgages in the quarter, it is still unclear whether buyers will have an appetite for additional sales of this nature, and we will continue to test the market.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We have also significantly reduced the quarterly net credit losses in the portfolio, down 50% since the first quarter of 2011, to $630 million, even while roughly $76 million of losses were accelerated into the recent quarter as a result of the continued actions we are taking to fulfill our commitments under the National Mortgage Settlement, or NMS.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We expect to fulfill our obligations under NMS in the second quarter.  However, we will continue to modify loans under the OCC Foreclosure Review Settlement announced last quarter, which we estimate will pull forward $30-40 million of losses into each quarter for the remainder of 2013.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On slide 18, we show delinquency trends, including both residential first mortgages and home equity loans.  30-plus day delinquencies improved by 19% sequentially to $6.1 billion, with improvement in both portfolios.  Residential first mortgage delinquencies fell 20% sequentially to $4.8 billion, driven by asset sales as well as fewer new entries into the early buckets.  And, home equity delinquencies also improved by 15% to $1.2 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On slide 19, we show our net interest revenue and margin trends.  Net interest revenue was roughly flat year over year, at $11.9 billion, and declined 2% sequentially due to a lower day count.  Our net interest margin increased by 1 basis point to 294 basis points in the first quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On a full year basis, we believe we should be able to maintain our net interest margin above the 288 basis points we achieved last year.  However, there will be quarterly fluctuations and in particular, we expect the net interest margin to decline sequentially in the second quarter by a few basis points.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On slide 20, we show our key capital metrics through the first quarter.  Under Basel III, our estimated tier one common ratio increased to 9.3% versus 8.7% last quarter.  And, our Basel I tier one common ratio was 11.8%, including the impact of the market risk rules which became effective at the beginning of the quarter, up from 11.1% on a comparable basis last quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">In summary, our results for the first quarter reflected a continued challenging operating environment, with spread compression globally and elevated legal and related cost remaining as headwinds.  Against this backdrop, we continue to grow our core business while beginning to reduce the earning drag from Citi Holdings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">In securities and banking, we again demonstrated our ability to grow revenues while keeping expense discipline.  And, in consumer banking and transaction services, we continued to grow loans and deposits year over year while maintaining a high quality credit portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">In Citi Holdings, assets are now less than $150 billion, and the net loss was less than $800 million this quarter, even as we continue to face elevated legal and related costs.  And finally, our liquidity and capital positions remained strong, with estimated aggregate liquidity resources in excess of $370 billion and an estimated Basel III tier one common ratio of 9.3% at quarter end.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Looking forward, we remain confident in our ability to grow volumes to compensate for the impact of the low interest rate environment, and we remain on track to achieve the $900 million of efficiency savings expected this year from our previously announced repositioning actions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">With that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p7\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">[Operator instructions.]  Your first question will come from the line of Glenn Schorr with Nomura.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Glenn Schorr \u2013 Nomura</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">I like the disclosure.  On 17 you showed us that 60% NCLs were offset but loan loss reserve releases.  Between the sales and then just improving conditions in general, should we be thinking 60% offset is the right number, or should that grow over time as the portfolio shrinks and the market keeps getting better?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">If the portfolio continues to demonstrate improving credit trends, and if the housing market remains stable, you should assume that we would likely increase that percentage coverage as we move through the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">The comment that you made earlier related to the tax rate in certain international entities, is that a comment on thoughts on repatriation?  I guess it\u2019s the same question.  Is it all related to what I think is a growing subsidiarization trend, meaning the U.S. pushes foreign banks to hold more capital in the U.S. now?  Are other markets doing that?  How much is that a risk that we should be thinking of, trapped capital around the world for you guys?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">That is an ongoing area that I think everyone is looking at, but that\u2019s not what\u2019s driving this decision.  When you look at the requirements under APB 23, one of the things that you\u2019ve got to assert is that the capital in the offshore legal entities is to be permanently reinvested outside the states.  And specific legal entities, and think in terms of our bank in Singapore and our bank in Ireland, we\u2019ve built up now substantial capital.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And as you look at the capital levels, we have enough capital to meet the investment requirements that we see out into the future.  And so it\u2019s likely that at some point in time current earnings, and future earnings in those legal entities, could be repatriated into the states.  And therefore we\u2019re going to provide the U.S. taxes, and the differential between the U.S. tax rate and the local tax rate on those earnings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Post stress test, where you had super high capital ratios after the stress test, you have very high Basel III now, and growing pretty quickly.  That leads people towards getting really excited about next year\u2019s CCAR.  The question I have is how are the rating agencies thinking about removing some of the implicit government support and the OLA coming rules play into your role about Citi\u2019s ideal capital structure?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Those are all things that are developing and maybe will get further developed as 2013 unfolds.  For now, we\u2019re waiting to see what rules come out regarding OLA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Has there been any prefunding of it?  In other words, I thought I saw you do some subdebt issuance and your funding costs have come way down given your good performance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">To the extent that we\u2019ve had debt maturities, we\u2019ve rolled over some of those maturities, although we\u2019ve been in the process of reducing long term debt.  I think you\u2019ve seen us issue some preferred stock in the last couple of quarters.  You take a look at the capital structure we think preferred stock is a piece of that structure that we need to some issuance with as we think ahead to what the Basel III capital requirements are, not just for tier one common but also for tier one.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question will come from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">John, on the expenses, I was wondering, you mentioned that on the core expenses about $11.5 billion, we should start to see those start to come down as you get the repositioning benefits?  Is there a new range of core expenses we should think about over the next couple of quarters?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">No, we\u2019re staying with what we said at year-end, and you should expect, as we just said, to see the core expenses decline over the next couple of quarters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">From that $11.5 billion?  Is that right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And then on the legal repositioning side, I think you just said kind of volatile, and likely to remain elevated.  Is this the neighborhood we should kind of think about?  Or too tough to predict?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I\u2019d say it\u2019s kind of too tough to predict.  I think if you take a look at legal expenses, though, what did we run last year?  $2.8 billion for the full year or something like that?  And now you\u2019ve got $700 million or so in the first quarter.  I\u2019ll leave it at that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay, so you\u2019re running at the same pace as last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Roughly.  On average.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And then in terms of the net interest income, your net interest income dollars fell in the first quarter.  I assume there\u2019s some day count pressure.  And you mentioned the NIM outlook.  I was just wondering, though, if you hope to grow the net interest income dollars in 2013, given the earning asset expansion you\u2019re doing.  Do you expect the net interest income dollars to grow this year in 2013?  You were down on NII in the first quarter sequentially.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">You know, I don\u2019t give net interest revenue outlooks.  That kind of gets into really going forward-looking.  On a day count basis, though, if you take a look at the average net interest revenue for us, it was about $132 million in the fourth quarter, and the same number in the first quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And then last thing for me, on the DTA, can you give us some sense of the drivers of the consumption?  How much from improving just U.S. net income versus other factors that might have been at play?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yeah, if you look at the moving pieces of the DTA, there\u2019s about $100 million of DTA that was actually added by the CVA/DVA loss.  Citi Holdings losses added about $500 million of DTA, and then Citicorp earnings actually enabled us to consume about a billion dollars of DTA this quarter.  And then the balance of $300 million basically came out of OCI.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So hard to run rate this, or to give an outlook I guess.  It will still bounce around a little bit?  Do you have any outlook on the consumption or ability to consume?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">No, you have to think about it this way, as long as we can continue to do some growth in U.S. earnings, that should be helpful.  And that includes winding further wind downs in the Citi Holdings losses.  And also, the change in the APB 23 assertion, that change in the effective tax rate, on a dollar for dollar basis, those incremental taxes will also serve to offset the DTA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And where do we stand at quarter-end?  Do you have the numbers with you?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">It\u2019s down about $700 million, off the $55.3 [billion].  So I guess that makes it $54.6 [billion].</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question will come from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Just wanted to drill into the litigation charge, which went into SAP.  As you pointed out in that slide at the beginning, on the significant P&amp;L items, at least in the comparable periods, most of those significant legal charges were in Citicorp.  And I think you were carrying them in corp and other, if I remember right.  So the change in the geography, to put it in SAP, kind of indicates that there\u2019s something related to the type of assets that are in SAP.  Could you tell us a little bit more about what the, I guess probably $500 million or so implicit in SAP in those litigation charges are?  And is it a reserve build?  Or is there something specific that you\u2019re dealing with there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">We don\u2019t comment on specific legal accruals unless we\u2019re announcing a settlement of some sort.  But you think in terms of we certainly put the legal accruals in the business, during the segment, that is going to be impacted by the matter for which we\u2019re setting aside the legal reserves.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">If we look at the operating expenses in LCL, and we sort of look through some of the noise there, that\u2019s been running around a billion a quarter, and it came down to about $825 million.  Is that a step function that we should think about run rating as you are seeing meaningful reductions in, for example, foreclosure servicing and the like?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Certainly as we continue to sell off nonperforming loans, one of the benefits that we look to achieve by the sale of the nonperforming loans is to be able to bring down the servicing expenses on those loans.  I\u2019m not going to encourage you to necessarily run rate $825 million, but you can assume that one of the things that we aim to do through the loan sale is to target those loans that not only are producing higher levels of NCLs, but that come with them a higher level of servicing costs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Turning to Citicorp, and looking at global consumer in North America, I know it\u2019s not a real big thing, but you\u2019ve sustained a pretty steady growth rate of commercial markets loan assets.  I think you\u2019re up almost 20% year over year, to over $8 billion.  Again, it\u2019s not huge when you put it in the context of some of your competitors, but it\u2019s a pretty significant growth rate.  Is this an area that you\u2019ve been targeting for much more significant loan growth?  And how are you doing that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Actually, that\u2019s true.  That is an area that [CC] and her team have put particular focus on, over I\u2019ll say the last year, maybe it\u2019s been the last 15 months.  But that\u2019s definitely an area where we see an opportunity to expand.  And we\u2019ve grown both deposits and loans in that market.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And is it targeted to particular industries?  Is it largely branch-based?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">It\u2019s definitely branch-based, and there are certain industries that we have targeted.  I believe that, at least in the last couple of months, the small energy companies have been a particular standout for us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Final question is just on the cautious commentary.  Mike said something like we\u2019re sure to be tested.  And I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s anything specific that he\u2019s looking at there that is giving him pause?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I would say that as we look around the world, that you can just look at growth rate around the world and continue to see the world\u2019s a very uneven place, with growth rates in the emerging markets around 5%, growth rates in the developed market space around 1%.  And you can see the volatility and reactions, whether it\u2019s to slowing growth in China this morning, or whether it was Cypress issues.  And so I think the world continues to be somewhat of a fragile place, and I expect the markets to remain volatile.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question will come from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Quick question on the long term debt.  You guys reduced it about $85 billion last year.  It\u2019s certainly been helpful to the margin.  With OLA, or anything else like that, do you see that slowing this year?  What\u2019s the outlook on the long term debt?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We\u2019ll give a little more perspective on that when we do the fixed income call next week, but I think you can already see some slowdown.  I believe end of period, long term debt only came down about $5 billion or so quarter on quarter.  So we\u2019re not quite at the pace that we were last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So expect that sort of slower reduction from here?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">It certainly is not going to be at the pace it was last year.  That\u2019s for sure.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And just maybe on the capital side, is it still expected that when you finalize the deal with Morgan Stanley on the JV, it would add around 30 to 40 basis points to your Basel III ratio?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Assuming that Morgan Stanley would call the entire 35%, yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And then lastly, as the mortgage environment continues to look better, the housing environment, is there any improved outlook on some of the discrete assets and holdings, like One Main?  Clearly profitability seems to be improving there.  But I don\u2019t know how you guys feel about the funding markets and the ability for someone to buy that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We continue to look at all those, and as you\u2019ve seen, when the prices and the terms are right, we\u2019ll act against that.  Clearly the recovery in housing helps, not just the mortgage portfolio, but also helps on the consumer side in general.  And so we continue to watch that, but we\u2019ve got no reaction today to plans there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">A couple of questions.  One is, the S&amp;B expense ratio posted a very low 49%.  I\u2019m just wondering how you\u2019re thinking about what a normalized expense ratio should be in that segment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I think as we looked ahead, and you look out for 2015, we\u2019ve already given some degree of where we think the expense ratio should be longer term for securities and banking.  We said overall for Citicorp we would expect an efficiency ratio of 55%.  And I believe that embedded in that was an expense ratio less than 60% for securities and banking.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And the low ratio this quarter, you don\u2019t pay out on mark to market gains?  Is that right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I think it\u2019s awfully hard to judge long term efficiency ratios on one quarter.  So there\u2019s always going to be revenues that don\u2019t repeat, and there\u2019s an expense base that\u2019s fixed, and all things to be that.  I\u2019d love to have four quarters strung together like the first quarter, but that\u2019s not the way we\u2019ve actually built the expense base.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And then on the capital ratio, obviously strong increase this quarter, 50 basis points up in common share one, and [unintelligible] forward, it looks like you\u2019ll be significantly north of 9.5 obviously before year-end, as long as the long end of the curve doesn\u2019t move up too much.  So the question is, how do you think about using some of that capital?  And a two-part question.  One, would you have any interest in buying portfolios?  I know you can\u2019t buy depositories, but maybe assets?  And put some of the capital to work that way?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">A couple of things.  One is from a capital perspective you\u2019re right, we\u2019ll continue to build capital as we go through the year.  As I said in my operating remarks<strong>, </strong>I think that we should probably finish the year on a Basel III basis somewhere probably north of 10%.  I think we\u2019ll continue to look opportunistically at things out there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So I think the Best Buy transaction was an example from a portfolio that we saw, and we thought it made sense from a business fit, from a credit profile, from a synergistic perspective with other parts of our business.  We\u2019ll continue to look for those situations as they present themselves, but nothing really too overt in terms of being aggressively on an asset purchase perspective.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And if something did come up, and you had to choose between doing something that made sense for you from an acquisition perspective versus hitting the 10% plus at year-end, does the 10% matter?  Is that the primary goal?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I think the 10% does matter.  What we know is we know that the 9.5% is a real number.  What we don\u2019t know today is we don\u2019t know what the right buffer is, because we don\u2019t know what it means to be above or below the 9.5%.  So I think we would certainly look at any opportunities with a balanced eye towards those things we think make sense for the intermediate and longer term versus the shorter term capital tradeoff.  Tough to say.  We\u2019d have to look at the situation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And then just lastly, would you have any interest in going back and asking the regulators for an additional buyback request over and above what you were granted in March this year, in this calendar year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">This calendar year?  No.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question will come from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">First, a couple of specific questions, then one broader question.  What is your tier one Basel III common target?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Two things.  One is we\u2019ve said that we expect to end the year above 10%, and I think what Mike just said is we think 10% is a reasonable figure to think about right now, just as we\u2019re trying to assess what is the appropriate level of buffer to have or maybe not have above 9.5%.  But right now we\u2019re thinking in terms of 10% overall.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Does that expectation include the 30 to 40 basis points from the sale of the rest of the joint venture?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">No, in order to finish the year, Mike\u2019s numbers, as far as being above 10%, that doesn\u2019t require Morgan Stanley to call the entire 35%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So that would be a bonus on top of the 10%, if it happens.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yeah, let me just be very clear.  We do expect Morgan Stanley to at least call the 15%, which is due this year.  We\u2019re not counting on them calling the additional 20%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Separately, you mentioned repatriation.  Is that part of your tax planning strategy, so that you can use more of the DTA?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">No, repatriation of the earnings that we\u2019re applying the taxes on doesn\u2019t really involve the DTA.  By providing the taxes, we\u2019re driving down the DTA.  If we were to dividend those earnings, that could provide a little bit of a benefit, perhaps, in the actual utilization against the foreign tax credits.  But that\u2019s not something that we\u2019re actively planning on right now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And then lastly, a question for Mike.  This is the first conference call since the March 5 announcement about the longer term positioning.  And on the March 5 call, you said we\u2019ve got to prove the value of our model.  And I was wondering how you would see evidence of that proof.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Well, I think if you look at all the operating aspects of our model in this quarter, markets and banking, CTS, consumer, I think all had reasonable to better than reasonable quarters.  I think if you look at both from an absolute perspective, and importantly from a relative perspective, on the banking side of things we can continue to grow market share, which is an important approach to how we look at the increasing value of our franchise.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And I think importantly, what we\u2019ve done is, John showed in one of the slides sequential growth that we\u2019ve actually shown in our markets and banking businesses, as well as our consumer businesses over a reasonably extended time period.  And so I think the business has performed well, and I think we\u2019ve shown this quarter a good sample of when the franchise performs right, what value it can drive.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">As a follow up, I agree, the numbers beat consensus.  The stock\u2019s up 3%.  But the stock\u2019s still down 90% pre-crisis.  The ROE, with all the encouraging signs, is still only 8% versus 20% before the crisis.  So when we look back, say in two or three years, what would be the larger evidence that proves the value of the model?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I think you\u2019ve got to really separate a couple of things in there.  One is the numbers that you\u2019re citing, and appropriately so, are inclusive of the drag of Citi Holdings.  And so again, one of the things that we\u2019re focused on is reducing assets, reducing that drag, and as we go forward we will hopefully see some of those things get behind us.  I think as Betsy said, we did hit some fairly robust efficiency ratios out of parts of our markets businesses in other places, and so we\u2019d like to take what is happening in one quarter and continue to build on that and create more sustainability around it.  So I think those would be good milestones of progress.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And we\u2019ve laid those things out as far as the targets that we\u2019ve got on the table for 2015, both from an efficiency goal point of view in Citicorp and then ROA and ROTCE targets for Citigroup.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So is it fair to say those three targets will ultimately be the proof of the value of the model?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">At least the value of the model up through 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question will come from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">A couple of questions to clarify what\u2019s been talked about so far.  Just on the repatriation of foreign earnings into the U.S., I know you talked about the DTA impact of that a little bit, but I just wasn\u2019t totally clear.  If that were to happen, that does lower DTA, correct?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">By providing the tax, the U.S. tax, we\u2019ve already lowered the DTA.  Let\u2019s just work through an example.  If I\u2019ve got earnings in a legal entity that has a 12.5% tax rate, like in Ireland, and I have no intention of repatriating those earnings, they\u2019re going to be permanently reinvested outside, the only tax expense that would hit the P&amp;L would be the 12.5% local tax.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Now what we\u2019re saying is current and future earnings out of that legal entity could be repatriated.  They could be dividended back into the States at some point in time, which means now that you would need to provide the differential between the 35% statutory U.S. rate and the 12.5% local rate.  So that 22.5% incremental tax that we\u2019re providing is both an income tax expense that is impacting the P&amp;L.  You see it reflected in our effective tax rate.  And because it\u2019s a U.S. tax provision, it serves to reduce the DTA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay, so it\u2019s helping you right now whether or not you actually repatriate the earnings?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">That\u2019s correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And just another follow up question.  In the beginning comments, you laid out the three targets for 2015 and then said you won\u2019t reach these on a full year basis.  Did you mean full year in 2013?  Or full year 2015?  What was that comment?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Those are targets that Mike set out a month ago for the performance of the franchise for the year 2015.  Those are our targets.  We want to get Citicorp efficiency ratio at 55% or better.  We want to drive for Citigroup a return on tangible common of 10% or better.  And a return on average assets for Citigroup between 90 and 110 basis points.  Those are the targets that we are still working towards.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And then separately, it\u2019s hard to put you on the spot here a little bit, but we\u2019ve had a very big move in certain commodities the last couple of days.  And I know you guys have significantly reduced that business broadly speaking within your [fic] areas a couple of years ago.  But are you sensitive to big price swings in some of these commodity prices out there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Not really.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question will come from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">A couple of questions on the decline in delinquency in North America mortgage within NCL.  I think you guys said that a billion dollars was in sales.  Was the rest primarily in charge offs?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Let\u2019s just go over the numbers. We did about $2.8 billion of sales in the quarter.  About a $1 billion of those were for delinquent loans.  And the other $1.8 would be current loans.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">The delinquent loans are down 40 basis points in the linked quarter.  So that\u2019s $1.4-ish, right?  So a billion bucks was in sales.  So was the rest chargeoffs?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Some of it was chargeoffs, some of it was just an improvement in delinquency trends.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">How did that break down?  Was it primarily chargeoffs?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I don\u2019t have that.  I\u2019m sorry.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And then<strong> </strong>in the sales of the loans at this point, what kind of discount is necessary to sell those loans at this point?  And how would that flow through the P&amp;L?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Well, actually on some of the sales that we\u2019ve done, we did it at book value or above.  So those don\u2019t really have a loss associated with them.  In general, I would say it\u2019s going to be different for every tranche of sale that you do, because every tranche is a different point in the delinquency spectrum.  And so depending upon the quality of the loan, where it\u2019s delinquent, is it a modified loan, you\u2019re going to get a different discount rate.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">We did see an improvement in pricing this quarter, though.  I\u2019d say that basically across the entire spectrum of mortgage loan sales that we looked at, I would say that pricing improved somewhere between 5% and 10% percentage points higher this quarter compared to similar activity that we would have been looking at in the fourth quarter.  <strong> </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And I think you mentioned that you\u2019ve got $3 billion in other that is basically loans that are available for sale that you\u2019re in the process of selling.  Is that similar to the $2.8? A mix of delinquent and current mortgage?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Some of that $3 billion is the $2.8.  In other words, when we enter into a contract to sell loans, let\u2019s say mortgage loans, we would take those loans then out of the mortgage portfolio and move them in the held for sale.  It\u2019s not available for sale.  It\u2019s held for sale.  So these are transactions where we\u2019ve got a signed contract, we just haven\u2019t closed as yet.  So some portion of the $2.8 billion of mortgage sales that I referenced in the period, some of that is in the held for sale account and will be cleared out by the end of this month.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And for these sales, the delinquent mort, does that have a lot to do with, I think on a Basel III basis, RWAs within holdings dropped somewhere around $6 billion.  Was a lot of that driven by these sales?  Or were there other factors going on?  Could you kind of lay that out too?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">When we look at doing a sale of any asset in holdings, I think Mike has talked about this, especially when it\u2019s a delinquent mortgage, you look at it as far as what\u2019s the level of expected future credit losses that we expect on that mortgage, what\u2019s the cost of servicing that mortgage, and clearly a component of it would be what are the capital costs associated with continuing to hold that mortgage.  So we look at all of those various aspect of it.  I think if you looked as far as the drop in the Basel III assets for this quarter, it\u2019s probably a little bit heavily weighted towards the SAP portfolio again as opposed to the LCL portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">The pending sale of the Turkish operations, is there anything that we can think about as far as expectation for operating expense declines on the back of that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I think what we said in the press release is this is not a material transaction.  You\u2019ll see some drop off in revenue, you\u2019ll see some drop off in expenses, but it\u2019s not material.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question will come from the line of Jeffery Harte with Sandler O\u2019Neill.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Jeffery Harte - Sandler O\u2019Neill  </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">It may be a bit nitpicky, but looking at the international consumer loan growth, 4% year over year is quite a bit lower than we have been seeing.  Sometimes north of 7%.  Can you talk a little bit about what appears to be a declining growth rate in the international consumer loan business?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I think you\u2019ve got two different drivers.  What you may want to do is in the investor deck, if you go back to one of the pages that we have in the appendix, slide 29, and we actually break out the various drivers in constant dollars, split by region.  And I think what you\u2019re going to see is a little bit of a different story, depending upon the region.  If you look at it, we\u2019re still getting, I think, reasonable growth in Latin America.  L</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Latin America, it slowed down a little bit in the first quarter, as primary the Mexican economy slowed down a little bit.  But you still, on a sequential basis, and you take a look at the average loans, we\u2019re still growing card loans.  And there\u2019s some seasonality.  Normally you\u2019re going to have a little bit of a lower first quarter anyway.  So we\u2019re still getting growth in Latin America out of cards and the retail banking loans.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">The issue for us remains Asian.  And if you stay on that same slide 29, and take a look at Asia, on an average card basis, it\u2019s flat.  And quite frankly, you\u2019d go back to the first quarter of 2012 and we have flat average loans.  You\u2019re looking at 19.7, 19.8, 19.7, 19.8.  And then you take a look at the retail bank average loans, and again, they\u2019re flat.  So we\u2019re getting growth in some of the countries in Asia.  We\u2019re getting decent growth in Hong Kong, in Singapore.  The issue, and I hate to keep bringing it up, Korea is a drag on us right now.  And it\u2019s one that we just have to work our way through.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Jeffery Harte - Sandler O\u2019Neill  </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Tough to quantify, I know, but looking at securities and banking, a good quarter, maybe some of the trading not up year over year.  We\u2019ve kind of been conditioned recently to see a big drop off in activity levels in the second quarter.  As we see other things like better pricing in the North American mortgage loan portfolio when you\u2019re selling, can you give any color or insight into what you\u2019re seeing as far as risk appetites by investing clients out there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I think clearly a lot of the stance of the central banks out there, and the availability of credit, I think we, through the first quarter, continued to see risk [gone].  I think if you look at the underlying dynamics of the business, you know first quarter 2012 was a terrific quarter in terms of G10 rates in currencies.  This first quarter\u2019s strong performance in terms of our securitization revenues, in particular in North America, I think as well as pretty good contributions out of our local markets in FX businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So I think a good mix there, but I think as you see in the securitization markets, and some of the robustness there, and I think if you look at the calendar, clearly there\u2019s an appetite for people and their willingness to put on credit risk here.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So we saw that through the first quarter, but as I said, the world, I think, remains a challenging place, and you can just see, in some near term moves, when you get a Cypress, or you get certain things, investors do have the tendency to pull back pretty quickly from the markets when those situations arrive.  So I think we\u2019re going to have to watch that carefully.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Jeffery Harte - Sandler O\u2019Neill  </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And finally, the North American mortgage portfolio.  The delinquencies got a lot better sequentially.  Could you give us any kind of thinking on what might be a more normalized level of losses in that portfolio?  I\u2019m trying to just get maybe a feel for how much better you think things can theoretically get, credit wise, in that portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I\u2019m not going to be able to give any forward guidance as to where we think a normalized rate is in the holdings mortgage portfolio.  We do see, as you can see, the credit performance is improving.  And if you go back to one of the slides that we\u2019ve got in there, slide 17, you can see that we\u2019ve seen credit losses continue to decline in that portfolio.  And we would expect to see declining losses into the future, but I can\u2019t give you a \u201cnormalized\u201d rate on this particular portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question will come from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse  </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Not to beat the North America mortgage to death, but can you tell us how much of the portfolio you think would be saleable at or above book value?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">No, I can\u2019t.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">You had previously talked about the average life of the portfolio.  I\u2019m assuming with the sales and such that the average life is declining.  Is that fair?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I have to tell you, I haven\u2019t even tested the guys on what they now think the average life is.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I guess the reason I\u2019m asking is as the number of months of coverage goes up, if the average life is coming down, it seems like the two of those are going both in the right direction, and one should be eating into the other pretty aggressively at this point.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">If the average life is coming down, I would agree with you.  I just don\u2019t know that right now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And you kind of addressed a couple of questions ago about the growth in consumer loans in Asia a little bit.  Anything else in terms of programs or things that you\u2019ve got to kind of show better results in parts of that?  Are there any things we can kind of talk about?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">When you talk about programs\u2026</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I mean, are there parts of the portfolio that you\u2019re seeing any kind of better results?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yeah.  I would say in a lot of Asia, and I think I called out before Singapore and Hong Kong, we are seeing good, sustained growth, you know, in the 8-10% range, for revenues.  And you can see growth in some of the key drivers there as well.  But there\u2019s just a lot of different countries.  I mentioned Korea before.  But it\u2019s not just Korea.  There\u2019s deleveraging, there are regulatory constraints being put on in several countries throughout Asia.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And so we\u2019re facing some headwinds in Australia, in Taiwan, and in Korea as well.  One item that I think will help us later in this year, we can begin card sales again in Indonesia beginning next month.  And so that\u2019s a market that we\u2019ve been limited in for the last two years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question will come from the line of Fred Cannon with KBW.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Fred Cannon - KBW</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I just wanted to kind of refocus a little bit on the North American mortgage operations of Citicorp.  I know you did ramp up the originations quite a bit over the last year, around $18 but in the latest quarter.  However, at the same time, the servicing portfolio continues to decline, and I don\u2019t see any additions to the size of the mortgage portfolio in Citicorp.  And I was wondering if you could give us a little bit of color on what you see there, and are you planning to try to increase your market share Citicorp and mortgage?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Mortgage for us is not a big business.  We\u2019re very focused on executing on the mortgages for our retail banking customers.  So as we\u2019ve looked at a lot of the mortgage origination so far, it\u2019s really been more heavily weighted towards our branch business than anything else.  But as you\u2019ve seen, the rate loss volume that we put through in the first quarter, it actually is down slightly year over year, and it was up a bit from the fourth quarter.  But the mix is very heavily weighted towards our branch operations.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Fred Cannon - KBW </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay, so there\u2019s no kind of reemphasis to try to earn more money in that sector?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">No, we\u2019re not looking to significantly grow share in mortgages, other than with our existing retail banking base.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Fred Cannon - KBW </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And then just quickly, I was wondering if there was any impact in the quarter from the appreciation of the Japanese yen.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">There certainly is, but from an overall point of view, if you take a look at both the impact of the yen, the peso strengthening, overall, the FX impact on our EBIT is zero.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Two questions on your Latin American business.  First is on page 10, where you show the 90 days past due.  And they seem to be coming down steadily, but the chargeoff level is staying high.  So I\u2019m curious what is the dynamic?  Is there something unusual going on there?  And then the second question is on Friday there was a Dow Jones news story that you were looking to sell the Brazilian credit card business.  I wonder if you could comment on that.  Is that business part of Citicorp?  Or Holdings?  And I would have thought Brazilian credit cards would be pretty core.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">It\u2019s a lot of questions.  Brazilian cards is part of Citicorp.  We don\u2019t comment on newspaper musings.  Regarding the delinquencies in the NCLs, in Latin America, we have had a bit of an increase in the NCLs, and that\u2019s primarily been due to the seasoning that we\u2019ve had in certain credit card portfolios in Mexico.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And so we understand that the NCLs are a bit elevated right now, and that\u2019s why they\u2019ve kind of grown to that 4.6% that is on one of those slides.  But we do believe that by the second half of the year, the overall NCL rate in Latin America should normalize at around 4.5%.  So we don\u2019t see that as being a continuing upward trend.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And I think if you look at some of those statistics, when we gave you the 90-plus days past due, you can see the fact that in Latin America, the 90-plus has either been kind of flat from a cards point of view, or it\u2019s actually been improving in the retail banking business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">That was my question.  The delinquencies were down and the chargeoffs were flat.  It\u2019s not a pattern you normally see.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Yeah, it\u2019s just a seasoning of some large credit card portfolios in Mexico.  But that should all settle out by the second half of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Your next question will come from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Just to focus on Korea, is there anything in the recent activity going on in Korea that has you more worried about the potential for \u201cfixing\u201d Korea in the timeframe you\u2019ve been talking about over the last six to nine months?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">No, not really.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And then it does sound a little bit as if you are a bit more hopeful of the possibility of selling assets out of holdings, but at this point, it\u2019s still a little uncertain as to the potential investor or buyer demand.  Did I hear that correctly?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And then I guess just quickly in terms of the mortgage market, can you give us any indication in terms of you mentioned a little bit about the focus on that business relative to the branch population.  Do you have any metrics you can provide us in terms of what percentage of that population you\u2019re currently serving in terms of mortgages and where you\u2019d like to get?  And as mortgages decline, how should we think about the operating costs in that business coming down?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I can\u2019t give you any statistics.  I don\u2019t have anything with me that would point towards potential penetration of the retail banking client base for mortgages.  I\u2019m sorry.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Your next question will come from the line of Erika Penala with Bank of America.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Erika Penala - Bank of America Merrill Lynch </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I just had one on capital return.  Clearly with the very positive stress test result behind you, and you mentioning that your Basel III tier one common will likely be above 10% at the end of the year, how should we think about the midterm progression of capital return?  Should we assume a more gradual increase in your payout ratios?  Or is there a possibility of a larger stair step next year given your excess capital positioning?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I think right now it\u2019s early to call that.  Clearly one of the things that is important in this is not just the quantity, but the quality of earnings.  And I think as we go through the year, and that makes itself more transparent, that will probably dictate how we think about that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Your next question will come from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Mike, you mentioned the things that slowed down a little bit with Cypress, or had an impact.  How have the first two weeks of this quarter been, given Cypress, etc., from a trading standpoint?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I would say certainly slower than the very fast start to the year.  Volumes are decent.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Because the slowdown started in March.  So from March have we seen things improve a little bit?  Or still steadyish to where it was in March.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">It\u2019s a little hard to go week to week.  We had a reasonably good quarter in the first quarter.  I don\u2019t think that April looks like January.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">John, I have a question for you, just to follow up on the Latin America question that came up earlier.  Early delinquencies in Latin America seem to be up pretty sharply.  In retail loans they were up 20% linked quarter.  How does that square with your outlook for losses coming down back to 4.5% given the sharp jump?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Beautiful question, Vivek.  If you take a look at that page 15 in the supplement, where you see those increases?  Go back to the third quarter, and you\u2019re going to see a similar increase in the third quarter.  There is a mortgage book of business in Mexico that we actually operate through payroll accounts.  But they\u2019re on a 60-day payment schedule.  So we get a payment every other month.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">So you\u2019re going to see some variability in the delinquencies as you move from the first quarter, where we get a payment in February, to the second quarter, where we get payments then in April and June.  And so by the end of June, the delinquencies are back to where you would normally expect them to be.  They\u2019ll rise again in September, and they\u2019ll decline again in December.  So it all has to do with that one mortgage portfolio in Mexico.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I have one last question for you, John, which is the comp to revenue ratio in the first quarter of \u201913.  Can you give me a sense of what that was and what your full year target is for 2013?  Either you or Mike on that full year target that one of the?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">No, we don\u2019t comment on comp ratios.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy - RBC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">A couple of questions.  First, on the legal costs, I know they\u2019re legacy legal costs, and they\u2019re very lumpy and hard to predict.  Can you guys tell us, is there a statute of limitations?  Has it run out on all those legacy problems?  Or is there still potential for new litigation that could add to those lumpy legal costs?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">The one thing that you have to assume is that the legal community is very creative, and so I would say that there always is the opportunity for additional litigation, even in matters that you might otherwise think would have passed the statute of limitations.  I don\u2019t think lawyers have statute of limitations.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy - RBC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">My other question was your cost of funding obviously improved this quarter, and when you look at your deposits, and recognizing you have more of a global footprint than the two big banks that reported on Friday.  But even still, their cost of funding for their deposits is about a third of yours.  Do you think we could see yours fall meaningfully over the next 12 to 18 months, as the outlook improves for Citigroup?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Are you talking about deposits specifically?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy - RBC </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Yes.  You\u2019re at 73 basis points, and they average about 25.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Well, don\u2019t forget, a lot of what you\u2019re probably looking at from a peer institution, they would be operating in the U.S. and in the U.S. environment.  We have a much more global deposit base.  And so even though we\u2019re dealing with a rather low interest rate environment around the world, a low interest rate environment in the U.S. is going to be different than a low interest rate environment in, say, Mexico.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy - RBC </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Moving on to credit, I noticed in the nonperforming asset page, or your nonaccrual page, there was an uptick in the corporate nonaccrual loans in Citigroup.  What was that due to?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">A couple of hundred million dollars or something like that?  You\u2019re always going to have a little bit of an episodic increase or an episodic decrease.  There\u2019s nothing really there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy - RBC </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And then finally, you mentioned about Asia and the impact that Korea is having on that business.  What percentage is Korea as a percentage of the loan balances in your Asia portfolio?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Well, I can\u2019t give you the exact percentage, but you\u2019ll get a glimpse of that.  We\u2019ve got a page in the back of the book, I think it\u2019s page 32, that will actually give you the amount of loans that we have in key countries.  And so in the consumer loans, Korea comprises about $24 billion of our consumer loan book.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Your next question will come from the line of Andrew Marquardt with Evercore Partners</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I had a question on expenses.  It was helpful in terms of talking about positive operating leverage expected this year for Latin America, Asia, in consumer and [GTS].  How should we think about North America consumer?  What do we need to see happen before we get to see positive operating leverage there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I\u2019d say we\u2019ve got to get more revenue production out of the U.S. card businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And any idea in terms of the timing or higher rates required as well?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I think it\u2019s a business that we\u2019re in the process of repositioning.  I think that you take a look at the U.S. consumer, there\u2019s a decent amount of deleveraging still underway.  I certainly don\u2019t see any releveraging necessarily on the part of the U.S. consumer, other than refinancing mortgage loans and perhaps taking out more student lending.  Maybe auto loans a little bit.  We\u2019re not really in that business.  But from our point of view, getting more growth in the revolving balances, that\u2019s going to be a challenge over the course of the next couple of quarters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And in terms of the expense savings that you\u2019ve previously laid out, and you were targeting 900 for this year.  How much of that, if any, has been realized in the first quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">There\u2019s just a very small amount of that that\u2019s actually been realized in the first quarter.  A lot of the people that have been notified to date, they exit beginning in March, and there\u2019s a 60-day notice period.  And so those are savings that will accrue more towards the latter half of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And then in terms of just the backdrop, as Mike had laid out early on, in terms of things still challenging and perhaps a little bit tougher, are there more levers to pull beyond the [one one] savings that you\u2019ve already laid out, if indeed things are worse?  How should we think about that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">We\u2019re focused on really trying to manage expenses in terms of BAU, and trying to get more efficiencies into the business.  We recently announced that we\u2019ve brought somebody in externally to help us do that.  The businesses are going to be focused on that.  So we\u2019re mindful of the environment, clearly with an eye towards the expense side of things, but today we\u2019re not going to talk about any big levers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">And then a couple of [ticky tack] questions.  In the corporate other line, sequentially, in your slide deck, page 13, you had mentioned how linked quarter, revenue improvement was less negative this quarter versus last.  I guess partly driven by hedging activities.  What was that?  And how should we think about that going forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Hedging activities is something that\u2019s very difficult to predict.  I think you\u2019ll see that we end up with some fluctuation in that line all the time, and this is where we have some macro hedges against elements of the business.  But it\u2019s very difficult to predict.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Is that positive meaningfully this quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">I don\u2019t have a huge positive feeling in my head about it.  I just don\u2019t have the information in front of me.  I\u2019m sorry.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">And then the last is just on liquidity continues to be pretty strong.  Do you have your actual LCR ratio handy?  I think last quarter maybe it was around 118?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Yeah, I think we actually ended last quarter at 122.  I think we estimated it at 118 at the point in time we did the call, and then when the calculation was finalized, it actually increased.  And we\u2019re in the process still of doing those calculations, so I don\u2019t have a<strong> </strong>comparable figure in front of me at this point in time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">And do you have a target for that?  Will that drift lower as you deploy excess liquidity?  Since you\u2019re already well above the required.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">What we\u2019ve said is that certainly from where it was, when it was above 122, we said that it could drift somewhat lower.  But again, this is another one of these ratios where the minimum requirement is 100%.  And so we need to maintain some buffer above that 100%, just in order to be sure that you\u2019re not going to pierce it at some point in time.  We haven\u2019t formalized exactly where we want to set that buffer.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">There are no further questions at this time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Susan Kendall</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Thank you all for joining us today.

Today\u2019s call will be hosted by Susan Kendall, head of Citi Investor Relations.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Ms. Kendall, you may begin.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Susan Kendall</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Mike Corbat, will speak first. Then John Gerspach, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we\u2019ll be happy to take questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results in capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2012 Form 10-K.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you, Susan, and good morning everyone. Earlier today, we reported earnings of $4.2 billion for the second quarter of 2013. Excluding CVA and DVA net income was $3.9 billion or $1.25 per share.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Overall, we had strong, high-quality earnings, which were well-balanced across our products and geographies. As you know, generating such results consistently is one of my top priorities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Although volatility did increase in June, we had good performance across our securities and banking businesses during the quarter. Our transaction service business continues to be impacted by spread compression, as does our global consumer bank. However, we did grow our loans in our core businesses in a disciplined manner, particularly in the emerging markets, and we did so while maintaining a high-quality portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Our capital position strengthened, and our tier one common ratio increased to an estimated 10% on a Basel III basis, and we believe our firm is well-positioned for the regulatory requirements regarding capital and leverage ratios, although they\u2019ve not yet been finalized.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We continue to make progress in two critical areas: Reducing the drag on earnings caused by Citi Holdings, and the utilization of our deferred tax asset. We reduced our assets in City Holdings by $18 billion, and holdings assets now total just under $131 billion, and are less than 7% of our GAAP balance sheet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">This was the largest percentage reduction in assets since 2010, and it was driven not only by Morgan Stanley\u2019s purchase of the remaining 35% stake of the MSSB joint venture, but also by continued opportunistic sales, including over $3 billion of U.S. mortgages, bringing the total year to date to nearly $6 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">More significantly, the loss in holdings was reduced to less than $600 million for the quarter. In fact, holdings actually made a small profit when you exclude the impact of legal, rep, and warranty costs. Associated legal costs will likely remain elevated in the near term, but we took another significant step to get past legacy issues with our rep and warranty agreement with Fannie Mae.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Regarding DTA, we again consumed a modest amount during the second quarter; $600 million of DTA was utilized, bringing the total to $1.3 billion for the first half of the year. We also made good progress executing the repositioning plans we announced at the end of last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Among other actions, just after the end of the quarter, we closed the sale of our consumer businesses in Turkey and Romania, and reached an agreement to sell our consumer business in Uruguay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We\u2019re on track to realize about $900 million of expense savings this year, and $1.2 billion next year, due to these and our other repositioning actions. Looking to the second half of the year, it\u2019s unclear whether the market volatility that emerged in the second quarter will continue, and if so to what degree.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Low short term rates continue to be a headwind against our deposit taking and accrual businesses such as consumer banking and transaction services, and in the U.S., although the housing market is gaining strength, the lower volume of mortgage refinancing will impact our consumer business. We\u2019re already taking steps to make sure the mortgage business is sized correctly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">While still outpacing developed markets, emerging market growth slowed, but we remain very disciplined about to whom we\u2019ll offer credit in light of our targeted segments. As the Brazil credit card transaction indicates, we\u2019ve managed our risk profile carefully in every country we do business, and our target clients are stable, whether they be multinational corporates or high credit quality consumers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">John Gerspach will now go through the deck, and then we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. So with that, over to you, John.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Thanks, Mike, and good morning everyone. To start, I\u2019d like to highlight some significant items affecting our results this quarter. First, CVA and DVA were positive $477 million pretax, and $293 million after tax in the second quarter, for a positive impact on EPS of $0.09.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">For comparison purposes, in the second quarter of 2012, CVA and DVA were positive $219 million pretax, or $140 million after tax, for a positive impact of $0.05 per share. In addition, in the second quarter of 2012, we recorded a pretax loss of $424 million related to the sale of minority investments, which had a negative impact on EPS of $0.09 per share in that quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Adjusting for these items, we earned $3.9 billion in the second quarter of 2013, or $1.25 per share, as compared to $1 per share on an adjusted basis in the second quarter of 2012. Throughout today\u2019s earnings presentation, I will be discussing our results excluding CVA and DVA, and gains or losses on the sale of minority investments to provide comparability to prior periods.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In addition, as we show on slide four, there are a few other items which are included in our results. First, operating expenses in the second quarter included legal and related costs of over $800 million, compared to roughly $700 million last quarter, and nearly $500 million in the prior year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Legal and related costs at Citicorp were roughly $130 million in the second quarter, mostly in corporate other, while Citi Holdings legal expenses remained elevated, at roughly $700 million, primarily reflected in the special asset pool.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Legal and related costs will likely continue to be elevated and somewhat volatile as we continue to put our legacy issues behind us. Second, repositioning costs were $75 million in the second quarter, compared to $148 million in the first quarter of 2013, and $186 million in the second quarter of last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We expect to have some level of repositioning charges each quarter, but we are working to incorporate these actions into the daily management of our business. So, going forward, we would not expect to take large, episodic charges as we did in the fourth quarter of last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">And finally, the loan loss reserve release in the second quarter was $784 million, including a release of roughly $525 million related to the North America mortgage portfolio in Citi Holdings. The net reserve release was $650 million in the prior quarter, and $1 billion in the second quarter of last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On slide five, we show total Citigroup results for the quarter. Revenues of $20 billion grew 8% from last year, driven by securities and banking, while operating expenses of $12.1 billion increased 1%, reflecting the higher legal and related costs in Citi Holdings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Credit costs of $2 billion declined 25% year over year. Net credit losses of $2.6 billion were down 25%, and, as I noted earlier, the loan loss reserve release was also lower versus last year. We earned $3.9 billion of net income in the second quarter, or $1.25 per share, up from $1 per share last year on a comparable basis, driven by revenue growth and lower net credit losses, partially offset by higher legal and related expenses and a lower net loan loss reserve release.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Our effective tax rate was also higher in the second quarter, at 33% versus 20% last year, reflecting higher earnings in North America, a higher effective tax rate on international operations due to the previously disclosed change in our assertion surrounding the permanent reinvestment of earnings in certain international entities, and the resolution of certain tax issues in the second quarter. We expect our effective tax rate for the remainder of the year to be approximately 30%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Citigroup end of period loans declined 1% year over year, to $644 billion in the second quarter, as growth in Citicorp was more than offset by the wind down of Citi Holdings. And deposits grew 3% to $938 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to Citigroup expenses on slide six, in addition to the legal and related and the repositioning costs I discussed earlier, in the second quarter we recorded a $60 million charge for the estimated impact of the Fed\u2019s proposed supervisory assessment on large banks. This fee is expected to be retroactive to the beginning of 2012, so the $60 million charge represents the cumulative impact of six quarters of assessments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Excluding this fee, core operating expenses declined roughly 1% in constant dollars, both year over year and sequentially. Year over year, the expense decline reflects approximately $200 million of repositioning savings, partially offset by higher performance-based compensation expense.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">And, sequentially, the expense decline reflects approximately $100 million of incremental repositioning savings, as well as lower performance-based compensation expense compared to the first quarter, partially offset by higher marketing and transaction-related costs. We remain on track to achieve approximately $900 million of repositioning savings, full year 2013, with a run rate of approximately $1.2 billion beginning in 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On slide seven, we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Citicorp generated second quarter revenues of $18.9 billion, and net income of $4.5 billion. Year over year, revenues grew 7%, and expenses declined by 2%, driven by lower legal and related expenses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Credit costs in Citicorp increased modestly year over year, as the decline in net credit losses was more than offset by lower reserve releases. Citicorp loans increased by 4% year over year. Consumer loans grew 1%, as growth in international loans was mostly offset by a decline in North America. And corporate loans were up 7%, including the impact of adding approximately $7 billion of previously unconsolidated assets. Excluding this item, corporate loans would have increased 4% year over year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to Citi Holdings, revenues were $1.1 billion and the net loss was $579 million in the second quarter, an improvement from prior periods driven by a continued decline in credit costs. Citi Holdings ended the quarter with $131 billion of assets, down $60 billion, or 31%, year over year. At quarter end, Citi Holdings accounted for just under 7% of total Citigroup assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning now to Citicorp, our growth in the second quarter was broad-based across the region, as shown here on slide eight. In North America, revenues grew 7% year over year to $8.2 billion, driven mostly by improved securities and banking performance, while expenses and net credit losses declined, offset by a lower reserve release as credit continued to normalize.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In Asia, revenues grew 7% to $4 billion, mostly reflecting securities and banking, although we also grew consumer revenues while reducing expenses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In Latin America, our business is weighted more to consumer, which drove 8% growth in revenues to $3.5 billion. Expenses grew on higher volumes and credit costs were also up year over year, primarily reflecting portfolio growth and seasoning. However, we still grew earnings in the region.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">And in EMEA, our business is weighted more to the institutional franchise, which continued to perform well, driving 8% revenue growth to $3.1 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We generated solid revenue growth across each geography, with overall expense discipline and stable to improving credit quality, resulting in pretax earnings of over $1 billion in each region.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to slide nine, we show the composition of Citicorp revenues and pretax earnings by region, before the impact of loan loss reserves. These results also exclude corp other. For the first half of 2013, 43% of Citicorp\u2019s revenues, and nearly half of pretax earnings, were generated in the emerging markets. The higher relative profitability in the emerging markets reflects a lower cost base as well as the predominantly flow-driven nature of our institutional franchise in these markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Slide 10 shows the historical trend for Citicorp revenues on a trailing 12-month basis, with emerging markets contributing over two-thirds of Citicorp\u2019s total revenue growth over the past two years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In the last 12 months, Citicorp generated $32 billion of revenues in emerging markets. Over half of these revenues were generated in the consumer business, where we target a high-quality consumer segment largely based in the major cities. And, the remainder was institutional, predominantly serving our large, multinational clients as they fund their local operations, manage currency needs, and move payments around the world.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to slide 11, we show results for international consumer banking in constant dollars, including the impact of moving our credit card business in Brazil to discontinued operations in each period. On this basis, revenues grew 5% year over year, while expenses grew 1%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In Latin America, revenues grew 8%, and expenses were up 4% from last year. In Asia, revenues returned to growth, up 2% year over year, while expenses were down 2%. And, in EMEA, revenues grew 2%, with a 1% decline in expenses. While international consumer revenues continue to reflect spread compression in certain markets, as well as the impact of regulatory changes, particularly in Asia, most underlying drivers showed sustained momentum in the second quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Total average loans grew 5% from last year. Card purchase sales were up 9%, and investment sales grew 36% year over year. Both Latin America and Asia returned to positive operating leverage for the first half of 2013, and we expect to maintain this performance for the rest of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Credit costs of $751 million in the second quarter were up 19% from last year, on higher net credit losses due mostly to loan growth and portfolio seasoning. The loan loss reserve build was also higher this quarter, at $123 million, driven by portfolio growth as well as builds for specific credits and our commercial market businesses. Despite higher credit costs, positive operating leverage drove a 7% increase in earnings before tax to $1.2 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Slide 12 shows the results for North America consumer banking. Total revenues of $5.1 billion in the second quarter were down 1% year over year. Retail banking revenues of $1.6 billion declined by 4%, reflecting lower mortgage origination and servicing revenues, as well as continued spread compression, partially offset by a gain of roughly $180 million on the sale of an on-balance sheet mortgage portfolio. This sale of approximately $2.5 billion of conforming loans was opportunistic, given the favorable market environment earlier in the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Cards revenues of $3.5 billion were flat versus last year, as lower average loan balances were largely offset by an improvement in net interest spreads. On a sequential basis, net interest spreads were up slightly in Citi branded cards, while spreads were lower in retail services, driven by a higher percentage of deferred interest promotional balances.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Total operating expenses of $2.4 billion were down both year over year and sequentially, reflecting lower legal and related costs versus the prior year, and lower repositioning costs versus last quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Credit costs of roughly $850 million increased 19% year over year. Net credit losses declined by 21% to $1.2 billion, driven by an improvement in cards. However, the net loan loss reserve release was significantly lower at $351 million this quarter, compared to $814 million last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Overall, while we faced mortgage and spread related headwinds in North America this quarter that are likely to continue, we also saw some progress in our core franchise. Average deposits continued to grow, up 9% year over year, including 16% growth in checking account balances. Commercial market loans were up 17%. Card purchase sales grew year over year in both portfolios, and in branded cards, accounts also continued to grow, up 3% from last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Slide 13 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail. Credit quality in North America continued to improve in the second quarter, with declining net credit losses and delinquencies.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">And, in our international portfolios, we also saw stable to improving credit trends on a sequential basis. In Asia, the NCL improvement in the second quarter reflects higher recoveries, but even excluding this benefit, the rate would have remained under 1%, with 90-plus day delinquencies stable at under 50 basis points.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">In EMEA, we saw a net credit recovery in the second quarter while delinquencies continued to improve. And, in Latin America, the NCL rate improved to roughly 4%, while delinquencies were fairly stable. We currently expect the NCL rate in Latin America to remain in the range of 4% for the remainder of 2013.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">However, the rate could be higher if we incur any material losses on our exposures to home builders in Mexico, which are included in commercial market loans. Our loans outstanding to the top three builders totaled roughly $300 million at the end of the second quarter, with nearly 100% collateralized.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">While we currently believe that we are adequately reserved for any potential losses related to the home building industry in Mexico, we continue to monitor the performance of our clients as well as the value of our collateral.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Slide 14 shows our consumer loans by major country. Roughly 80% of our loans are in six markets: North America, which is roughly half of our portfolio, followed by Mexico, Korea, Australia, Singapore, and Hong Kong.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">While in certain markets, including North America, Korea, and Australia, loan growth has been hampered by the economic or regulatory environment, in other countries we continue to expand, reflecting the quality of our franchise and the growing population of high-quality borrowers in these markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Importantly, we are growing our loans with a disciplined focus on credit quality. In Mexico, while the NCL rate ticked up at the end of 2012, reflecting portfolio seasoning, the loss rate of under 4% remains low on a historical basis, driven by more stringent underwriting criteria and the repositioning of our cards portfolio over the past five years. And, in Singapore and Hong Kong, we have consistently maintained our focus on higher quality borrowers, resulting in low delinquency and loss rates.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Slide 15 shows our securities and banking business. Revenues of $6.4 billion grew 21% from last year, and declined 12% from the prior quarter. Investment banking revenues of $1 billion were up 21% from the prior year, with higher revenues in all major products, and declined 2% sequentially, driven by lower debt underwriting activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Overall, investment banking wallet share continued to improve in the first half of the year. Equity market revenues of $942 million were up 68% from last year, reflecting improved derivatives performance as well as higher cash equity volumes. Sequentially, equity market revenues increased 14%, driven by derivatives.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Fixed income market revenues of $3.4 billion increased 18% from last year, with strength across all major products, and were down 27% sequentially from a strong first quarter. Private bank revenues of $645 million grew 9% from last year, with growth across all regions, primarily driven by investment products, and were up 3% sequentially, driven by North America and EMEA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Lending revenues, excluding the impact of gains and losses on hedges related to accrual loans, were $401 million in the second quarter, down 3% from last year on lower volumes, partially offset by slightly higher spreads. Lending revenues were up 21% sequentially, due mostly to the absence of losses on loan sale activity in the first quarter, and slightly higher spreads.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Total operating expenses of $3.5 billion were down 2%, both year over year and sequentially, reflecting the impact of repositioning versus the prior year, and lower compensation versus last quarter. Earnings before tax of $3 billion grew 80% from last year, and declined 19% sequentially.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Moving to transaction services on slide 16, revenues of $2.7 billion were down 1% from last year. Treasury and trade solutions were down 3%, as loan and deposit growth was more than offset by the impact of spread compression globally, and securities and fund services revenues grew 5%, as higher settlement volumes and fees more than offset lower spreads.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Spread compression continued to dampen revenues this quarter. However, the volume drivers for transaction services showed sustained momentum. Average trade loans grew 16% year over year. Average deposits were up 7%. Assets under custody grew by 10%, and SFS settlement volumes grew 13%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Expenses of $1.4 billion grew 2% year over year, driven mainly by higher volumes, partially offset by efficiency savings. While spread compression is likely to impact revenues in the near term, we continue to believe we can achieve revenue growth and a return to positive operating leverage in the second half of 2013.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Slide 17 shows the results for corporate other. Revenues were down versus the prior year, driven by hedging activities, while expenses of $525 million declined as well on lower legal and related expenses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Assets of $290 billion included approximately $95 billion of cash and cash equivalents, and $141 billion of liquid available for sale securities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Slide 18 shows Citi Holdings assets. We ended the quarter with assets of $131 billion in Citi Holdings, or roughly 7% of total Citigroup assets. The $18 billion reduction in the second quarter reflected $8 billion of assets related to the sale of our remaining stake in the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney JV, $4 billion of other asset sales, and $6 billion of net paydowns.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On slide 19, we show Citi Holdings financial results for the quarter. Total revenues of $1.1 billion were up 17% year over year, as lower funding costs drove higher revenues in both the special asset pool and local consumer lending, despite the continued decline in loan balances. And we also saw improved asset marks in the special asset pool.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Citi Holdings expenses increased 25% year over year, to $1.5 billion, driven by higher legal and related costs in the special asset pool. Excluding these legal costs, core operating expenses declined 18% year over year, to roughly $845 million. Credit costs declined 63% year over year to $451 million. Net credit losses declined significantly to $770 million, and the net loan loss reserve release was over $470 million, including a release of roughly $525 million related to North America mortgages.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Looking at the past five quarters of Citi Holdings results on slide 20, rep and warranty reserve bills and legal and related costs continued to weigh on Citi Holdings in the second quarter. Excluding these items, Citi Holdings was breakeven on a pretax basis. The earnings improvement over the past two quarters has been driven by credit, as net credit losses continued to decline and we began utilizing our mortgage loan loss reserves.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">North America mortgage NCLs declined to $553 million in the second quarter, roughly 95% of which were charged to the reserve. We ended the quarter with $6.4 billion of loan loss reserves allocated to North America mortgage loans in Citi Holdings, or 35 months of coverage.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Going forward, assuming the U.S. economic environment remains favorable, we currently expect to continue to utilize reserves to offset nearly all of our mortgage net credit losses. Legal costs are expected to remain elevated in the near term.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">However, we put a significant piece of our rep and warranty issues behind us with the recent Fannie Mae agreement, which covers substantially all potential future repurchase claims from Fannie Mae on loan originations from 2000 through 2012. While we continue to work through our remaining rep and warranty issues, we believe we are currently well-reserved for potential whole loan claims.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">On slide 21, we show mortgage loan and adjusted net credit loss trends over the past two years. Since the second quarter of 2011, we have reduced the North America mortgage loans in Citi Holdings by 31%, driven by $17 billion of paydowns, $11 billion of asset sales, and $9 billion of net losses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">In the second quarter of 2013, we sold $3.1 billion of loans, including $700 million of delinquent mortgages and $2.4 billion of current reperforming loans. We have also significantly reduced the quarterly net credit losses on the portfolio, down 49% since the second quarter of 2011, to $553 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">On slide 22, we show delinquency trends, including both residential first mortgages and home equity loans. 30-plus day delinquencies improved by 10% sequentially to $5.5 billion, with improvement in each bucket across both portfolios.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">On slide 23, we show Citigroup\u2019s net interest revenue and margin trends, which, as a reminder, include the impact of moving our Credicard business to discontinued operations. Net interest revenue of $11.7 billion in the second quarter grew 3% year over year, and was up slightly from last quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">As we discussed at the end of the first quarter, our net interest margin in the second quarter decreased by 3 basis points, to 285 basis points. This decline was driven by lower loan and investment yields, partially offset by an improvement in funding costs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Looking to the second half of 2013, we expect our net interest margin to stay roughly flat to perhaps a few basis points lower than the second quarter, so on a full year basis, we expect to be slightly above the net interest margin of 282 basis points we achieved last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">On slide 24, we show our key capital metrics through the second quarter. Under Basel III, our estimated tier one common ratio increased to 10% versus 9.3% last quarter, driven by retained earnings, DTA utilization, and the sale of our remaining stake in the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney joint venture, partially offset by losses on available for sale securities in OCI.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Turning to the leverage ratio, Citigroup\u2019s supplementary leverage ratio, as calculated using the U.S. Basel III NPR, was an estimated 4.9% for the second quarter. Unlike the tier one common ratio, which is a period-end calculation, the supplementary leverage ratio is the average of the three month end ratios calculated in the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">While our average for the three months was 4.9% for the second quarter, this leverage ratio improved sequentially during the period, with an exit rate of just above 5% for the month of June. We are still reviewing the final U.S. Basel III rules, but do not believe the final rules will have a significant impact on the estimated ratios.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Our supplementary leverage ratio estimate does not incorporate differences in the definition of leveraged assets as recently proposed by the international Basel committee. As you are all aware, there has been quite a bit of activity and pronouncements relating to the capital requirements of large financial institutions over the past several weeks, and so our estimates are necessarily subject to our continued review and understanding of these recent developments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">In summary, our results for the second quarter reflected a continued challenging operating environment, with spread compression, slowing global growth, and elevated legal and related costs remaining as headwinds. However, even with these challenges, we continued to grow our core business while significantly reducing the earnings drag from Citi Holdings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">In securities and banking, we had a strong second quarter, even as market conditions became more volatile late in the quarter. In transaction services, we continued to grow loan and deposit volumes to mostly offset the impact of global spread compression. And, in consumer banking, we also grew our loans in many markets year over year, overcoming spread compression to generate revenue growth and positive operating leverage in every region outside North America.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">In North America consumer, the environment remains challenging, with a combination of spread compression, consumer deleveraging, and a slowdown in mortgage refinancing activity expected to continue to put pressure on revenues for the remainder of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">In the mortgage business, we are beginning to take actions to reduce our expense base with the decline in activity, but we would expect there to be some lag as we continue to fulfill our backlog through the third quarter. We may face additional pressure, if not only volumes but also margins decline further, as we look to the back half of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Turning to Citi Holdings, assets are now roughly 7% of total Citigroup, and the net loss was less than $600 million this quarter, even as we continued to face elevated legacy costs. While legal and related costs are expected to remain elevated in Citi Holdings in the near term, we put a significant piece of our rep and warranty issues behind us with the recently announced Fannie Mae agreement. And finally, our liquidity and capital positions remain strong, with estimated aggregate liquidity resources in excess of $380 billion and an estimated Basel III tier one common ratio of 10% at quarter end.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Finally, we remain on track to achieve the expense savings from our fourth quarter repositioning actions, even as some of our year over year savings were offset by higher performance related compensation, given our strong revenues in the first half of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And with that, Mike and I will be happy to take any questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p8\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">[Operator instructions.] Our first question will come from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">John, a question on expenses. I recall, in terms of the reposing savings, you were shooting for $900 million this year. In the first quarter you said you didn\u2019t get much of that. How much of that did you get in the second quarter? So where do we stand right now on realizing the $900 million you were shooting for this year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">You\u2019ve probably seen about $200 million of the repositioning savings reflected in the second quarter results.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And that $900, we should think of that as a year over year savings, \u201913 versus \u201912? Is that how we should look at it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I guess the way I would think of it is if you go back to the fourth quarter, when we first talked about the $900 million and the whole repositioning action, I think we had core operating expenses in that quarter of about $11.5 billion. Now, since then we\u2019ve taken out Credicard. We\u2019ve moved that to discontinued operations, and we certainly had some impact of FX.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And so if you adjust for those two items, that would probably adjust out 11.5, to just a little bit north of 11.3. So the fourth quarter repositioning actions we\u2019ve said, you know, would yield full year saves of $1.2 billion, which means that $300 million of that save should be visible in our fourth quarter numbers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So if you start with $11.3 billion in the fourth quarter of last year and you look at $300 million of saves that should be embedded in our fourth quarter numbers, you should expect a fourth quarter core operating expense number, you know, somewhere around $11 billion. Again, depending on how performance related IC could flow for the balance of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And that was around $11.2 billion? The $11.173 billion this quarter? That\u2019s the right comparable number?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yeah, for this quarter we\u2019re at $11.173 billion, and that includes the higher performance-related IC that we\u2019ve had this quarter. And I\u2019d say that we\u2019re on target to deliver the annual savings by the end of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And in terms of the legal expenses remaining high, $800 million this quarter, it seems like you\u2019re on track to be similar to last year, when you did about $2.8 billion for the total. It\u2019s hard to predict that. Any color you could give us on the outlook there? Or just what\u2019s driving that to remain high? Is this kind of private label litigation stuff? Or any color you could offer there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Certainly private label litigation is one of the legacy issues that we\u2019re dealing with. And you\u2019re quite right, we had $2.8 billion of legal and related expenses last year. We had $700 million or so in the first quarter of this year. So I would expect legal and related costs to, as we said, remain high and somewhat volatile.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And in terms of the DTA utilization, $1.3 billion for the first half, are we on a steady pace here? Can we think of $600 million to $700 million per quarter as a reasonably sustainable pace in this kind of environment? Or are there funny factors we need to think about that might drive this to be volatile over the next couple of quarters?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">It\u2019s actually going to depend upon the level and component pieces of our earnings stream. In looking at this quarter, Citicorp earnings actually utilized $1.3 billion of DTA. That would have been partially offset by $300 million of DTA that was created by holdings. Then you had CVA that actually utilized - because CVA was a revenue item this quarter - $200 million of DTA this quarter. And then OCI created DTA. So there\u2019s a lot of moving pieces that go into that $600 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">But the gradual trend of smaller drag in holdings is the key thing that will get this higher over time I guess?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I\u2019d say the two key things would be continued strong earnings out of Citicorp, and then the gradual decline, hopefully, in Citi Holdings losses, yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And then final thing from me, in terms of that new supplemental leverage ratio, any thoughts on where you would look in terms of the bank level that will ultimately need to be into the 6% standard?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">We did not have enough time to run the bank ratios for the second quarter. You know, as we mentioned, you\u2019ve got to run each month, and then the average of three months, and it\u2019s just a little bit more involved in running the bank. We had run the bank for the month of March, and at least as we ran the bank for the month of March, we were right around 6% for the month of March.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Just some question in terms of why we didn\u2019t see maybe more negative impact from the volatility in emerging markets, either within your capital or some of the fixed income businesses. I realize that\u2019s two different things, but just the volatility we saw in FX, and the spread widening, and [unintelligible] problems. It didn\u2019t really seem like it was all that material in the grand scheme of things.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">As a matter of fact, I think we managed our emerging markets business quite well in the quarter. In the fixed income numbers, one of our real strong performers was our local markets FX business. That business, if I recall, generated revenue growth of 25% year over year, and 7% sequentially. So we actually performed quite well this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And then just somewhat related on the fixed income trading. Any meaningful impact from the OTC clearing of the swaps? Or do you think we\u2019ll have one going forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We still have to see how everything settles out. I still haven\u2019t seen the final guidance and everything that\u2019s coming out of all the debates from last week. And I think that\u2019s still something that is yet to be developed.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And you gave some net interest margin guidance. What about for net interest income dollars overall? Do you think we\u2019ll see them trend up from here?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">That\u2019s a little bit difficult. If you look over the last couple of quarters, we\u2019ve been relatively stable in our daily net interest revenue. I think our daily net interest revenue this quarter was $130 million a day. Last quarter it was $131 million a day. So it\u2019s going to be somewhat dependent on day count and a few other things. I really wouldn\u2019t want to go out on a limb and start predicting big increases in net interest revenue at this point.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">A couple of questions on the capital ratios you indicated earlier. The bank sub level first half, 6% March, but the hold co, 4.9%. Can you just give us a sense as to what the big deltas are there? I just want to make sure the bank level six first pass is based on the proposed NPR not the final rule. Is that right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">You\u2019ve actually confused me with that question, Betsy. It\u2019s based upon the rules that we\u2019ve got outstanding right now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And what makes the bank in such better position relative to the hold co?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">It would be capital level and component of the balance sheet as far as how the leveraged assets are calculated.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay, I was just thinking about it from the perspective of where your derivatives business is held. A portion of it in the bank, but a portion of it in the hold co. So I\u2019m just wondering if that has a disproportionate impact on the bank or not.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Everything has an impact. All we do I just run the rules. Don\u2019t forget the bank also has intercompany relationships in it. That\u2019s why the bank is a little bit more complicated to think through.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yeah, I know you downstream some equity to the bank as well, and that helped, I would assume. Why just doing the ratios on the NPR as opposed to the final rule for the Basel ratio?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We\u2019re running them off of the U.S. final rule.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay, I\u2019m just thinking there\u2019s the slide two, you had the note that all references to Basel III capital ratios are based on the proposed Basel III, the Basel III NPR?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">It\u2019s based upon the final rule as we best understand it right now. We have not finished going through every detail of the 900-plus pages in the final rule. So as we have looked at the final rule, we don\u2019t believe that for us there is any significant difference between the final rule and the NPR, because we haven\u2019t been able to find anything as yet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yeah, I just wanted to understand why you put that footnote in there. So two other quick things. One is on the [$50-60] million that you called out, which is obviously a pretty small number, and not really that material, especially on a quarterly basis. So I\u2019m just wondering what it is exactly, the regulatory assessment that you called out.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Well, the Fed last quarter actually, I believe they\u2019re allowed to do this under Dodd-Frank\u2026 Dodd-Frank permits the Fed to assess large banks with a special assessment for higher cost of regulation. And so the Fed put out, last quarter, an assessment proposal on all banks. I think that the total assessment was $440 million, and when we ran through the calculations for us, it comes out to be roughly $10 million a quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Now, that was put out subject to a comment period, and all the comments are in, and we expect that the Fed will do something in the third quarter. And so we just thought it was prudent, then, to begin to accrue what we would estimate the impact of the fee to be. And since it\u2019s retroactive, all the way back to the beginning of 2012, for this quarter, then, we would have recorded six quarters of the estimated $10 million assessment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And then just lastly, on the litigation costs that you called out, you had, obviously, as you indicated, several settlements this quarter as well. So I\u2019m just wondering how much of the settlements were already reserved for, and how much of the litigation costs this quarter were to true up those settlements or how much is building reserve for future litigation?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I think you\u2019ll see more detail when we publish the Q. And clearly if any of those settlements had involved significant charges in the quarter, we would have called that out.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question will come from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So you referred to the Basel proposal for add ons to the leverage ratio denominator, and I guess you were talking about the sold credit protection and match book and derivatives collateral disallowed. I think that\u2019s probably what you were referring to. Do you have any estimate for what the increase in your denominator would be in dollar terms for those things?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Again, all of this stuff has just come out, and so we did a very, very preliminary look at what the impact would be. And we would currently, roughly estimate that the combination of all those things could cost us as much as 40 basis points in the supplementary leverage ratio, but again, it\u2019s early, and we still have to take a look at exactly what the details are, and what else we might be able to do to offset some of that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">On emerging markets, obviously what\u2019s happened over the last several months in some markets like China and Brazil would make you think that maybe we\u2019re looking at some weakness in macro growth. Any revisiting of the plans that you had talked about a few months ago to rationalize emerging markets investment in light of all that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">The simple answer to that is no. You saw us, as we laid out, take some actions in the first quarter in terms of continuing to refine, in particular, parts of our consumer portfolio. But again, I think as we looked at the world and I think described coming into the year, what we saw was going to be a challenging, uneven environment. We obviously saw the numbers come out of China early this morning in terms of a slight slowdown, in the 7.5 versus the 7.6, a bit slower in Mexico. But I don\u2019t think those things have caused us to rethink where we are.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">The AOCI hit was obviously reasonably meaningful, in light of a pretty bad increase in long rates. And yet it seems like, looking at your AFS portfolio, it could have been worse. Did you take actions to reduce the impact by repositioning risk or something, sort of midquarter, ahead of the potential for rates to rise? Or was there something else there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">It\u2019s just the way we manage the business on an ongoing basis. Nothing special.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And I guess the final question I\u2019ll ask is I think you alluded to trade finance growth, and looking at CTS, it looks like loans grew sequentially by about $13 billion, if I\u2019m reading this right. And that was about the same growth year over year as well as sequentially. So it basically all happened this quarter. Pretty sizable. Anything in particular going on in terms of market share initiatives or something that would have taken those loan balances up so fast?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">One of the things we tried to footnote for you, and maybe we didn\u2019t get it on every schedule, but I tried to mention it in some of my comments, is that this quarter we also consolidated a previously off balance sheet vehicle that added about $7 billion of trade loans. This was a conduit that we had that housed really high quality government guaranteed export trade loans.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And just looking at the vehicle and the spread that we were getting, we felt that we could actually more efficiently fund the loans by bringing them back onto our balance sheet. So that $7 billion also got added in this quarter, and that\u2019s certainly impacting the number that you see.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So all of that $7 billion went to CPS?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">One on the mortgage NCLs. They came down 12% sequentially in Citi Holdings, which is great, but if we look at your peers, they were down much more than that. Is this just a function of you being more conservative on price assumptions? How should we think about the pace of recovery and loss rates in mortgage?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I don\u2019t want to say we\u2019re more conservative in taking losses than anybody else. I think that what you\u2019re starting to see now is that as that legacy mortgage portfolio shrinks, and it\u2019s now down to $80 billion, what you have now is a bit more of an influence on the loss rates from the mortgage loans that we would have had as part of our Citi Finance business. And those mortgages carry a significantly higher loss rate than what the other mortgages would. And so I hate to use the word mix, but you\u2019re getting something of a mix impact on the NCL rate.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And you\u2019re suggesting those might be a little lag in terms of the recovery, because of the quality of them.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Those mortgages, they have an inherent larger loss rate. They didn\u2019t necessarily peak to the same extent, as high as some of the other aspects of the book, but they pretty much consistently run a loss rate of, say, 5%. So you\u2019ve got an element of our book that\u2019s running a 5% loss rate.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And that\u2019s also an element of our book that we\u2019re really not able to do much in the way of asset sales on. So those Citi Finance mortgages become an increasingly larger percentage of the overall $80 billion, and therefore they\u2019re going to be a somewhat mitigating factor as far as our ability to bring the overall loss rate for the portfolio down.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And then just maybe on the rate sensitivity, you guys, in your Q, talked about a steepening curve, maybe benefit of a little over $100 million, not very much. Versus your peers, that\u2019s on the low end. Is it a function of you being shorter in duration in your [AFS] book, and if you have that number that would be great, or is it just a factor of geographic mix on the balance sheet, that you\u2019re just less exposed to the U.S. rate curve?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I can\u2019t tell you how other people are positioned, but I think you\u2019re right, as focusing on that scenario [six] that we\u2019ve got in the 10-Q. But there\u2019s also a whole series of assumptions that go behind that analysis, including the assumption that in that type of environment, we would just match our investments and our funding book. In other words, the duration of the investment book would remain static. We wouldn\u2019t look to extend the duration of the book to capture yield, and I think you\u2019re right in assuming we are somewhat shorter duration, right now at least, than we would normally be.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Do you have that number? Or you don\u2019t disclose it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I\u2019m not going to give you the overall duration, but it is fairly short.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Thanks for the color on the emerging market book. I was just kind of curious if the trends that you saw in the 30-day delinquency rates were any different than the 90-day rates that you gave us?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">In the consumer book, where we\u2019ve given you the detail? We\u2019ve actually got a lot of that back in the supplement. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything terribly telling as far as the 30-day delinquency statistics. You get some noise in some of the statistics. I think we talked in past calls about how the 30- to 90-day bucket in Latin America tends to move from quarter to quarter because we\u2019ve got a mortgage portfolio in there that actually we collect payments on every 60 days.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So you would have seen 30- to 90-day delinquencies in Latin America consumer spike up in the first quarter, and how you\u2019ve seen them drop in the second quarter. But outside of some individual portfolio quirks, there\u2019s nothing in the credit statistics in the early bucket delinquencies that gives us any extraordinary cause for concern.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">You also said that you had seen the slowing growth in emerging markets, but the revenues have hung in there. So should we continue to expect that revenue and credit would track roughly similar to what you\u2019ve recently seen this quarter? If we continue to see the slowing growth play out in emerging markets?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">That\u2019s somewhat easier to talk about in the consumer businesses than it is in the institutional businesses. But on the consumer businesses, I think that\u2019s exactly the guidance that we were trying to provide you with in some of the closing commentary, where we feel that the consumer businesses in both Latin America and Asia should produce positive operating leverage in the second half of the year as we are able to grow revenues faster than growing expenses. On the institutional side, that\u2019s somewhat going to be dependent upon overall market conditions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And then in the equities business, another encouraging stat here this quarter. And I also noticed it seems as though, at least in the press, you guys recently hired someone out of PB. Is that a side of the business that you guys are looking to grow? What are your thoughts on the equities business at this point? Is it going to continue to be a focus to try to grow that further? Or are you guys happy with where it is now?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I think what you saw is when we, over the past several years, we\u2019ve been going at the expense side of that business, trying to get it really in line with what we saw as future revenue opportunities. What you\u2019ve seen us also do is, while we\u2019ve shrunk our overall headcount and expense base, we\u2019ve also selectively made investments in terms of people and trading platforms in that business, and so early times. The results are improving. We\u2019re focused on continuing to want to take market share. We\u2019ve seen that. We\u2019ve seen good sequential growth quarter over quarter, but we\u2019ve got more work to do.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">You guys highlighted the decline in funding costs in holdings. Should we assume that decline is sustainable? And maybe could you give a little further color on what drove that decline?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">As the assets roll off, we obviously have a slightly higher cost net associated with those holdings assets. And so as those holdings assets roll off, the debt levels will reduce, and that should serve, then, to provide a funding cost benefit to that business. But really is more in line with the assets continuing to come down.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy - RBC </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">You\u2019re doing quite well on your Basel tier one common ratio. It\u2019s 10% now. Where do you think you\u2019re going to manage to when you know all the ins and outs of what\u2019s required, which may take another 12 months. But what do you think you\u2019ll ultimately manage to on that ratio, as well as the new supplemental leverage ratio?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I think you\u2019ve touched on the challenges, but I don\u2019t think we know yet all the ins and outs, and as we\u2019ve spoken about in the past, we don\u2019t really know yet around the rules what really buffer in either metric we need to run the institution to. So one of our objectives we\u2019ve stated is to, within reason, try and get to at or around these leverage ratios within a reasonable time. And as these rules continue to clarify themselves, we\u2019ll continue to adjust to that. But again, I think there\u2019s a lot more work we\u2019ve got to do to see how these things finalize themselves and what that buffer is.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy - RBC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And I may have missed this. Did you give us the LCR ratio for this quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">No, I didn\u2019t, but would you care to ask about it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy - RBC </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Sure. Just tell me what it is, please.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I mentioned the fact that we had over $380 billion worth of high-quality liquid assets, and at least the early estimate of the LCR ratio says that it\u2019s coming in exactly where we targeted it at, which is, as we said last quarter, right around 110%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy - RBC </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Could you also share with us, you mentioned Mexico, the three largest builders. Are those still accruing loans? Or are any of them in default? And then just some color on what you\u2019re seeing down in Mexico right now?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I don\u2019t know the answer to your first question. So I\u2019m going to have to ask you to call Susan or somebody in IR and by the time that happens, they\u2019ll figure out the answer to your first question. They are 100% collateralized, those loans. Nearly 100% collateralized.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy - RBC </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And just color in general? Because Mexico has been so strong. And now this housing situation seems kind of odd considering the economy down there is pretty good.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I think what you have there is just market forces at work. Supply and demand, and as usual, with real estate, the most important consideration is location, location, location. And some of the home builders got a little over extended in putting supply where people don\u2019t necessarily want to live anymore.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy - RBC </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And then just finally, in Citi Holdings, the decline in the SAP assets to $14.9 billion from $18.5 billion, were there any bulk sales? Because you had some impressive declines in some of the categories.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I can\u2019t recall any large bulk sales off the top of my head. Again, it\u2019s just continuing to chip away at everything that is in holdings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy - RBC </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And has pricing for these assets improved, or does it continue to improve, from what you\u2019ve seen in the last six months?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I\u2019d say in general the pricing has held up. Obviously with mortgages now, given the change in the 10-year rate, that certainly has had an impact on the pricing that we see for reperforming loans. We mentioned the fact that we did about $3 billion of loan sales this quarter, and roughly $2.4 billion was reperforming loans. Those types of loan sales are more sensitive to changes in interest rates, because they\u2019re very yield-sensitive. And so that clearly is in a portion of the market that we\u2019ve seen prices decline in. In contrast, nonperforming mortgage loans seem to be more sensitive to changes in HPI. So pricing there has held up pretty well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">What\u2019s the capital markets backlog at the end of the quarter compared to the end of last quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I don\u2019t have that, Mike. Sorry.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">You made the comment that you expect to use reserves in Citi Holdings to offset nearly all of the mortgage losses. If you could elaborate on what that means. And does that mean, if I look at slide 20, the bottom right hand corner, where you have adjusted pretax earnings for Citi Holdings, that\u2019s zero this quarter. Does that statement that you\u2019ll use those reserves to offset mortgage losses imply that that adjusted pretax earnings figure of zero in the second quarter of 2013 should stay at zero or go higher? Or you aren\u2019t willing to make a statement that this is an inflection point?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I think it\u2019s a little early to make a prediction as far as an inflection point. And a statement as far as using the reserves, it\u2019s really nothing more than basically continuing to do what we\u2019ve done here in the second quarter, where we\u2019ve used reserves to cover basically 95% of the mortgage NCLs. Don\u2019t forget that the holdings portfolio is pretty much a closed book, right? It\u2019s not like we\u2019re adding new loans into that portfolio. And that\u2019s a little different than you would think about in a normal mortgage business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So we\u2019ve established reserves for what we believe to be the losses that are inherent in that portfolio, based upon the way that the markets are moving, and the way that we would look at our need for reserves right now. We felt this quarter, and we think that certainly in the next two quarters - you can look out about six months - we don\u2019t see any reason why we shouldn\u2019t be using the reserves that we\u2019ve already established to almost fully cover the losses that we set them up to cover.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">What about blowing out some more of the problem mortgages from Citi Holdings? You said that\u2019s more a function of home prices, so why not get more aggressive with sales?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Well, again, you\u2019ve got two different components to the book. From a nonperforming loan point of view, you\u2019re quite right. Those nonperforming loans are very price sensitive to HPI. And we were able to do about $700 million of nonperforming loan sales this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">But we\u2019ve been doing nonperforming loan sales, go back to the last 15 quarters. And so our nonperforming loan book is fairly well picked over at this point in time. And with delinquencies performing the way they are, we\u2019re not necessarily creating a bunch of new inventory, which we think is good.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">The other side of the book, as we continue to modify loans, and those loans then perform, that gives us a different set of inventory to deal with. And you\u2019ve noticed that, in the last two quarters, we\u2019ve actually taken advantage of that. We sold $2.4 billion of reperforming loans this quarter, and a similar number last quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">The trouble with reperforming loans is that the pricing on those loans is really yield sensitive. And so now with interest rates spiking the way they are, the pricing is not quite as favorable in that market at this point in time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And a completely separate question, going back to your March 5 presentation, slide 12, you had a couple of categories: optimize and grow, and optimize restructure. So I was wondering, with the benefit of a few more months to evaluate the franchise, if there\u2019s any incremental information on that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And then also as you said on the call, you expect to have your $1.2 billion run rate expense savings going into 2014. What\u2019s after that? So really, what\u2019s next for expenses and restructuring, and what else have you learned in the past few months?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Well, I think as we laid out in March, what we said is that those slides are going to continue to evolve, our four buckets. And so we have, as part of the restructuring, and as part of the things that we\u2019ve announced as normal course of business, in terms of refinements of our institutional clients and our consumer strategies, continued to work against that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I think importantly, as John spoke about from a repositioning charge perspective, we\u2019re not planning, signaling, talking about some big repositioning, but want to continue to push our businesses to work and optimize over time. And so I think what you\u2019ve seen in the first half of the year, and it is just the first half of the year, from an efficiency ratio perspective, we\u2019re making progress, and we\u2019re pushing our leaders and managers around the concept of thinking about and running their businesses that way.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So there\u2019s nothing that we\u2019ve got planned that\u2019s a big monumental move in terms of an overall restructuring or change of direction at the company, just a focus on being in a challenging operating environment, and making sure we\u2019re managing ourselves in the appropriate way.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And I think before you said the optimized restructure bucket might be about 10% of the firm, is that correct? And has that changed? And any more color on what that bucket might include?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I don\u2019t have that slide in front of me. That number actually sounds a bit low to me as you describe it, at that percentage. No, again, I think this work continues to evolve, and I would say at this point, nothing new to report. And as we get to year end or into the fourth quarter, and go through budgets, we\u2019ll be continuing to assess how we\u2019re thinking about our products and our countries, and we\u2019ll continue to align and realign those buckets accordingly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer &amp; Company.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">My first question is assuming the change in leverage ratio rules stays, does that impact any of your major significant businesses? I mean, do you have to run them differently? I\u2019m thinking custody and transaction processing, maybe government bond dealing. Anything that\u2019s heavy in leveraged assets, but not RWAs. Are there any businesses that you\u2019re going to have to run differently?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">All good questions, and all way too early in the process to really address. Certainly what we\u2019ve seen so far are proposals. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve actually had a chance to read through every aspect of it, and I would expect that as usual, we\u2019ll engage in a robust and healthy dialogue, constructive dialogue, with the various regulators on these topics.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And then secondly, just to follow up on the questions about emerging markets, a lot of the damage to the whole commodities complex, all that has happened very, very recently, in the second half of May and June. And just I was wondering if Mike\u2019s comments earlier, should we read that if commodity prices roughly stay at this level, that we should not expect any significant fallout in terms of your businesses in the emerging markets?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I think, again, as John described, there\u2019s two components to our business. One is the consumer piece, and we\u2019ve signaled how we think about the second half of the year there. I think it\u2019s difficult right now to be able to judge where we are in terms of a trading environment. June was certainly choppier than the first four or five months of the year. And it\u2019s hard to predict what the trading environment is going to be like in the second half.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I didn\u2019t mean so much the trading environment. I meant gold and all other commodities that you can look at, basically, have come down pretty significantly in May and June. And does that significantly impact the economies you\u2019re working in?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I think that\u2019s exactly what we have to see. It\u2019s not so much the commodity price in and of itself. It\u2019s what\u2019s the ongoing impact on the economies. And as we\u2019ve said before, we still anticipate that the emerging market economies are going to grow at a much faster rate than the developed economies. And so we would still expect to get more growth out of the emerging markets in general than the developed markets. And we continue to run our business in each of those geographies with a very disciplined focus on credit.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Your next question comes from the line of Erika Penala with Bank of America.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Erika Penala - Bank of America Merrill Lynch </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Just a quick follow up question. I appreciate the guidance on NCLs for [GCB] Latin America. Should we expect the same stability in dollar provision or should we continue to increase it as we\u2019ve seen over the past two quarters?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">That\u2019s a good question. I would say that when we say that the rates should stabilize, you would likely see some small increments in the NCL nominal dollars themselves. Again, subject to currency fluctuations.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Erika Penala - Bank of America Merrill Lynch </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">So the dollar NCLs are going up, but the dollar provision will go up in tune with growth and the dollar increase in NCLs?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">On a constant dollar basis, with growing portfolios and a stable NCL rate, you would expect the nominal dollar NCL to increase slightly, right along with the growth in the portfolios. As those portfolios grow, it\u2019s likely, then, that we would have to provide some level of additional loan loss reserve against those portfolios.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Erika Penala - Bank of America Merrill Lynch </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And just one more question, for a different topic. Mike, could you update us on what your thoughts are in terms of potentially doing large card transactions in the U.S., and what are the top parameters you\u2019re considering, whether thinking about even putting a bid in, or formulating a bid in, if a large card transaction were to become available?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">A couple of things we can speak about. One is you saw us in the first quarter announce our Best Buy transaction, roughly a $7 billion card portfolio that we thought fit in well against our retail partner services business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And so in that business, we would continue to look at portfolios that we think fit in and have adjacencies, either from a sector or from a geography perspective, in there. Obviously we\u2019re going to be mindful of returns of capital, of absolute risk profiles that are there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">So things that make sense from that perspective, we\u2019re happy to consider. And I think in the branded space, there\u2019s probably less opportunities to acquire portfolios in that segment of the market, in the areas where we are.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">But again, if those presented themselves, and economically they made sense, and they were the right client set that fit against our targeted set of clients, and they were the right risk profile, we\u2019d certainly consider them.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Your next question comes from the line of Fred Cannon with KBW.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Fred Cannon - KBW </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I just had a couple of follow up questions on the DTA. I was wondering about the reduction in the DTA in this quarter, if you were able to reduce the foreign tax credit carry-forward portion of the DTA as a result of that reduction.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Great question. Addressing the component pieces of the DTA as far as how much of it relates to foreign tax credit and everything else, that\u2019s something that you can really only answer as you close out the year and you finalize your overall tax provision. So trying to provide detailed guidance as far as how much of the $1.3 billion of DTA that we\u2019ve utilized in the first half of the year, how much of that comes off of [FPCs]. I just can\u2019t reliably do that at this point in time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Fred Cannon - KBW </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">That\u2019s why it\u2019s in the K, not the Q, I imagine. Also, in terms of the Best Buy card deal, any update on the timing of the closing of that? And also, is there any way we can estimate how much positive impact that would have on the DTA once it does close?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">It\u2019s a little hard to isolate a specific portfolio, but as far as I know, we\u2019re still on track to close that deal in September. So we won\u2019t get much benefit, if any, in the third quarter out of that portfolio, but it\u2019s a $7 billion portfolio then. We should get a fourth quarter benefit from it in the fourth quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Fred Cannon - KBW </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And then the tax rate taken against that. I know it\u2019s hard to isolate, but just from our standpoint, the tax rate taken against that should help directly reduce the DTA?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">All things being equal, yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">John, you mentioned transaction services, you expect operating leverage gains in the second half. Just specifically, is that expected in fourth quarter? Or are you suggesting that that could be the case for the full second half results within TS?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Just want to make sure, that was for transaction services. I wasn\u2019t being specific to a part of TTS. That was really expansive for all TTS. And I actually think that you might be able to see some positive operating leverage as early as the third quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And then you mentioned that there were still some regulatory headwinds in the Asian business. I guess you mentioned in the past some of the regulatory challenges that you\u2019ve faced in Korea. I guess I\u2019m curious, maybe to get a sense as to how far along on that path, specific to Korea, you think you are, since it sounds like you\u2019re expecting somewhat better operating leverage trends within the Asian business overall.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I would say that Korea is still going through some issues. I don\u2019t think that we\u2019re going to be completely out of the regulatory headwinds in Korea, in other words, have completely worked through the repositioning of the book, until sometime next year, maybe even to the end of next year. So that\u2019s going to continue to be a drag on us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">That\u2019s why when we look at Asia, Korea certainly is a weight on us, but Asia overall, we still have some good loan growth. And if you look in the back of the presentation material that we gave you, on slide 33, if you take a look at Asia, excluding Korea and Japan, year on year we\u2019re getting 10% loan growth coming out of Asia. So Korea\u2019s an anchor, but it\u2019s not the only thing that is propelling our business forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And then just finally, back home, any thoughts as to a potential settlement with Freddie? I know that Fannie was a bigger buyer of your mortgages over time, but any thoughts about potentially settling with the other side of the GSEs?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">What I would say is we won\u2019t comment on Freddie specifically, other than to just reaffirm that we\u2019re continuing to work through these things and get them behind us as a top priority.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Your next question comes from the line of David Hilder with Drexel Hamilton.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>David Hilder - Drexel Hamilton </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">A couple of numbers questions and then a policy question. Can you update us on what the Basel III risk-weighted assets in Citi Holdings are?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I don\u2019t have that number off the top of my head. But if you get ahold of IR, they\u2019ll be able to supply you with that. But I believe that it\u2019s now down to 21% of our total risk-weighted assets, but I don\u2019t have the math of that in my head.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>David Hilder - Drexel Hamilton </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And then in the reconciliation on page 43, where you list deductions from Basel III tier one as $45 billion for DTAs and other items. Is it fair to assume that most of that $45.3 billion is DTAs of one sort or another at this point?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>David Hilder - Drexel Hamilton </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And then finally, you talked about being engaged with regulators on the leverage proposal. Could you be more specific about that? Are you actually going to object to either the percentage or the way the denominator is calculated, for example?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I don\u2019t want to specify where we might object or anything like that, because when you look at what you\u2019re dealing with, risk-weighted assets, leveraged assets, liquidity rules, each one of these broad concepts is valid in its own right, and serves a purpose in ensuring the safety and soundness of the financial system. In almost every case, it\u2019s really a matter of degree and how well the various elements work together. And I think those are areas worth of discussion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Marquardt with Evercore.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">First, in terms of the runoff portfolio in North American mortgages, can you help us think about the pace of the runoff going forward? What\u2019s the appetite been like recently? You\u2019ve talked about that in the past. Any change in terms of, given the macro backdrop, potentially shifting again?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Well, as you\u2019ve seen, over the course of the last two quarters, we\u2019ve been able to sell about $6 billion of those mortgage loans. Roughly, a little bit shy of $3 billion in the first quarter and then $3.1 billion or so in the second quarter, as we took advantage of some favorable market conditions. A large portion of what we were able to sell in the first half of the year were these reperforming loans that I talked about earlier.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">And the pricing on those loans is really sensitive to yield. And so with the recent rise in interest rates, the market has changed for those reperforming loans. And so I\u2019ll have to reassess to see whether or not we can continue the pace of sale that we\u2019ve got for those types of assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">And I think as part of that, as we\u2019ve said historically, the focuses are a couple of things. One is that we want to obviously continue to reduce the size and drag of the portfolio, but that drag comes from a couple of perspectives. It not only comes from the cost of credit, it comes from the operating expenses associated with the portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">And when we can go in particular at the delinquent part of the portfolio, and continue to sell that part of the mix down, it allows us to go back and get out a lot of high costs. And so we\u2019re focused in the aggregate, derisking, getting smaller, reducing the drag, and so as the market affords opportunities, we\u2019re going to continue to try and take advantage of them.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">And in terms of accelerating the pace of that, you previously talked about that the buyer liquidity has been a hurdle, just given the size of the portfolio that you need to reduce. But then also you\u2019ve brought up how there\u2019s been a difference in lifetime loss estimates more recently. Can you expand on that point a little bit more in terms of what you mean, in terms of maybe just the buyer-seller perspective?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Historically, when we\u2019ve looked at or thought about some different larger, in particular bulk sales, there\u2019s at least three components that go into the pricing that comes in. One is what\u2019s the buyer\u2019s cost of money? Second is what are their expectations around loss rates? And the third is, you know, what\u2019s the capital they need to hold against it, and what\u2019s the cost of capital?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">I would say in most every instance, when we see that from a bulk perspective, the numbers or the math associated with each of those three things, from our perspective, makes it a sale that\u2019s not worthwhile. So, again, we pretty simply look at our own view towards those three things, and if somebody\u2019s willing to pay us what we think the value of those assets, or of those securities are, we\u2019re happy to sell them.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Today, in bulk form, we haven\u2019t seen that. If and when that opportunity presents itself, we\u2019d love to act on it. But we haven\u2019t seen that to date, and we\u2019re not running the portfolio with the belief that in the near term that\u2019s going to be out there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">And then separately, you had mentioned the LCR currently at about 110. Is that comparable to last quarter? If I have it correctly, 116?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Yes, that\u2019s perfectly comparable.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">And did I understand also that 110 is about the right level that you feel comfortable running at in terms of a buffer on top of the current minimums?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">That is the target that we established last quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">And then just lastly, kind of just stepping back. Can you help just frame out, in terms of your near term, long term, medium term goals of 10% ROE and ninety-one ten ROA, how the recent kind of global slowdown that you mentioned, as well as the U.S. mortgage market, may be shifting here? How much does that affect, if that all, those goals?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">We\u2019re not changing those goals. We said that those goals were constructed in what we believed to be a slower growth, challenging environment. We said that we would hope to be able to achieve those goals, and we hadn\u2019t built in interest rate rises into those pieces. And I think that as global growth presents a headwind, or the market presents a headwind, we\u2019ve got to take those in stride within the numbers that we\u2019ve put out there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">And at this time, there are no further questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Susan Kendall</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Thank you all for joining us here today.

Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Ms. Kendall, you may begin.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Susan Kendall</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Mike Corbat, will speak first. Then John Gerspach, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we\u2019ll be happy to take questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results in capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2012 Form 10-K.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you, Susan. Good morning everyone. Earlier today, we reported earnings of $3.2 billion for the third quarter. Excluding CVA and DVA and a tax benefit, net income was $3.3 billion, or $1.02 per share.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Our results reflect a challenging operating environment, including the slowdown in client activity based on uncertainty regarding Fed tapering, concerns about the effect of a U.S. government shutdown, and forecasts for slowing economic growth, particularly in the emerging markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Although I think we performed relatively well in this challenging, uneven environment, we cannot, and are not, satisfied with these results, and will be focusing on areas where we need to continue to improve.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Turning to our individual businesses, the macro-environment had the biggest impact in our markets businesses, and in particular fixed income, where the typical slowdown in third quarter activity levels was exacerbated.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We also pared back some of our risks in emerging markets that impacted trading opportunities, but it was the right thing to do for the firm. We have more work to do in equities, where our derivatives performance was not where we want it to be, but year to date we continue to make progress.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">As for investment banking, although there was some transactions we would have liked to participate in, we increased our share of wallet so far this year. Our transaction services businesses are still being affected by spread compression, but we continue to work hard to offset that through volume growth and increased market share.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">In trade loans, one of the several areas where we leverage our unique global network to a competitive advantage, new originations grew 23% year-to-year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In consumer banking, as expected, we face significant revenue pressure, as U.S. mortgage originations were sharply reduced, and we continue to adjust to regulatory changes in other markets, such as Korea.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We did see strong revenue and volume growth in other markets, several of which we\u2019ve designated as invest to grow. And importantly, credit trends remain favorable as we focus on our target segments around the world.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Although we can\u2019t control the revenue environment, we certainly can control our expenses, and expenses for the quarter were $11.7 billion, 4% below the second quarter and the prior year period. We achieved this while making investments and bearing the brunt of increased regulatory costs. We remain on track with the repositioning actions we announced late last year, which have helped reduce our headcount by over 10,000 people year-to-year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We\u2019re working on a variety of different efforts to improve our productivity. Some center on optimizing our global real estate footprint, and have resulted in reducing our portfolio of sites by 73. Others seek to reduce the turnaround time for transactions and improve the client experience. More importantly, we\u2019re instilling the need for these efforts to be business as usual and not episodic.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We also continue to make progress in two critical areas which I\u2019ve identified for you before, reducing the drag on earnings caused by Citi Holdings and the utilization of our deferred tax assets. We reduced our assets in Citi Holdings by $9 billion during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Holdings assets now total $122 billion and are 6% of our GAAP balance sheet, and even without the benefit of an incremental loan loss reserve release, Holdings net loss was reduced for the third consecutive quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">While legal costs associated with Citi Holdings will likely remain elevated in the near term, we took another significant step to get past legacy issues with our agreement with Freddie Mac, that following on to our agreement with Fannie Mae during the second quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Regarding our deferred tax assets, we consumed $500 million of DTA during the third quarter. This modest amount brings the 2013 total year to date to $1.8 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">As you know, I want Citi to be known as an indisputably strong and stable institution, and again we made progress towards this goal. The capital we generated this quarter, primarily through retained earnings and DTA utilization, resulted in our tier one common ratio increasing to an estimated 10.4% on a Basel III basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Other key metrics also strengthened, including our supplementary leverage ratio, which increased to an estimated 5.1%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Looking towards the end of the year, we believe it\u2019s going to remain a challenging environment, and growth uneven. As has been the case historically, transitioning from a lower to higher rate environment doesn\u2019t happen without causing disruptions, especially in the emerging markets, and we\u2019re clearly seeing evidence of that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In addition, the ongoing uncertainty regarding the Fed tapering is keeping many investors on the sidelines, and that may be for an extended period of time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In the U.S., the twin impact from the government shutdown and dangerous flirtation with the debt ceiling are clearly impacting the economy and the financial markets. The housing market is still in recovery mode, but we expect refinancing volumes to continue to decrease. We\u2019ll continue to take steps to make sure our mortgage and other consumer businesses are sized correctly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Internationally, emerging growth has slowed and will likely remain uneven, but we still believe these markets will outpace developed market growth. That being said, we manage our risk prudently and continue to adjust our appetite based on the latest trends and conditions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">John will go through the deck, and then we\u2019d be happy to take your questions. John?</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Thank you, Mike, and good morning everyone. To start, I\u2019d like to highlight some significant items affecting our results this quarter. First, CVA and DVA were negative $336 million pretax and $208 million after tax in the third quarter, for a negative impact on EPS of $0.07. We also recorded a tax benefit of $176 million related to the resolution of certain tax audit items, which had a positive impact on EPS of $0.06 per share.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">For comparison purposes, in the third quarter of 2012, CVA and DVA were negative $776 million pretax, or $485 million after tax, for a negative impact of $0.16 per share. We also had a tax benefit last year of $582 million, or $0.19 per share.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In addition, in the third quarter of 2012, we recorded a pretax loss of $4.7 billion related to to Morgan Stanley Smith Barney joint venture, which had a negative impact on EPS of $0.94 per share in that quarter. Adjusting for these items, we earned $3.3 billion in the third quarter of 2013, or $1.02 per share, as compared to $1.06 per share on an adjusted basis in the third quarter of 2012.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Throughout today\u2019s earnings presentation, I will be discussing our results, excluding CVA/DVA, the tax benefits, and gains or losses on the sale of minority investments, to provide comparability to prior periods.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On slide four, we show total Citigroup results for the quarter. We earned $3.3 billion in the third quarter, roughly flat to last year, as lower operating expenses and lower credit costs were offset by a decline in revenues and a higher tax rate.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Earnings per share declined 4%, including the impact of higher preferred dividends in the recent quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Citigroup end of period loans were flat year over year at $658 billion, as growth in Citicorp was offset by the continued decline in Citi Holdings, and deposits grew to $955 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On slide five, we provide more detail on revenues in constant dollars, which declined 4% from last year and 8% sequentially. As Mike discussed, we faced a challenging operating environment across many of our businesses in the third quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In consumer banking, revenues declined sequentially by roughly $350 million, primarily driven by lower U.S. mortgage refinancing activity, as well as the absence of a $180 million gain in the second quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Securities and banking revenues declined by nearly $1.3 billion sequentially, as a seasonal decline in activity in the third quarter was exacerbated by uncertainty around the timing of Fed tapering, the pending government shutdown, and other geopolitical events. We also incurred losses on loan hedges, as compared to gains in the prior quarter, as spreads tightened versus the end of the second quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In transaction services, revenues declined sequentially from a seasonally strong second quarter, which also included a $50 million gain. Year over year, revenues increased as growth in volumes and fees more than offset the impact of spread compression.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Holdings revenues were up versus prior periods, mostly driven by the absence of rep and warranty reserve bills this quarter. Finally, foreign currency translation accounted for roughly $200 million of the reported revenue decline versus prior periods.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">As we show on slide six, we maintained our focus on expense discipline in the third quarter. Excluding legal and repositioning costs, core operating expenses were roughly $10.8 billion, down over $400 million year over year, and over $250 million sequentially in constant dollars.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">At the end of the second quarter, I said we expected to see about $200 million of incremental repositioning savings by the end of the 2013. We achieved about half of that amount in the third quarter, or roughly $100 million. The incremental $150 million of expense savings this quarter was comprised of lower performance-based compensation and lower transaction costs, both of which were driven by the more challenging revenue environment in the third quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Legal costs remained elevated at nearly $700 million, mostly reported in Citi Holdings, and repositioning costs totaled $133 million for the third quarter, mostly in Citicorp. Year to date, repositioning costs have averaged around $125 million per quarter. Naturally, there will be some variability quarter to quarter in these costs as we continue to pursue our efficiency efforts, but we do not anticipate taking another very large repositioning charge similar to the fourth quarter of last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On slide seven, we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Citicorp generated third quarter revenues of $17 billion, and net income of $3.4 billion. Year over year, revenues declined 7% and expenses were down 6%, driven by repositioning savings, lower performance-based compensation, lower legal and related expenses, and the impact of FX.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Credit costs in Citicorp increased year over year. Net credit losses continued to improve. However, reserve releases in North America cards continued to decline and were partially offset by reserve builds in Latin America consumer. We also built reserves in our unfunded corporate portfolio, driven by an increase in commitments, as well as certain credits migrating to lower risk ratings in the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Year to date, Citicorp revenues grew 1% and expenses declined 3%, partially offset by the higher cost of credit, resulting in 5% growth in pretax earnings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to Citi Holdings, revenues were nearly $1.3 billion and the net loss declined to roughly $100 million in the third quarter. Citi Holdings ended the period with $122 billion of assets, or 6% of total Citigroup assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to Citicorp, on slide eight, we show results for international consumer banking in constant dollars. On this basis, revenues grew 2% year over year while expenses declined 1%. In Latin America, revenues grew 6% and expenses were up 4% from last year, while in Asia revenues declined 2% and expenses were down 4%. Revenues were down in EMEA, reflecting market exits in Turkey and Romania.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">International consumer revenues continued to reflect spread compression as well as the impact of regulatory changes in certain markets, including Korea. However, most underlying drivers showed sustained momentum in the third quarter. Total average loans grew 5% from last year, and card purchase sales were up 8%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Credit costs of $836 million in the third quarter were up 34% from last year. Net credit losses increased in dollar terms, but remained relatively stable as a percentage of loans.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We also built loan loss reserves including nearly $170 million in Latin America, roughly half of which was related to our exposure to the top three home builders in Mexico, with the remainder driven by continued portfolio growth as well as potential losses from recent hurricanes in that region.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">I mentioned last quarter that we continue to monitor the performance of our clients in the home building industry in Mexico, as well as the value of our collateral. At the end of the third quarter, our loans outstanding to the top three builders totaled less than $300 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">The loan loss reserve build in the recent quarter was driven by further deterioration in the financial and operating condition of these companies and decreases in the value of our collateral, resulting from the breach of certain of these clients\u2019 credit agreements with us as well as lower valuations.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We will continue to monitor the performance of our home builder clients as well as the value of our collateral to determine whether additional reserves or chargeoffs may be required in future periods.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On slide nine, we show revenue details for Asia consumers. Lower revenues in the third quarter reflected spread compression in retail banking as well as the continued impact of regulatory changes in certain markets, most significantly in Korea.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Sequentially, the decline was also driven by lower investment sales revenues, which tend to fluctuate more in line with retail investor sentiment and the broader capital markets environment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Card revenues improved both year over year and sequentially with continued growth in purchase sales across the region. And, we saw strong revenue growth in certain markets, including Hong Kong, India, Thailand, and China.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Turning to Korea, we are in an ongoing process to reposition our consumer franchise in that market to improve its operating efficiency and returns. And, upon completion, Korea should better reflect our consumer franchise elsewhere around the world, with a footprint more concentrated in the major cities and a focus on high quality consumer segments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We believe revenues in Korea could begin to stabilize in early 2014, but we expect this market to continue to present a drag on year over year revenue comparisons for Asia through at least next year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Slide 10 shows the results for North America consumer banking. Total revenues were down 12% year over year, and 6% sequentially. Retail banking revenues of $1.1 billion declined by 35% from last year and 29% sequentially, reflecting lower mortgage origination revenues as well as continued spread compression on deposits, partially offset by growth in deposits and commercial loans. Also, as we mentioned last quarter, our mortgage revenues in the second quarter included a gain of roughly $180 million on the sale of an on balance sheet mortgage portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Cards revenues of $3.6 billion were roughly flat versus last year, as an improvement in net interest spreads was offset by lower average loan balances. On a sequential basis, revenues grew 4% as average loan balances stabilized in Citi-branded cards and net interest spreads continued to improve.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">In retail services, spreads were lower, driven by a higher mix of deferred interest promotional balances, but loan balances grew due to the acquisition of the Best Buy portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Total operating expenses of $2.4 billion were down 4% year over year, primarily reflecting lower legal and related costs and repositioning savings. Third quarter results reflected a portion of the benefit we expect from actions we have taken to reduce the expense base in mortgages in light of the lower origination activities. However, we also saw higher expenses in cards as a result of the Best Buy portfolio acquisition.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">The net reduction in expenses quarter over quarter was mostly driven by continued repositioning actions, as well as reduced marketing expenses. Credit costs increased year over year as net credit losses continued to improve, but the loan loss reserve release also declined to just over $200 million, driven by cards.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Overall, while we face significant mortgage and spread-related headwinds in North America this quarter that are likely to continue, we also saw some progress in our core franchise. Average deposits continued to grow, up 8% year over year, including 15% growth in checking account balances. Commercial market loans were up 15%, and card purchase sales grew year over year in both portfolios.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Slide 11 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail. Credit quality in North America continued to improve in the third quarter, with a decline in the NCL rate reflecting both underlying improvement in the portfolio as well as the impact of purchase accounting for the Best Buy portfolio acquisition.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">In Asia and EMEA, we also saw stable to improving credit trends. And, in Latin America, the net credit loss rate has remained fairly flat for the past several quarters. We expect the fourth quarter NCL rate in Latin America to remain roughly flat to third quarter levels.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">However, as we\u2019ve stated previously, the rate could be higher if we incur any material losses on our exposures to home builders in Mexico. In addition, as I mentioned, we took reserves this quarter for estimated potential losses resulting from the two recent hurricanes in Mexico. Any such losses may increase our NCL rate in the coming quarters. However, we would expect these losses to be charged against the reserve and therefore they should be neutral to the overall cost of credit.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Slide 12 shows our securities and banking business. Revenues of $5.1 billion declined 10% from last year and 20% from the prior quarter. Investment banking revenues of $839 million were down 10% from the prior year and 19% from last quarter, mostly in line with the overall market. While revenues declined in the third quarter, our franchise continued to show momentum year to date, with revenues up 10% year over year and wallet share gains in most major products.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Equity market revenues of $710 million were up 36% from last year, reflecting market share gains as well as improvement in our derivatives trading performance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Sequentially, equity market revenues declined 25% as cash equity revenues declined broadly in line with overall market volumes and trading performance was weaker in derivatives. While our derivatives results were lower this quarter, we continue to make progress in building this franchise, which contributed to the 24% growth in equities revenues year to date.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Fixed income market revenues of $2.8 billion declined 26% from a particularly strong third quarter last year, when we benefited from an environment with strong liquidity, more robust client activity, and significant credit spread tightening. By contrast, the recent quarter reflected a general slowdown in client activity, exacerbated by uncertainty around the timing of Fed tapering, the pending government shutdown, and other geopolitical events.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Sequentially, fixed income revenues declined 17%, reflecting the slowdown in activity, as well as actions to pare back risk given volatility in the emerging markets. Private bank revenues of $614 million were up slightly from last year, and down 5% sequentially, driven by lower capital markets activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Lending revenues, excluding the impact of gains and losses on hedges related to accrual loans, were $377 million in the third quarter, down 10% from last year on lower volumes and down 16% sequentially on lower spreads as well as losses on loan sale activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Total operating expenses of $3.4 billion were down both year over year and sequentially, reflecting the impact of headcount reductions and lower performance-based compensation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">For the first nine months of 2013, total revenues increased 6% over last year, driven by equities and investment banking, while expenses declined 3%, resulting in 13% net income growth.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Moving to transaction services on slide 13, revenues of $2.6 billion were up 2% from last year in constant dollars, as strong fee income growth more than offset a decline in net interest revenues.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Treasury and trade solutions was up 1% as volume and fee growth was partially offset by the impact of spread compression globally, and securities and fund services revenues grew 3% as higher settlement volumes and fees more than offset lower spreads.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Sequentially, revenues declined 4%, reflecting seasonally strong client activity and a one-time gain of roughly $50 million in the prior quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Spread compression continued to dampen revenues this quarter. However, the volume drivers for transaction services showed sustained momentum. Trade loan originations grew 23% year over year. Average deposits were up 4%. Assets under custody grew by 9%, and [SFS] settlement volumes grew 11%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Expenses of $1.4 billion grew 4% year over year in constant dollars, driven mainly by higher volumes, partially offset by efficiency savings. While expense growth outpaced revenue growth in the third quarter, we continue to believe the business can achieve positive operating leverage in total for the second half of 2013, even when excluding the repositioning costs incurred in the fourth quarter of last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Slide 14 shows the results for corporate other. Revenues were up versus the prior year, driven by hedging activities, partially offset by lower AFS sales, while expenses declined, mostly reflecting lower legal and related costs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Assets of $313 billion included approximately $119 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $139 of liquid available for sale securities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Slide 15 shows Citi Holdings assets. We ended the quarter with assets of $122 billion in Citi Holdings, or 6% of total Citigroup assets. The $9 billion reduction in the third quarter reflected $4 billion of asset sales and $5 billion of net paydowns.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">On slide 16, we show Citi Holdings financial results for the quarter. Total revenues of $1.3 billion were up year over year and sequentially, primarily driven by the absence of rep and warranty reserve builds this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Citi Holdings expenses increased 16% year over year to $1.4 billion, driven by higher legal and related costs. Excluding these legal costs, core operating expenses declined 16% to roughly $790 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Net credit losses continued to improve in the third quarter, driven by North America mortgages. And we released $679 million of loan loss reserves, including a release of roughly $725 million in North America mortgages, partially offset by losses on asset sales.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Regarding the mortgage reserve release, roughly $425 million of reserves were utilized to offset net credit losses in the third quarter, and the incremental $300 million reserve release was driven by continued improvement in delinquencies and home prices year to date.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Looking to the fourth quarter, assuming the U.S. economic environment remains favorable, we expect to utilize loan loss reserves to offset virtually all of our mortgage net credit losses, but we do not currently anticipate additional reserve releases beyond that level. We ended the period with $5.7 billion of loan loss reserves allocated to North America mortgage loans in Citi Holdings or 40 months of NCL coverage.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Looking at the past five quarters of Citi Holdings results on slide 17, the pretax loss in Citi Holdings improved again this quarter, even excluding the incremental $300 million reserve release in mortgages. However, while the adjusted operating margin on the upper left panel on this slide increased significantly in the past two quarters to roughly $500 million, it will likely trend lower as each of the last two quarters included some level of positive marks or episodic gains.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">We expect mortgage net credit losses to continue to improve with reserve releases trending in line with NCLs. And legal costs will likely continue to be elevated and somewhat volatile in the near term.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">On slide 18, we show mortgage loan and adjusted net credit loss trends. We ended the quarter with $76 billion of North America mortgages in Citi Holdings, down 20% from a year ago, while net credit losses declined 50% and the loss rate improved by over 130 basis points.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">These mortgages include approximately $12 billion of loans originated in our legacy Citi Financial business, the vast majority of which are residential first mortgages. While the NCL rates on Citi Financial loans have improved, the loss rates on these loans tend to be higher at just over 5% in the third quarter, as compared to less than 1% for residential first mortgages originated by Citi Mortgage. We sold roughly $500 million of mortgages this quarter, most of which were nonperforming, for a total of $6.4 of mortgage sales year to date.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">On slide 19, we show delinquency trends, including both residential first mortgages and home equity loans. 30-plus day delinquencies continue to improve, down 9% sequentially, to $5 billion. FICO and LTV trends also remain favorable through the third quarter, and we provide these details in the appendix on slide 38.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">On slide 20, we show Citigroup\u2019s net interest revenue and margin trends. Net interest revenues totaled $11.5 billion in the third quarter. In constant dollars, net interest revenue was roughly flat to the prior quarter and down slightly versus last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Our net interest margin in the third quarter decreased by 4 basis points, reflecting lower loan yields and an increase in cash balances, partially offset by an improvement in funding costs. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect NIM to remain roughly flat.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">On slide 21, we show our key capital metrics through the third quarter. Under Basel III, our estimated tier one common ratio increased to 10.4%, driven by retained earnings and DTA utilization. Citigroup\u2019s estimated supplementary leverage ratio was 5.1%, up from 4.9% last quarter, and the supplementary leverage ratio for Citibank remained above 6% for the third quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">In summary, we clearly faced a challenging environment in the third quarter, with a slowdown in client activity, a continued low rate environment, and declining mortgage originations all posing significant headwinds.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">But against this backdrop, we managed our business well, with a continued focus on efficiency and growing our loan portfolio in a disciplined manner. We are on track to meet the repositioning targets we announced at the end of last year, and underlying credit performance remained favorable.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">We also continue to make significant progress in winding down Citi Holdings, which is now just 6% of total Citigroup assets. Year to date, the quarterly drag from Citi Holdings is down significantly from last year, even excluding the incremental mortgage reserve release this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And, finally, we continue to grow our capital, benefitting from a combination of earnings and further DTA utilization. We ended the quarter with an estimated Basel III tier one common ratio of 10.4%, and an estimated supplementary leverage ratio of 5.1%, one of the strongest capital positions in our industry.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Looking to the fourth quarter, in North America consumer we expect continued headwinds in mortgages, although some of this pressure should be offset by additional revenues from the acquisition of the Best Buy portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Net credit loss trends in North America should remain favorable, although we expect net loan loss reserve releases to moderate given the need to build reserves for new loans originated in the Best Buy portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">In international consumer, in total we expect continued volume growth, albeit somewhat offset by ongoing spread compression globally. Growth will likely be driven by Latin America, as we expect our repositioning efforts in Korea to continue to present a drag on year over year revenue comparisons in Asia in the near term. And, international consumer credit costs should generally trend in line with loan growth.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Turning to our institutional businesses, our securities and banking results will likely continue to reflect the overall market environment, with a goal of steadily gaining wallet share over time with our target clients.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And, in transaction services, we expect continued volume and fee growth to help offset the ongoing pressure of the low rate environment. So, in total we see a continued challenging operating environment in the near term, but we remain focused on those aspects of our business that we can control.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Our results year to date reflect the strength of our franchise and our progress towards our key priorities: gaining share with our clients, generating consistent earnings, and building our capital base.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And with that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p8\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">[Operator instructions.] And your first question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I was wondering how you\u2019re feeling about some of the 2015 financial targets. If we look at the ROA target of 90 to 110 basis points in 2015, we look at this quarter at [59] basis points year to date, around 80, what do you see as the key driver to getting toward the 2015 goal?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">As we\u2019ve talked about, reducing the losses in Citi Holdings is certainly one of the key goals that we see driving us toward the goal of generating ROA of between 90 and 110 basis points in 2015. And we\u2019d also look for some modest amount of net income improvement coming out of Citicorp as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">On the Citicorp side, I guess the efficiency goal is part of those 2015 targets around mid-50s, I'd just call it 55. You had 61 this quarter on the efficiency ratio, and 57 year to date. So I guess that implies some additional savings to be realized or revenue growth? Can you talk about getting to those efficiency goals?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yeah, as we said when Mike laid out those efficiency goals back in March, the environment that we anticipated was low single digit growth in revenues, and I think that\u2019s pretty much the environment that we\u2019ve seen, and certainly might expect to see in the near term.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So we do anticipate most of the contribution towards those efficiency targets to come out of the expense line. And, I think as you\u2019ve seen, we\u2019ve been delivering on the repositioning savings that we talked about after that fourth quarter reserve that we took last year, and we continue to try to find additional efficiency savings throughout the businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And just on that, you mentioned the incremental efficiency saves this quarter. Can you just remind us, if you tally up what you were shooting for with last year\u2019s, I think it was 900 this year, where are you on that cumulatively?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">As we said at the end of the second quarter, I walked everybody through where we were, and we said our estimate that was that you\u2019d see $300 million of the savings in the run rate in the fourth quarter. The $300 million, therefore, representing exactly what we had said we would get, which is a total annual save of $1.2 billion. And we had about $200 million of additional run rate savings to generate from the end of the second quarter. And as I mentioned, we generated about half of that, say $100 million, in the third quarter. So we\u2019ve got about $100 million more to bake into our fourth quarter results.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So we should look for that to kind of come off the 10.8 adjusted expense number, assuming a similar revenue environment?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">If volumes and the environment stays the same, you\u2019ll see the repositioning savings come through maybe partially offset by some incremental seasonal marketing expenses. So I don\u2019t want you to just take the 10.843 and take an even $100 off and get 10.743. The roundings could end up leaving us rounding at 10.8. But you should see the expenses come down, again, assuming the environment stays where it is.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Understood. But thinking about next year, as we go from 2014 to 2015, it seems that if revenues aren\u2019t going to get better, you would need to do more than 10.7, 10.8, or beyond the re-positioning saves you\u2019ve announced for this year to get that efficiency ratio towards the 2015 target. So it seems reasonable to expect more saves, whether you announce them or not, in 2014?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Well, as I said, we\u2019re going to be committed to delivering the efficiency targets as we laid out for 2015. And as you noted, year to date we\u2019ve already got an efficiency ratio of 57% in Citicorp. So I think that we\u2019ve already made a fair bit of progress this year in going from where we ended up in 2012. So I think we\u2019ll continue to make progress toward the 2015 goal in 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with ISI.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">A two-parter, quickly, on reserves. One, I just want to make sure the reserve build that you spoke about, especially on the international side, is a function of growth and not some concerns on credit?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">The two particular areas of \u201ccredit concerns\u201d that we had in the quarter were the home builder loans that I mentioned and the impact of those two hurricanes that hit Mexico during the month of September. So when you think about the $170 million reserve build that I mentioned for Latin America, three quarters, maybe a little bit more of that build, were really associated with those two items. And the rest is portfolio growth.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And then you also said inside holdings, I think, this quarter, you had the 725. You broke down the portion related to losses, and the portion related to just overage, and led us to not more than just losses in the fourth quarter. Just curious, you follow that up with 40 months of coverage. What\u2019s holding back a little bit more? Because the trends on credit seem great.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yeah, the trends on credit are great, and like anything else, we\u2019d like to see where the environment is going into the fourth quarter. There still is a bit of an unsettled environment out there as you may know, and you may see yourself.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">But in general, when you look at 40 months of coverage - and I\u2019m not saying we\u2019re always going to stay at 40 months of coverage - it won\u2019t be unusual, or shouldn\u2019t be unusual, for us to have a fairly high month\u2019s coverage ratio on NCLs when you think about the fact that TDR - troubled debt restructurings - represent just under 20% or so of our first mortgage portfolio on holdings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And as you think about it, the LLR that you need to hold for a TDR is, for all intents and purposes, a discounted value of a life of loan reserve. So, as such, I just think you should expect that our LLR is going to continue to represent fairly significant months of NCL coverage for some time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">The mortgage revenue runoff will happen quickly, as we\u2019ve seen, and typically there\u2019s an expense lag of a quarter or two. Is there anything material you can point to that over the next couple of quarters, as you adjust on that lag, that even in a no-change world, you\u2019ll get some efficiencies just from running through the normal process?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">You\u2019re referring in this instance to the mortgage business in corp, not the holdings run?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So what we\u2019ve spoke to is we\u2019ve clearly, as a company, clearly as an industry, seen the slowdown coming out of the changes [stance] in May for the Fed. And we started very quickly in anticipating that to take actions in the second quarter. We\u2019ve taken more actions in the third quarter. You\u2019ve probably read in the press some of those actions we\u2019ve taken. Unfortunately, there\u2019s a lag to that, because in the area of fulfillment, we\u2019ve got commitments that we need to process and get through the pipes. But we\u2019re focused on it, and clearly making sure that our mortgage business fits what we see as the future capacity, future necessity and demand of that sector.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Last one is, just in [FIC], I understand the choppiness, and you referred to it a couple of times, on the macro stuff, that delayed the quarter or impacted the quarter. Just curious if it was particularly acute within emerging market FX or within credit, just so we can adjust for ourselves. Because we\u2019re well below something like a 12-quarter average number.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And when you think about the impact on the [FIC] revenues, it certainly had the largest product that was impacted quarter on quarter and year over year, was certainly our rates and currencies business. And you wouldn\u2019t be wrong in thinking about the fact that there was a fair degree of that impact that was concentrated in the emerging markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And that\u2019s really due to the fact that in the third quarter, even towards the end of June, we saw a high amount of volatility in certain emerging markets. And in some cases we saw spreads widening between 50 and 250 basis points. So as a result, we pared back our risk in many of those markets, while still providing liquidity to our customers during this period of turmoil.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So I\u2019d say that the combination of the high volatility and our intentionally running a lower risk in many of the markets made for a more difficult environment for us to capture trading opportunities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy - RBC </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">On the $300 million of Mexican loans that you identified, what types of loans to builders? Are they more land loans, or are they working capital loans? What type of loans are they?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">They\u2019re development loans. They\u2019re, you know, building loans as far as people are building. They have the land, and they\u2019re looking for construction type of loans.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy - RBC </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And in terms of your transaction business, you talked about the challenges that you\u2019re having with the spreads, and it\u2019s been like this for some time, because of the low rate environment. Can you share with us what kind of interest rate environment would be ideal for that business to start seeing wider spreads?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Rising rates, but particularly rising rates in the current to five-year area. So far, to the extent we\u2019ve had any sort of rising rate environment, it\u2019s been more out towards the 10-year and higher. And we really need the shorter tenures to begin to rise to really benefit that business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy - RBC </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Would you benefit more for the rates here in the U.S. or in the E.U., or is it 50-50? Which rates may work better, once they start rising?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">U.S. rates would definitely have a faster and certainly more impactful hit on us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy - RBC </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">You, like your peers, I presume, have made comments to the Federal Reserve about the SLR that they\u2019ve proposed. What\u2019s you folks\u2019 view on the possibility of them easing up, or giving you guys some relief in the way they\u2019re defining the assets that you\u2019re going to use, and the denominator for that equation, such as cash at central banks? Do you think they might pull that out of the equation? Or are they really focused on just keeping it the way it is?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">That\u2019s a little difficult to answer. The comment period only ended a brief time ago, and so there\u2019s a lot to see how the Fed and others take a look at the various comment letters that were submitted. And I\u2019d say that, as I normally do, we continue to have constructive dialogues with our regulators, and so we\u2019ll have to see how they react.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy - RBC </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Coming back to Citi Holdings and talking about the loan loss reserve releasing, if we were to see housing prices appreciate in 2014 in the mid to high single-digits, down from where we\u2019ve seen low double-digits, would that give you more confidence to release more reserves?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I don\u2019t want you to think that the amount of loan loss reserves that we think we need to hold is solely linked to home price movements. It\u2019s that, it\u2019s also a bit of the overall economy. So there\u2019s a lot. There\u2019s what\u2019s going on with delinquencies. And, as I mentioned to one of the prior callers, it also has to do with the amount of TDRs that we have in the portfolio, where you\u2019re really then dealing with, like I said, almost a discounted life of loan reserve. And that\u2019s not necessarily going to get influenced tremendously by movements in HPI.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy - RBC </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And then finally, John, on slide 31 you guys give us good detail on the consumer credit delinquency trends, and obviously they\u2019re going in the proper direction for the total portfolio. Are there any of those subsectors, whether it\u2019s Mexico or Korea, that concern you the most, or what we should kind of keep an eye on? Because the total numbers are good, but some of the subsectors are going the opposite direction.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I\u2019d say that the ones that you would think about are the ones that we\u2019re focused on as well, which is, as I mentioned, Mexico. Not that we\u2019ve got a tremendous worry in Mexico, but we called out a couple of things with the home builders. And we\u2019ll have to assess the impact of the recent storms. Mexico is also going through a period where they\u2019re still absorbing the change in administration and a lot of the reform work that is going on with the new administration, so we think that long term that\u2019s beneficial, but it\u2019s certainly had a slowdown in growth in the near term in Mexico. But Mexico, Korea, those are certainly the countries where we\u2019ve got the two largest portfolios, and so those are certainly two good ones to watch.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Just a quick question. You\u2019re down to 6% of assets out of Citi Holdings, but the RWAs are still at 20%. Is that all a function of the mortgage side? Or are there some idiosyncratic or large RWA assets in, say, SAP that we could see some more progress on the RWAs on the Basel III side?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">It\u2019s a combination of both things. There are, as you put it, some idiosyncratic, but they\u2019re somewhat small as well. The largest impact we\u2019re going to have on driving down RWA, over time, will still be resident with the mortgages. But, you know, there are a few things that are in SAP<strong>, </strong>such as we\u2019ve got a lot of the hold to maturity securities, and that\u2019s going to certainly impact us. And the other one that sort of exists below the surface is op risk. Don\u2019t forget, op risk also, when you get into a Basel III environment, there\u2019s a decent chunk of your RWA that is constituted by op risk. And that is a much longer term part of your capital base to try to get rid of. So it\u2019s largely mortgages. There\u2019s a couple of things in SAP that could give us a pop, but op risk is also going to take some time to work our way out of.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Should we expect any pop from the sale of some of the hedge fund and private equity assets that looks like will close in the fourth quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Not really.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And maybe another question on the SLR. It seems like there\u2019s been more effort to use compression trades and it\u2019s unclear on the benefits of OTC clearing, but I would assume that would also be positive on notional value. Have you got any sense whether you think that\u2019s a big item, a small item? And obviously you can\u2019t give any numbers, but do you think that could have some positive impact on SLR going forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I clearly think it could have a positive impact on the SLR going forward. I think the magnitude of the impact is something that we\u2019ll have to see over time, just to see just how much of that we can actually accomplish.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And last question, just on CCAR. You guys, obviously with one of the strongest Basel III ratios, the new stress test will partially use Basel III, and your SLR is above 5% already, do you guys feel a lot better, still cautious? How do we think about your approach to CCAR at the end of this year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Well, I think versus a year ago, I\u2019d say we certainly feel better, and we feel better by a few things. We laid out that we wanted to get the right result in terms of last year\u2019s submission. I think we got that, and I think, importantly, it just wasn\u2019t the quantitative piece, it was the qualitative piece.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And since then, I think we\u2019ve shown the ability to generate capital in a meaningful way when we kind of get the right things working. The combination of corporate earnings, reducing the drag in holdings, the utilization, the DTA, and I think we\u2019ve started to build a track record of that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">But I think we\u2019ve got more work to do. We continue to be in a challenging operating environment, and as John and I have described, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to change. And at this point, we really don\u2019t know the scenarios and what they\u2019re going to be, so we\u2019ll take those on board, we\u2019ll see how the fourth quarter shapes up, and then we\u2019ll start to make some decisions in terms of what our submission might look like.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question comes from Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">First question is on one of the items that you think broadly you can control, which is your expense structure. Obviously securities and banking saw a pretty significant decline in revenue and we know that expenses can be sticky, but it seemed as if they were very sticky when you look at the efficiency ratio there, even ex the DVA issues. And I was wondering is there some high level of litigation reserve build maybe that\u2019s encompassed within the expenses there this quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">There\u2019s a minor amount of litigation expenses, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything that would be driving the expense [due] in securities and banking. Otherwise we would have called it out for you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I think you might have mentioned in a [unintelligible] or earlier today that you saw private label securities as still an open issue, and I wasn\u2019t sure what you exactly meant to say with that. But maybe you can give us a sense for whether we should be expecting more litigation reserve build as a result of that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I think the question was more in terms of what issues remain open from a litigation point of view relating to mortgages. And it was more on dealing with holdings and the litigation expenses that we had in holdings, and the fact that with the agreements now that we had reached with Fannie and Freddie, we had pretty much put the repurchase risk with those two - the GSEs - behind us. And my comment was that the largest remaining area of mortgage litigation that I think the industry still faced had to do with private label securitizations.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And if you were building reserves for the private label litigations that did affect you for underwriting and originations that you had done prior to 2009, would that reserve build be in holdings?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yes, it would.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And the final question, since we\u2019re talking about holdings expense levels, is as you called out, ex all that stuff, your expense levels in holdings were down about 16% year over year, which is obviously the trend that we all want to see. But I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more guidance over the next one to two years how should we see the expense that\u2019s in place for managing all those Citi Holdings assets come down as the assets do.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">It\u2019s tough to predict what asset sales will look like. Clearly we\u2019ve been in a transitioning rate environment, and John had talked about our desire to sell reperforming mortgages and also not only shed the asset but take the expense out. So I think in this environment it\u2019s tough to know and have a crystal ball looking forward in terms of what sales will look like, and therefore I think it\u2019s difficult to judge what expense reductions will look like. But as we\u2019ve been, we\u2019re going to continue to be focused on trying to manage those expenses down. And again, as we look at asset sales, it\u2019s not just about the asset sale, the capital release, the risk reduction, it\u2019s also about the expense reduction. We look at those things in aggregate, and we\u2019re going to continue to do that and take advantage of those things that are out there. But really tough to predict.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And then maybe just a follow up on that. Maybe you can give us an update on how you\u2019re managing One Main?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">One Main is a business that we put through a pretty sizable restructuring. Probably today one of a few, if not only, of scale branch base subprime consumer lending businesses. Not a business, as we\u2019ve said, that fits long term with us. But again, I think things that have gone on from a regulatory and credit dynamic, there\u2019s a real part of society that needs to be served. We think One Main is very well-positioned to do that. And at the point in time where somebody comes along and is willing to pay us a price that we think the business is worth, then we\u2019ll be happy to consider that. But until that, we\u2019re going to continue to run the business and have it best positioned for that day.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer &amp; Company.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer &amp; Company </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Just a follow up on the difference between RWAs and assets in holdings. You mentioned that a big portion of the difference is operating risk. And most of holdings looks like a mortgage company now, and I\u2019m wondering to what extent is there still an operating mortgage company there? I thought of it mainly as just basically holdings of loans and assets as opposed to an operating company.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Well, you do have to service those assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer &amp; Company </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So it\u2019s purely a servicing, it\u2019s not an origination\u2026</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Correct. And you may think about the fact that certainly in the last couple of years a lot of the expense that has been incurred by people in the industry, including elevated NCL rates, including some of the additional expense dollars that people have had to put in it, have been associated with what has been determined to be operating deficiencies for these mortgages. So there is still a certain amount of op risk that we need to account for in our Basel III risk weighted asset determination.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer &amp; Company </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">But should we expect over time that the RWAs will track down roughly in line with the asset decline? Because we didn\u2019t see that this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Well, let\u2019s see. On holdings, the GAAP assets came down $9 billion and the risk-weighted assets and holdings came down about 13. So it\u2019s more or less in line. Again, it has to do with mix and everything else. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to be able to just look always and say it\u2019s exactly in a ratio of X to X. Plus, as I mentioned, that op risk does not come down ratably based upon the sale of assets. To the extent I\u2019m servicing a loan, I still have op risk.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer &amp; Company </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And then another question just on the Best Buy acquisition. Should we expect that to have roughly the same profitability of your other partner cards? Or theoretically should it be disproportionately better impact? And I would assume there\u2019s some that you\u2019d get efficiencies on the expense side in managing that in your existing business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I would say that over time you should expect it to contribute to increased profitability in retail services, but in the near term it\u2019s likely to actually be a drag on profitability growth, only because of the mechanics that are involved in calculating now the loan loss reserves that we need to put on Best Buy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">You know, under purchase accounting the acquired portfolios now we bring them on our books at fair market value, which means they come on without any loan loss reserve. Therefore, as you build each new loan, as each new incremental loan comes on your books, you need to start putting up loan loss reserves for the estimated inherent losses in those loans. And there\u2019s no benefit from old loans rolling off your books, so you don\u2019t see any reduction in LLR because you\u2019ve got old loans rolling off.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So the first 12 months, maybe the first 15 months, of the acquisition, you\u2019re going to see an accelerated build of LLR, just resulting from the mechanics, before everything smooths itself out.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And the tax books work the same way?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Well, the tax books, the tax return, won\u2019t reflect. But I think what you\u2019re interested in is the DTA aspect.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Correct. Do acquisitions help the DTA?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">They do over the longer term, but I take tax benefit for the LLR just as I do with any other business. So, again, the first year or so, it will be less beneficial than you might otherwise think.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And then finally, just to ask Guy\u2019s question a different way, in securities and banking we saw revenues go from $6.4 billion to $5.1 billion, so down $1.3 billion, but expenses only came down $100 million. And should one just not look at it on a linked-quarter basis? I mean, it just didn\u2019t seem like they came down in line with revenues.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I actually agree with your comment. I think that quarter on quarter expense variations in that business can be a bit misleading. I personally believe that to really get a true picture of how a firm is managing its expense base, you need to look at its performance over a full year. And I think if you do the analysis, and if you look at the expenses in that business\u2026</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Just take out our fourth quarter \u201912 repositioning reserve, and look at those expenses on a trailing 12 month basis, for a run of quarters, what you\u2019re going to see is that expenses, both in the ICG and securities and banking have been steadily declining since the first quarter of last year. So on a trailing 12 months basis, the efficiency ratios in both ICG and securities and banking have also been steadily improving during that same timeframe.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And I think that if you take a look at that and you compare our efficiency ratios on a trailing 12 month basis over that timeframe with our peer institutions, using the ICG ratios for the universal banking peers and the security and banking ratios for our more pure play investment banking peers, I think you\u2019re going to find that we hold up pretty well and almost every quarter our trailing 12 month expense efficiency is better than each of our peers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I wanted to follow up on that last question, and it\u2019s been asked several times. So if we were to accept that your trailing 12 month expense efficiency looks good, but still I think the issue is the quarter on quarter decline. You said it could be misleading in the bigger picture of things. But at the same time, what we\u2019ve heard is macro still has headwinds, markets are still unsettled, it\u2019s a challenging operating environment, and you only have $100 million of savings left. So I think the concern is, is this potentially an inflection point for what\u2019s been a decent trailing 12 month record, but now we\u2019re going into an area that\u2019s maybe not going to get us positive operating leverage?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">When we laid out our public targets in spring, we laid out an efficiency ratio which we then went on and spoke to what portion of that\u2019s consumer versus what\u2019s ICG. And we spoke to mid to high 50s for ICG. And so clearly those businesses have taken that on. And again, we\u2019ve talked about tepid top line growth in terms of low single digits, and the businesses have to onboard that, and they have. And they\u2019ve got to work to achieve that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a mystery, or there\u2019s any surprise to what needs to be done. And again, I think those metrics were designed without looking at overreaching revenue targets. And so, again, I think they\u2019re in line, and we\u2019ll continue to adjust.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And I think you\u2019ve seen, away from the significant repositioning charge in the fourth quarter, us at a run rate somewhere plus or minus $100 million or $125 million a quarter. Again, going at it in that BAU we described. And obviously some of that\u2019s coming out of ICG, and we\u2019d expect them to keep continue doing that in their business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So how should I think about this? For the firm as a whole, revenues from the second to the third</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">quarter were down $1.6 billion, and expenses were down roughly $300 million. So that\u2019s a $1.3 billion gap linked quarter. To get the other $100 million of savings, it\u2019s still a $1.2 billion gap. So either revenues need to improve or stabilize in certain areas, or expenses have to go down a lot. Where is the extra leverage?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Mike, I still think you\u2019re focused on the quarter to quarter. And again, the targets that we set out were targets for a full year. And I think that when you take a look at performance, you want to judge the performance over a full year. Now, granted, if you want to take a look out of full year, that\u2019s okay. So judge us by how we perform then, over that full year, when we get there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">But the targets specifically that we set out for securities and banking back in March is we said that in 2015 we would be able to run securities and banking with an efficiency ratio of between 55% and 60%. And people at that point in time thought that that was a pretty good target to aim for. Well, in fact, if you take a look at our securities and banking business, on a trailing 12 month basis, we\u2019re operating that business at a 57% efficiency ratio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Yeah, I guess the test will be a year from now, as we look back. Are you as confident as you were before that you\u2019ll have positive operating leverage looking ahead?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">We\u2019re still committed to getting to the efficiency ratios that we laid out for 2015, as well as the ROA targets that we laid out for 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">If I can shift gears, on Citi Holdings, what were the losses on the asset sales of $4 billion?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I don\u2019t have that number in my head. I\u2019m sorry.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">But it was a loss?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I don\u2019t even know. It could have been a slight net gain. I actually think it was a slight positive this quarter. That\u2019s one of the reasons why I called out the fact that the 0.5 in that upper left quadrant of that one chart is something that I think will likely come down, just because there were some episodic gains in that 0.5.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So how should we think about pretax earnings and holdings? The last four quarters, it\u2019s gone from negative $1.7 billion, negative $1.3 billion, negative $900 million, negative $500 million. So that\u2019s a nice trend, but you said don\u2019t read too much into home price appreciation. So if we were trying to model that, what would you point us to?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Well, our target is still to drive holdings to breakeven, to close to breakeven, by 2015. And I think that we\u2019re still on a path to do that, but I don\u2019t want you to think that that path is going to be linear. There\u2019s likely to be some ups and downs in that. But in general, the trend is moving towards breakeven by 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Since you\u2019re getting so close to that target now, why wouldn\u2019t you revise that projection from 2015 to, say, late 2014 even?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Well, the target that we put out was in March, so we\u2019re seven months into achieving a target that we said we would do over, you do the math. I guess it\u2019s somewhere around 33 months. So we still have 26 months to go to the end of 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And then as it relates to emerging markets, you said revenues in Korea should stabilize early next year. With all the regulatory and other changes taking place there, what gives you that confidence?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Just the way we\u2019re looking at the business. And again, when I throw things out like that, that\u2019s what we think should happen. And it\u2019s based upon how we see the runoff in existing portfolios that we think are going to come down, and based upon the environment that we see. If there\u2019s a significant change in the environment, then, as we always do, we will update you on our new views.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Can you remind us how long you\u2019ve been repositioning Korea? It\u2019s been a couple of years now?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">It certainly has been in excess of one year, yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And last question, going from what you can control to what you can\u2019t control, as it relates to the government situation in the U.S., have you been selling Treasuries to help protect yourself?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">As a matter of fact, I got that question earlier today on the media call. And yes, we no longer hold any U.S. Treasuries that have a maturity date prior to November 1. And quite frankly we have a very de minimis amount that have maturities prior to November 16.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Your next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">On the card business, as you\u2019re seeing now kind of stabilization in the branded card business, and you\u2019ve got the Best Buy assets, there was a mention of actually reduced marketing. Can you talk a little bit about your plans, both for the branded card business and whether there are other opportunities out there to grow or acquire in the private label business?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">You just went back and forth, so I want to make sure I answer the exact question that you\u2019ve put out. And I thought I heard you first ask about the branded cards business with marketing. And I think that you\u2019ll see that we are still in the process of repositioning the branded cards business. We did delay. We didn\u2019t have much to talk about with branded cards, quite frankly, in the third quarter. You\u2019re likely to see some additional advertising and marketing as we move into the fourth quarter. And hopefully what I think you\u2019ll see over the course of the fourth quarter, and then into 2014, is some new product offerings and some revitalized product offerings that we should have in branded cards. Your question on retail services, that\u2019s much more of an ongoing operation with the retail services, and the big change there of course is the acquisition of the Best Buy portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And I would say to that point, it\u2019s been asked before, we\u2019re absolutely open to more portfolio purchases, but those portfolio purchases need to make sense from a yield, returns, resource deployment perspective. People have often said, well, do you rationalize it from a DTA perspective? One thing we look at are that the underlying fundamentals of the portfolio purchase have to make sense before we consider the DTA benefit. But if there are things out there that make sense, we\u2019ll certainly take a look at them.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And on a slightly separate topic, the questions about Citi Holdings have been asked several different times, but you\u2019ve got $1.2 billion of revenue, and $1.4 billion in expenses. So your preprovision is a couple hundred million negative. But embedded in that expense is $600 million of legal. Is there kind of a run rate that you would expect kind of irrespective of all those volatile items of legal, and then something on top of that that we should expect? Or is that kind of not a way that you can look at it at this point.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Well, exactly what you have just pointed out is the exact point that I was trying to make by having you focus on the upper left quadrant of that slide that we had earlier, the four panel slide dealing with Citi Holdings. And you\u2019re right, when you move out the litigation expenses, we have $500 million of PPNR, adjusted PPNR, in that number.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">The issue there is, as I mentioned, there\u2019s some element of episodic gains that is built into that number, and asset marks. And so I don\u2019t want you to think that represents a run rate. As you can imagine, holdings is a collection of some businesses, a lot of different portfolios, a couple of different assets, and so I don\u2019t want you to think in terms of now we\u2019ve hit a run rate of $500 million of adjusted PPNR in that business. It will fluctuate.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Right. Although I would assume that, One Main was alluded to before, that that\u2019s a big driver of that, and that\u2019s something that should be stable, if not actually growing, right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Spot on.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">John, a question for you just to follow up on your guidance in terms of operating leverage trends, specifically within Korea. You mentioned that you expect revenues to stabilize early in 2014, and that operating leverage would be positive in your forecast for the full year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I think you\u2019re linking two different comments that I made. The comment that I made on Korea as far as revenues stabilizing, that is particular to the global consumer business in Korea. The comment that I think I made as far as positive operating leverage in the second half of this year was on the transaction services business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Then I guess what is your outlook for operating leverage trends within the Korea consumer business over the course of the next six to 12 months? Asia more broadly had slightly lower revenues year over year, but your expense control more than offset that within Asia. I guess I\u2019m just curious as to how you\u2019re thinking about the revenue trends within Korea could affect the overall Asia operating leverage trend?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yeah, and it has a dampening<strong> </strong>effect on that trend, and that\u2019s one of the reasons why we talked about the fact that Korea could be a drag on Asia performance over time. And so it will be a drag. But I didn\u2019t, nor do I want to, comment specifically on operating leverage in Korea itself, or in any other specific country.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Just moving on to the slide on corporate loan details within Brazil, India, and China, which was very interesting, I guess I\u2019m just curious, given how low the loss rates are in those countries - and I appreciate a lot of that is due to the loan mix - are the loan mixes in some of your smaller exposures within EM markets similar in terms of the CTS and TF composition? Or are they more varied across the smaller exposures you have in EM?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Well, the loan composition in each country will be slightly different. You can see how the loan composition inside China, India, and Brazil are somewhat different. But the trend is still going to be much more towards loans for either local market champions - in other words those really high quality emerging market headquartered companies - or to subsidiaries of companies that are headquartered in the development markets, and then with a fairly decent dose, where we have it, of trade-related. So the mix will vary, but it\u2019s going to look something like this if you think about the way these three countries are portrayed.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And then just one final question on the domestic mortgage portfolio. In the North American home equity portfolio within Citi Holdings, the credit performance has obviously gotten a lot better. I guess I\u2019m curious as to how you think about a higher rate environment potentially affecting the home equity portfolio specifically, and the ability of those homeowners to continue to make payments, or what the effect of a higher rate environment on that portfolio might be in terms of credit performance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I think you\u2019ve hit on the single largest risk that does impact the home equity book in holdings. And it\u2019s something that we think a lot about, and it drives a lot of our thought as far as what level of reserves that we need to have. We\u2019ve also given you some additional disclosure in our recent Qs as far as what percentage of that portfolio begins to hit resets in \u201915, \u201916, and \u201917. I don\u2019t have all those numbers in my head, but if you go to our most recent Q, and we\u2019ll do it again on this upcoming Q, we\u2019ll lay that out for you as far as the reset risk that we have in that portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Erika Penala Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I just had one follow up question. On the four-panel slide that you referred to, the message is clear that adjusted PPNR may be lower than we\u2019ve seen over the past few quarters, but still positive. And when you said you\u2019re utilizing reserves for future chargeoffs, that implies to me your provision. I guess is it fair to conclude that when you get to breakeven, the holdings have to do with your legal and related costs at this point?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I would say that, again, there will be some variability, as you just laid out, in that upper quadrant. And I\u2019m not going to say that it could never go negative. I don\u2019t want you to think that that\u2019s always going to be positive. There\u2019s a chance it could go slightly negative depending upon how low the asset volumes get in the business, etc. But you\u2019re absolutely right, the single largest driver of when we are able to get to holdings to be consistently breakeven really has to do with the legal and related costs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Guggenheim Securities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I wanted to kind of go back to the CCAR question and just focus on dividends. As you\u2019re going through the reinstitution of your dividend, how do you think about that when you kind of look at the volatility of earnings that have been anywhere from a quarterly run rate of close to $1 this quarter or at the top end was close to $1.30, given the Fed gives you about a 30% kind of leeway. How do you think about that when you go to establish this dividend level going into next year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I think when you look at it, the corporate finance math pretty clearly points you towards a preference of buyback versus dividend as your stock trades below book. And so I think that will be the first bias. But at that point, we also understand that we, to some degree, need to be mindful, and over time continue to address the dividend issue. So we\u2019ll look at those tradeoffs as we approach, but again, I think as has been very clearly signaled by the Fed, the bar around dividend is higher than buyback, just based on the nature of what a dividend is. And so we\u2019ll have to take that into account.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">And then just briefly touching on the expense versus revenue, the way you\u2019re looking at that trailing 12 months, is that just because the composition is more fixed with salary and bonus versus variable expenses, so that over time you kind of work your way through the ups and downs of revenue and create traction and efficiencies, but you\u2019re not going to be able to move as quickly to the quarterly fluctuations?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">I\u2019d say that I still think that the best way to measure your efficiency is over time. And therefore, as you look at something over a trailing 12 month basis, you would have captured a full year of performance, and I really think that\u2019s the best way to judge how a firm is evidencing expense discipline.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">And I wouldn\u2019t disagree with that as much as I was trying to just get at is that just a difference in the way that the compensation is kind of set up now and structured, and looking at it over that time really is a better way to do that, because of the way the compensation is structured now?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">I think it\u2019s a matter of how compensation is structured between deferrals of incentive comp. Much more is deferred now and recognized over three or four years, and so a lot of the compensation expense that you have in a year actually relates to performance in other years, as well as the operating performance that you have in the current year. Plus, there\u2019s different methodologies that firms employ in how they accrue compensation expense, and when they accrue compensation expense. But when you get to year-end, you have to have the expenses accrued for that year\u2019s performance, in that year. So that\u2019s why I continue to think that at any given point in time, you really want to measure people on a trailing 12 month basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">And lastly, on page 38, you\u2019re showing the loan to value for mortgages in Citi Holdings, and you\u2019ve seen a marked improvement in those that have loan to values over 100%, to the point now that your reserves cover basically 100% of those balances when you start looking at those that have greater than 100% and FICOs less than 660. So when you\u2019re talking about home prices and the difference it makes, it does make a difference on this particular page, in that you\u2019re seeing migration into more stable and better-performing buckets. That would still be a positive you could see rolling forward, I would think.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">And you\u2019re absolutely correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Your next question comes from the line of Derek De Vries of UBS.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Derek De Vries - UBS </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">You just sort of opened the can of worms on deferred comp, and I\u2019m wondering if you could just help me understand it a little bit. As we get to the end of the compensation year within securities and banking, can you just give us the amount of, just broadly, in hundreds of millions or billions, or whatever, the amount that would be awarded but not yet expensed? That would help us understand the ability to flex down the cost there. So I was wondering if you could just give us the awarded but not yet expensed at the end of the compensation year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">I\u2019m not prepared to do that at this point in time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Derek De Vries - UBS </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">And then maybe just a slightly more generic question then. I\u2019m trying to sort of reconcile the comments you made in the beginning, the challenging and uneven operating environment, with more of an upbeat backdrop on loan growth, particularly in emerging markets. And just as we go forward, should we think about the kind of growth rates that you\u2019ve been able to deliver recently? Or do you see some things that make you think that could slow down a little?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">I would take a look at the overall environment and I do think that it does remain challenging. We have been able to grow loans in a challenging environment, although that loan growth has been a little bit less this year than it had been in years before. And even though you can continue to grow loans, then you have the other issue as far as spread compression. So you can continue to grow loans, but if you\u2019re growing loans at lower spreads, that not exactly going to be beneficial towards your revenue. So I think that you need to sort through how you think about both. I think we\u2019ve evidenced that we can certainly grow the volumes, but I think what you also see is that we have been impacted by a certain amount of spread compression, as have most other people in the industry.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">And as I think about it, there\u2019s two things in some ways in competition. I think as you look at growth estimates as we look forward for 2013, we\u2019ve seen, off of downward revisions in 2013 actually some uplifts in \u201914. But I think at the same point, when you go back and you look historically and you can look at several points of history, \u201994-95 certainly easily being one of those, any time in particular out of the U.S. you\u2019re transitioning into a higher rate environment, the EM economies don\u2019t come through that cleanly. I think in many ways today those economies are much better positioned to come through the shift towards higher rates, and whether that\u2019s a rise in foreign exchange reserves, whether that\u2019s floating exchange rate mechanisms, external liquidity, and you can go on and on through those. But again, I just think a transitioning U.S. interest rate is certainly going to have an impact on trading volumes, capital flows, new issuance calendars. And so I think we\u2019ve got to try and strike a balance between those things.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Your next question is coming from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">I won\u2019t beat up on the securities and banking efficiency ratio question, even though that\u2019s up 10 percentage points linked quarter. Let\u2019s turn to the other two businesses that are almost two-thirds of your revenues, GTS and global consumer banking. So following a little bit of your trail of thought, John, you\u2019re looking at it year to date. GTS efficiency ratios up from, I believe, 52% to 54%, and global consumer bank is up also from 53% to 54%. So even though you\u2019re more than halfway through your cost restructuring, your efficiency ratios are going the other direction. Can you talk to that a little bit, especially given your confidence about GTS for the second half?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">I think what you\u2019re going to see in transaction services - and I said it before - I think you\u2019ll start to see improvement beginning in the fourth quarter. And that improvement should begin to then roll forward through next year\u2019s results as well. And I have no doubt that transaction services will meet the efficiency targets that we set out for them for 2015. Consumer has been bumping around at, as you mentioned, 53-54% probably, if I look at it on a trailing 12 month basis, for the last five quarters maybe. But there\u2019s still work to go there. They have not fully completed the rollout of rainbow yet. And obviously we\u2019re still in the process of readjusting the mortgage business. So they\u2019ve got that running through the top line, and we haven\u2019t quite gotten the expenses out in mortgages yet. And the commitment was that we would get consumer to 47% to 50% by 2015. And so I still think that we\u2019re on track to do that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Even though so far you\u2019ve gone the other direction? You\u2019re over half [unintelligible] in \u201914. Okay, a couple of little ones. Private label, I just want to come back to that. Did you add anything for that in the third quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">There was a very small amount, because don\u2019t forget we only had the Best Buy\u2026</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">No, sorry, private label MBS. My apologies.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">I\u2019m sorry. When it comes to private label securitizations, I\u2019m not going to comment about any specific reserving in the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">And then turning to Best Buy, did you take on any delinquencies with that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Again, when it comes to the Best Buy, we did take on delinquencies. And so the delinquencies do end up in our statistics. It\u2019s just that, from a reserving point of view, we don\u2019t pick up loan loss reserves.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">And those are not marked down, the loan portfolios?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">The loan portfolios come on our books on a fair market value basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Your next question comes from the line of Adam Hurwich with Ulysses Management.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Adam Hurwich - Ulysses Management</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">I\u2019m referring to slide 21, 26, and slide 41. You\u2019ve managed to keep your risk-weighted assets pretty flat, actually declining, on a Basel III basis. And at the same time, you seem to be growing your regulatory capital currently at a $15 billion rate and rising. I\u2019m just wondering, how do we think about capital adequacy going forward? And given your capital build rate, at some point we need to think a little bit more holistically about what you do with that. Could you give us at least the basis to understand that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">You\u2019ve got a lot of questions wrapped up in there. Let me try to parse through a little bit of that, and you come back where I\u2019ve failed. From a capital build rate, certainly the capital is building as a result of the earnings, as well as the DTA. So this quarter, the earnings themselves were a lot of $3 billion, the DTA was a benefit of $500 million, then we also had a benefit of OCI, which of course from a Basel III basis ends up in that as well. So, over the course of the quarter, we actually built about $4.5 billion worth of regulatory capital from those three components. What we\u2019ve said is that our expectation is over time we would target running at a 10% Basel III ratio. Now, we need to think about how we may change that as the supplemental leverage ratio rules begin to finalize, but that\u2019s where we are right now. So what have I failed to answer?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Adam Hurwich - Ulysses Management </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">You didn\u2019t fail to answer anything. The only reason I\u2019m asking this is because there seems to be a lot of focus on GAAP numbers, but there\u2019s a large discrepancy between GAAP and regulatory capital measures. And there seems to be a benefit that you will accrue due to that differential. Am I missing anything, or in fact when regulators are comfortable with the bank, will we be able to see a benefit from the discrepancy?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">I think you\u2019re right. As a matter of fact, one of the things that we talk about is the fact that as we think about the strategies for our Citicorp businesses, we think that those Citicorp businesses operate in a very Basel III friendly way. We\u2019re focused on real high-level credit worthy customers in both the consumer businesses as well as in the corporate business, and we think we can run the business, as I say, in a very efficient manner under Basel III. It maybe referenced in one of the slides that we have in the appendix that shows the returns that we get on a Basel III basis. So that\u2019s where we\u2019re headed with the strategy. As far as how the regulators view us and what might be the future, again, we think that we\u2019re in fairly constructive dialogs with the regulators.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Your next question comes from Andrew Marquardt with Evercore.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">A couple of ticky-tack questions. Just to follow on that last question, in terms of capital, can you help us understand, is there a material difference in terms of tier one common Basel III under the standardized approach versus the advanced?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">There\u2019s a very large difference between the way those two calculations work, and under the terms of Dodd-Frank, what large banks in the U.S. are directed to do is report the lower of the two ratios. So currently we are reporting our ratios under the advanced approach.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Which is the lower of the two?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Yes, by definition. I couldn\u2019t report it if it wasn\u2019t.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">And then separately, you had mentioned, in terms of unfunded commitments, there was a reserve build, partly due to growth in commitments, as well as some risk migration downward. Can you help clarify exactly what was going on there in terms of risk migration?</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">In our commitments book, we took a look at some of the commitments we had to our clients, especially clients that are in countries where the country itself ends up being risk weighted lower. We therefore re-rate the company, and therefore ended up building a bit more reserves.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Should we expect continued build in unfunded commitment reserves? Or is this kind of a one-time adjustment?</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">I wouldn\u2019t call it a one-time adjustment, but it\u2019s another one of those episodic adjustments. I don\u2019t anticipate that level of migration repeating in the fourth quarter, but I can\u2019t tell you that it absolutely won\u2019t, either.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">And then lastly, just bigger picture, in terms of the margin on a consolidated basis. You had mentioned you expect it may be flattish in the fourth quarter. But then beyond that, is it fair to assume that there will be still kind of this gradual grind down in terms of the margin on a consolidated basis, given the global spread compression that you\u2019ve referenced?</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">I think as long as we stay in a low interest rate environment, you\u2019re going to have, as you put it, that grind down approach. I would think at some point in time we would begin to see some level of interest rate increase, and then you could get a bit of a benefit. Until then, it\u2019s going to be really a matter of how the calculus works out between your ability to grow loans and lower your cost of funding, how those two factors offset the impact of the continued spread compression.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">And lastly, just to wrap it kind of maybe back to the first question, on this long call, of kind of getting to your longer term ROA goal, what would be your view of a normalized interest margin over the cycle to get into that 90/110 ROA basis?</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">We didn\u2019t really talk about that at that point in time, and I don\u2019t really have a longer term NIM goal that I care to share at this point in time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Just one quick question on TSS. You indicated that the operating leverage, you\u2019re expecting second half to be positive. Can you just give us a sense as to is that versus first half, is that year on year, and the major drivers there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">It would be year on year. In other words, it would be the second half of 2013 compared to the second half of 2012.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">And the drivers?</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">The drivers would be revenue growth being larger than expense growth. I\u2019m only kidding, sorry.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">No, I get operating leverage. I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s really you\u2019re banking on it being more revenue related than expense related.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">No, actually I think you\u2019re going to see some good expense performance coming out of the fourth quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">And then in retail banking, ex the mortgage, on the revenue margins there, got the message that it was competitive environment and you need to be competitive to get the volume growth. That\u2019s been a trend over the past couple of quarters. So we should continue to expect that going forward? I\u2019m just asking for some color from the field as to how you\u2019re thinking about it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">On mortgage revenues in particular?</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">No, excluding mortgage revenues. So, retail banking margins are down. Excluding mortgage related.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">I think you\u2019re still going to see some pressure in retail banking, just due to, again, that low interest rate environment, and the impact there for that low interest rate on the deposit taking business that we have in the retail bank. <strong> </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">At this time, we have reached our allotted time for questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Susan Kendall</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">Thanks, operator, and thank you all for joining us here today.

Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today.

Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Mike Corbat, will speak first. Then John Gerspach, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we\u2019ll be happy to take your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Before we get started, I\u2019d like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results in capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2012 Form 10-K.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you, Susan. Good morning everyone. Earlier today, we reported earnings of $2.7 billion for the fourth quarter, excluding CVA and DVA and the impact of the credicard divestiture, net income was $2.6 billion, or $0.82 a share.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">In our institutional business, our fourth quarter markets performance reflected an ongoing challenging environment sequentially while our rates and currencies revenues were relatively stable, our credit and securitized products revenues were lower due to reduced client activity. And while on equities, client flows were relatively stable, we underperformed in trading.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">In contrast, investment banking showed positive momentum during the quarter driven by strong M&amp;A and equity underwriting and we increased our overall wallet share for the year. Transactions services products demonstrated resilience in the low interest rate environment and regain positive operating leverage for the second half of the year. Importantly we continue to grow both our client volumes and market share, while demonstrating strong fee revenue growth on a year-on-year basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Our consumer bank performed well internationally with Latin America showing continued revenue growth. The ongoing efforts to reposition our franchise in Korea continue to impact our Asian results, but the region had good performance otherwise. Our U.S business saw revenue boost from the acquisition of the Best Buy portfolio. We saw positive drivers in our Citi branded cards business and mortgage revenues broadly stabilized during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">For the full year 2013 with every bit as challenging as we thought it would be when we entered the year. Low interest rates, changing expectations regarding the tapering of quantitative easing, the increase in cost of legal settlements, all had significant impacts on our bottom line.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">However, while we didn\u2019t finish 2013 as strongly as I would have liked, very pleased with the progress we made over the course of the year, especially in regard to several critical areas I highlighted in my first earnings call with you last January.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">As a Company we improved our efficiency, completing the repositioning effort we announced last December. We\u2019ve reduced our operating expenses by 2% and our headcount by 3% in 2013, while exiting segments that didn\u2019t fit our strategy. Key metrics such as ROTCE and ROA also improved as we made progress towards the targets we announced in March. We also began to tap into our deferred tax asset with $600 million of DTA utilized in the fourth quarter, which brought the total amount utilized to $2.4 billion for the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Turning to Citi Holdings with a $39 billion reduction in assets, we shrunk its size by 25% in 2013. We narrowed its annual loss by half when compared to 2012 making good progress for getting to breakeven. We also managed to put several legacy issues behind this through settlements with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">By focusing intently on our clients, we grew loans in Citicorp by 7% over 2012 and improved our market share across our institutional businesses. And our net income of $13.8 billion was 15% above 2012 and the highest since before the financial crisis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Higher net income help to accelerate the growth of capital during the year and we exceeded our goal of ending 2013 with an estimated Basel III Tier 1 common ratio of 10% by 50 basis points. We also received no objection to the capital plan we submitted to our regulators in early 2013, in addition our supplementary leverage ratio increased to an estimated 5.4% exceeding the regulatory requirement.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">But being pleased with our progress doesn\u2019t make us satisfied and I know our shareholders aren\u2019t either. We still have work to do to generate the results that our shareholders expect and reserve -- deserve.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Looking to 2014, we expect to be tested again as we believe the environment while improving will remain challenging. We believe short-term interest rates will remain low for the foreseeable future and although we are working hard to put the remaining legacy issues behind us, legal headwinds will remain with us and the industry.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">And while we do see an improving economic environment, growth won\u2019t be robust really by any means. We believe the deceleration of growth in Asia has bottomed out and the euro zone is continuing to recover that albeit slowly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Our projections for key markets such as Mexico, India and Korea call for improvements over 2013 levels. In the U.S we believe our mortgage revenues have stabilized and we are working to reduce the costs associated with legacy assets in Citi Holdings as the recently announced sale of certain mortgage servicing rights shows.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We\u2019ve entered 2014 as a strong and stable institution as we work to leverage our unparallel global network to the benefit of our clients. We are completely focused on executing our strategy and remain committed to the targets we announced last year as well as our objective of returning capital to our shareholders.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">With that, I will now turn it over to John and he can go through the deck and then we\u2019d be happy to answer your questions. John?</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Thank you, Mike, and good morning everyone. To start, I\u2019d like to highlight some significant items affecting our results this quarter. First, CVA and DVA were negative $164 million pre-tax and $100 million after tax in the fourth quarter, for a negative impact on EPS of $0.03 per share.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We also recorded an after tax benefit of $189 million related to the Credicard divestiture this quarter for a positive impact on EPS of $0.06 per share. For comparison purposes, in the fourth quarter of 2012, CVA and DVA were negative $485 million pre-tax or $301 million after tax for a negative impact of $0.10 per share.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In addition, last year we recorded a large repositioning charge of over $1 billion pre-tax or $653 million after tax which had a negative impact on EPS of $0.21 per share. Given the size of the repositioning charge in the fourth quarter of 2012, I will be discussing our results today excluding this item. However, we have continued to incur small repositioning charges as part of our ongoing expense initiatives, and these charges are included in our expense numbers for 2013.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Adjusting for CVA, DVA and the impact of the credicard divestiture and the fourth quarter 2012 repositioning charges, we earned $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2013 or $0.82 per share as compared to $0.69 per share in the fourth quarter of 2012.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On Slide 4 we show total Citigroup results. We earned 2.6 billion in the fourth quarter, up over 20% from last year, as lower operating expenses and lower credit cards were partially offset by a decline in revenues and a higher effective tax rate.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">The effective tax rate was 32% for the fourth quarter of 2013, somewhat above the prior quarter and full year tax rate, primarily due to the amount of legal accruals estimated to be nondeductible.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On a full year basis, revenues grew 1% while operating expenses were 2% lower and credit cards also declined by over 2.8 billion, driving earnings growth of 15%. Citigroup end of period loans grew 2% year-over-year to 668 billion, as 7% growth in Citicorp was partially offset by the continued decline in Citi Holdings, and deposits grew to $968 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On Slide 5 we provide more detail on fourth quarter revenues in constant dollars. In consumer banking, revenues grew by over $200 million, sequentially, driven by the Best Buy portfolio acquisition and continued growth in Latin America, and year-over-year the decline mostly reflected lower U.S. mortgage refinancing activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Securities and banking revenues declined by over $450 million, sequentially, reflecting lower markets revenues, partially offset by growth in investment banking. And year-over-year, fixed income revenues were down, however both equities and investment banking showed improvement.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In transaction services, revenues have been fairly stable as growth in volumes and fees continued to be offset by lower spreads. Citi Holdings revenues improved year-over-year mostly reflecting the absence of rep and warranty reserve builds. Finally, foreign currency translation accounted for roughly $260 million of the reported revenue decline year-over-year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On Slide 6 we show more expense details. Core operating expenses of 10.9 billion in the fourth quarter declined by roughly 340 million year-over-year in constant dollars, driven by efficiency savings and a decline in Citi Holdings assets, partially offset by volume-related expenses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Sequentially, costs were down by roughly $50 million reflecting additional repositioning savings, partially offset by seasonal marketing expenses, deal-related costs in securities and banking and higher than anticipated expenses in retail services in the quarter related to the integration of the Best Buy portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Legal and related costs were just over $800 million in the fourth quarter, and as we had disclosed previously repositioning costs were somewhat higher than recent quarters at $234 million. In addition, we incurred an incremental $33 million of compensatory fees to Fannie Mae related to the sale of servicing rights out of Citi Holdings we announced yesterday.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On a full year basis, core operating expenses of 44.3 billion in 2013 declined by nearly $900 million, driven by firm wide efficiency savings and asset reductions in Citi Holdings, partially offset by volume-related growth and investments in Citicorp, as well as higher regulatory-related expenses. However, legal and related expenses continued to be elevated at roughly $3 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On Slide 7, we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. In Citicorp, pre-tax earnings grew 4% year-over-year in the fourth quarter as a decline in revenues was more than offset by lower operating expenses and an improvement in credit. And on a full year basis, pre-tax earnings improved by 5% with revenues roughly flat and expenses down by 4%, partially offset by lower loan loss reserve releases versus the prior year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to Citi Holdings, revenues were 1.3 billion in the fourth quarter and the net loss was roughly 400 million. For the full year, Citi Holdings losses declined by nearly half from $3.7 billion last year to $1.9 billion in 2013, driven by a significant improvement in credit and declining assets partially offset by higher legal and related costs. Citi Holdings assets declined by 25% during the year to 117 billion or 6% of total Citigroup assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to Citicorp on Slide 8, we show results for international consumer banking again in constant dollars. On this basis, revenues grew 2% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, while expenses increased by 3%, driven entirely by repositioning charges of roughly $80 million. International consumer revenues continued to reflect spread compression as well as the impact of regulatory changes and the repositioning of our franchise in certain markets, particularly Korea.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">However, most key drivers remain positive with both average loans and card purchase sales up 6% from last year. On a full year basis, revenues increased by 3% driven by Latin America, while expenses grew 1% resulting in positive operating leverage. Credit cards increased in 2013, however, the NCL rate remains stable and loan loss reserve builds were mostly driven by portfolio growth, as well as specific builds for Mexico homebuilders during the year, as we have previously discussed.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On Slide 9, we show revenue details for Asia consumer. Lower retail banking revenues in the fourth quarter reflected the continued impact of regulatory changes, spread compression and the repositioning of our franchise in Korea. Investment sales revenues remain muted in fourth quarter, in line with investor sentiment. And cards revenues improved slightly both year-over-year and sequentially with continued growth in purchase sales across the region.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Korea remains a headwind, however, we continue to believe revenues in Korea should begin to stabilize in early 2014. Importantly, credit trends have remained stable in Korea and Korea's drag on year-over-year loan growth for total Asia has diminished in recent quarters. Over time, Korea should better reflect our consumer franchise elsewhere around the world with a footprint more concentrated in the major cities, a focus on high quality consumer segments and improved returns.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Slide 10 shows the results for North America consumer banking. Total revenues were down 8% year-over-year and grew 3% sequentially. Retail banking revenues of 1.1 billion declined by 35% from last year, mostly reflecting the lower mortgage refinancing activity. Sequentially, mortgage revenues have begun to stabilize but we'll continue to present a drag on year-over-year comparisons though at least the first half of 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Branded cards revenues of 2.1 billion were flat versus last year and up 2% from last quarter, driven by continued improvement in net interest spreads and growth in purchase sales, offsetting the impact of lower average loans. Retail services grew 9% versus the prior quarter and prior year, driven by the Best Buy portfolio acquisition. Average loans grew 18% year-over-year, however, spreads declined as promotional balances increased.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Total operating expenses of 2.4 billion were down 6% year-over-year, reflecting lower legal and related costs, ongoing efficiency savings and the resizing of the mortgage business, partially offset by the impact of the Best Buy acquisition. Credit cost declined modestly year-over-year but grew 19% sequentially driven by lower reserve releases in branded cards and the impact of Best Buy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Overall our North America business executed well in 2013 in the phase of many significant changes, from the resizing of our mortgage business to the continued revitalization of the branded cards franchise and the Best Buy portfolio acquisition, and we continued to see momentum in the fourth quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Average deposits were up 5%, commercial market loans grew by 10% and purchase sale growth improved in branded cards reflecting the impact of investments in that business as well as an acceleration of growth in the American Airlines portfolio since the merger with US Airways was approved.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We are pleased that we were recently awarded exclusive rights to issue new credit card accounts in support of American Airlines following the planned merger of the American and US Airways frequent flyer programs by mid 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Slide 11 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail. Credit remained favorable in North America in the fourth quarter. With the decline in the NCL rate reflecting both underlying improvement as well as the impact of the Best Buy portfolio which was acquired late in the third quarter. Looking forward we currently anticipate the NCL rate in North America to be in the range of 3% for full-year 2014 as new loans continued to season in the Best Buy portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">In Asia, credit trends remain stable in the fourth quarter, and in Latin America we saw an uptick in both NCL and delinquency rates. The higher NCL rate in the fourth quarter primarily reflected the impact of portfolio seasoning in Mexico. Looking to full-year 2014, we currently expect this portfolio seasoning to continue with the NCL rate in Latin America being broadly in the range of the levels we saw in the second half of 2013. However the NCL rate maybe somewhat higher in the first quarter as we typically see a seasonal decline in card loan balances.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">In addition, as we have said previously we took loan loss reserves in 2013 related to our exposure to Mexican home builders as well as the hurricanes in Mexico in the third quarter. Any losses from the home builders or the impact from the hurricanes may increase our NCL rate in the current quarters. However we would expect these losses to be charged against the reserve and therefore they should be neutral to the overall cost of credit. The increase in the delinquency rate in the fourth quarter was mostly driven by our exposure to home builders in Mexico.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Slide 12 shows our securities and banking business. Revenues of $4.6 billion declined 5% from last year and 9% sequentially. Investment banking revenues of $1 billion were up 3% from the prior year and 23% from last quarter, driven by M&amp;A and equity underwriting partially offset by lower debt underwriting revenues. Full-year investment banking revenues of $4 billion grew by 8% as we continued to gain overall wallet share.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Equity market revenues of $539 million in the fourth quarter were up 16% from last year, reflecting improved client activity in both cash and derivatives. Sequentially, equity market revenues declined 24% as trading performance was weaker and client activity slowed somewhat in December. However we still made significant progress in a full year basis with equity market revenues up 22% reflecting market share gains, improvements in derivatives execution and a more favorable environment. Fixed income market revenues of $2.3 billion in the fourth quarter declined 15% from last year and 16% sequentially.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Overall trading conditions remained muted for fixed income as the government shutdown in the early weeks of the quarter as well as continued speculation around the timing of fed tapering resulted in an environment similar to the third quarter where it was more difficult to generate incremental trading revenues on client flows. In addition, both the year-over-year and sequential decline reflected the absence of any significant revenues from our Citi Capital Advisors business which we continued to wind down. This business was not a material revenue contributor historically but did have a strong fourth quarter in 2012.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">And finally while our rates in currencies business showed resilience in the fourth quarter with revenues down only slightly from the third quarter we did see a decline in spread products, particularly in securitized products. For the full-year fixed income market revenues of $13 billion declined by 7%. Our full-year results reflected market share gains across most products including strong performance in credit and securitized products.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">However, we saw fewer market opportunities in rates and currencies. Private bank revenues of $599 million were up slightly from last year and down 2% sequentially driven by lower capital markets activity. Lending revenues excluding the impact of gains and losses on hedges related to accrual loans were $393 million in the fourth quarter up from prior periods as higher volumes and lower losses from loan sale activity were partially offset by lower spreads.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Total operating expenses of $3.4 billion were down versus the prior-year driven by lower compensation expenses partially offset by higher legal and related costs and repositioning charges in the recent quarter. On a sequential basis expenses were flat as lower compensation expenses were offset by higher deal related and legal-end related costs as well as the impact of foreign exchange. On a full-year basis the franchise continued to show momentum with revenues up 4% driven by equities, investment banking and our private bank while expenses declined by 3% resulting in 16% growth in pre-tax earnings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Moving to transaction services on Slide 13, revenues of $2.6 billion were up 1% from last year in constant dollars as strong fee income growth more than offset a decline in net interest revenues. Treasury and trade solutions was flat year-over-year as volume in fee growth was offset by the continued impact of spread compression globally, and securities and fund services revenues were up 5% as higher settlement volumes and fees more than offset lower spreads. Client activity grew across the franchise.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Trade loan originations were up 12% year-over-year, average deposits grew 9%, assets under custody were up 10% and SFS settlement volumes grew by 15%. Despite these volume gains expenses of $1.4 billion declined 3% year-over-year in constant dollars driven by efficiency savings as well as lower and legal related costs. Given the modest revenue growth in expense decline in the fourth quarter transaction services achieved positive operating leverage for the second half of 2013.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On Slide 14 we show expense and efficiency trends for the total institutional franchise. On a trailing 12 month basis, we have lowered our operating expenses every quarter for the past two years driving the total efficiency ratio from 67% in 2011 to 58% in 2013. Compensation has been a significant contributor with the comp ratio for the total institutional franchise improving to 29% in 2013.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">In securities and banking we have reduced the annual cost base by $1 billion since 2011, and while we have additional work to do on a full-year basis for 2013 our efficiency ratio in securities and banking was 59% within our 2015 target range of 55% to 60%. And in transaction services the efficiency ratio was 54% somewhat above our 48% to 52% target.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">However as you can see here we have been able to keep expenses flat at $5.7 billion even as we have gained market share and built significant volumes. This should position us well for margin expansion in the future as we look to continue increasing the C component of our revenues as spreads stabilize and we begin to see the cost savings from repositioning actions taken in 2013.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Slide 15 shows the results for corporate other. Revenues were up versus the prior year mainly driven by hedging activities partially offset by lower AFS sales while expenses declined, mostly reflecting lower legal and related costs. Assets of 314 billion included approximately 116 billion of cash and cash equivalents and 141 billion of liquid available for sale securities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Slide 16 shows Citi Holdings assets. We ended the quarter with assets of 117 billion in Citi Holdings or 6% of total Citigroup assets. The $5 billion reduction in the fourth quarter reflected $4 billion of net pay downs and $1 billion of asset sales. These sales included roughly 400 million of North America mortgages most of which were non-performing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">On Slide 17 we show Citi Holdings financial results for the quarter. Total revenues of 1.3 billion were up year-over-year, primarily driven by the absence of rep and warranty reserve builds this quarter. Citi Holdings expenses decreased 4% year-over-year to 1.5 billion, driven by the decline in assets partially offset by higher legal and related costs. Excluding legal costs, operating expenses declined 16% to roughly 825 million while with North America mortgages comprising over a third of these operating expenses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">As I mentioned earlier, yesterday we announced the sale of mortgage servicing rights for loans with a balance of roughly $10 billion. While this is only about 10% of our third party servicing portfolio in Citi Holdings, the sale includes the majority of the delinquent loans we serviced for Fannie Mae, and it represents nearly 20% of the total loans currently serviced by Citi mortgage that are 60 days or more past due. This sale should benefit our mortgage expenses in Citi Holdings beginning in the second quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Net credit losses continued to improved year-over-year and we released 540 million of loans loss reserves, substantially all of which was related to North America mortgages. Mortgage net credit losses in the fourth quarter included 184 million of incremental charge-offs related to three items.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">First, a change in charge-off policy for mortgages originated in Citi financial to more closely aligned to policies used in the Citi mortgage business. Second, the acceleration of accounting losses associated with modified home equity loans determined to be collateral dependent. And third, a change in the estimate of net credit losses related to collateral dependent loans to borrowers that have gone through Chapter 7 bankruptcy. These incremental charge-offs were almost fully offset by related loan loss reserve releases during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Looking at the past five quarters of Citi Holdings results on Slide 18, excluding legal and related expenses the operating margin in Citi Holdings was positive again this quarter, while credit costs continued to improve. The pre-tax loss in Citi Holdings was roughly 500 million, driven by 647 million of legal and related expenses. Legal and related costs remained elevated during 2013, driven largely by legacy private label securitization and other mortgage related issues. It remains difficult for us to determine the ultimate timing and cost of resolving these issues. However, as we've said previously, we are hopeful we will have better clarity by sometime this year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">On Slide 19, we show North America mortgage trends in Citi Holdings. We ended the quarter with $73 billion of North America mortgages, down 20% from a year ago, while net credit losses declined by 50% and the loss rate improved by roughly 120 basis points. Here, we show the breakdown of residential first mortgages originated in Citi mortgage versus the legacy Citi financial business. As you can see, while loan balances and net credit losses are declining in both portfolios, the loans originated in Citi financial are becoming a larger proportion of the total.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Given the borrower profile in Citi financial, these loans tend to have higher loss rates at around 5% versus the loss rate of around 1% for Citi mortgage first mortgages. We ended the quarter with 4.9 billion of loan loss reserves allocated to North America mortgages and Citi Holdings or 39 months of NCL coverage. Looking at 2014, assuming the U.S. economic environment remains favorable, we continue to expect to utilize loan loss reserves to offset a substantial portion of our mortgage net credit losses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">On Slide 20 we show Citigroup's net interest revenue and margin trends. Net interest revenue grew to $12 billion in the fourth quarter, driven by growth in average interest earning assets and a sequential improvement in margin. Our net interest margin grew by 7 basis points in the fourth quarter, reflecting lower funding costs as well as stable loan and investment yields. We currently expect our net interest margin in 2014 should be at or around the 285 basis points we achieved in 2013 with fluctuations quarter-to-quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">On Slide 21 we show our key capital metrics. Quarter-over-quarter, our estimated Basel III Tier 1 common ratio remained roughly flat at 10.5%, as our Tier 1 common capital continued to grow driven by retained earnings and DTA utilization, but our risk-weighted assets also increased by approximately $40 billion. Our DTA utilization this quarter was roughly $600 million bringing our total utilization for the year to roughly 2.4 billion, approximately 2 billion of which was comprised of foreign tax credit carryforwards.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">The increase in risk-weighted assets quarter-over-quarter is entirely driven by an increase in our estimated risk-weighted assets associated with operational risks. We continued to further refine and enhance our models under Basel III and given the evolving regulatory and litigation environment, we felt it prudent to increase our operational risks RWA during the quarter. Any changes to operational risks RWA, however, do not have an impact with calculating our estimated Basel III supplementary leverage ratio which increased to 5.4% in the fourth quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">As we continue to move towards full Basel III implementation, we expect there could be additional refinements or required enhancements to our Basel III models as well as further regulatory implementation guidance. In addition, our Basel III modeled remained subject to regulatory review and approval. Any such changes or requirements could result in additional increases in our risk-weighted assets or changes to other elements involved in the calculation of our Basel III ratios.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">In summary, we clearly faced a difficult environment in the fourth quarter with continued challenging trading conditions and low interest rates. However, against this backdrop we did make progress on several fronts. Investment banking revenues were strong driven by M&amp;A and equity underwriting. Our consumer business returned to growth quarter-over-quarter driven by Latin America and the Best Buy portfolio acquisition.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">In Citi Holdings, we continued to drive towards breakeven and we ended the year with a strong capital position at an estimated Basel III Tier 1 common ratio of 10.5% and a supplementary leverage ratio of 5.4%. On a full year basis we improved on each of our key financial targets with better operating efficiency in Citicorp and higher Citigroup returns on both assets and tangible common equity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Looking forward to 2014, in consumer we expect the low interest rate environment to continue. However, some of the headwinds that affected us in 2013 should abate as we go through the year. In the U.S., we believe that mortgage revenues have broadly stabilized, while the impact of capacity reductions will result in lower expenses. Branded cards is beginning to show visible improvement and we will benefit from a full year of Best Buy revenues. And for international, we believe revenues in Korea should begin to stabilize early this year alleviating the drag on Asia while Latin America should continue to grow.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Our securities and banking results will likely continue to reflect the overall market environment with a goal of steadily gaining wallet share over time with our target clients. And in transaction services we expect continued volume in fee growth to help offset the ongoing pressure of the low rate environment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Turning to expenses, core operating expenses excluding legal and related as well as repositioning costs were roughly $44.3 billion for full year 2013. Looking forward our goal is to continue improving Citicorp efficiency while winding down the assets and expenses in Citi Holdings. Our core operating expenses will vary with the revenue environment, but as an example looking at a low single-digit revenue growth scenario in Citicorp.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">We would expect our core operating expenses in 2014 to come in at or somewhat below the level of 2013 as continued productivity efforts offset by volume related growth investments going to continue to increase in regulatory related expenses. And of course there would be variability quarter-to-quarter, particularly driven by our markets businesses. Repositioning expenses are expected to remain elevated in the first half of 2014 roughly in line with the levels we incurred in the fourth quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Finally, legal expenses which totaled approximately $3 billion for full year 2013 are expected to remain elevated into 2014. In this environment we remain focused on execution. Gaining share with our clients, improving our efficiency, maintaining our credit discipline and winding down Citi Holdings in an economically rationale manner.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And with that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p9\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Hi. I was wondering about if you could discuss the roadmap to the 2015 financial targets? On the efficiency side of the targets, can you remind us of the levers that you can pull to get the Citicorp to the mid 50 efficiency ratio because when we include the repositioning expenses it just doesn\u2019t feel like we\u2019re experiencing major progress on the core expenses? So you mentioned ICG is largely there John, may be you could talk about where the -- what can you do to get these efficiency targets in \u201915?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Well, we did make progress on those efficiency targets in \u201913. As I said, when you take a look at the overall efficiency target that we set was going to be in the mid 50%, on the mid 50s. We came down to 58% for Citicorp during 2013 and as I said -- I didn\u2019t say that ICG is largely there John, I meant to say if I didn\u2019t say that securities and banking is at least within the range right now, but we do still have more work to do. In transaction services, we\u2019ve been investing in that business and we haven\u2019t had as much repositioning effort necessarily in transaction services as we did in securities and banking during 2013. So I still think that there are things that we can do there, there are levers that we can pull as you put it going in to 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And finally on consumer, consumer is the one where we didn\u2019t make at least on the reported numbers; we didn\u2019t necessarily make progress during 2013. Consumer is at about 54% efficiency ratio for both 2013 and 2012. There we think that as we begin to get more of a rollout of our drive to common efforts rolling our rainbow and standardizing the platforms for the retail banking and cards businesses. We think then that\u2019s really going to begin to see some more efficiency improvements in consumer. So that is something that you should continue to see, you should start to see in 2014 and then continue into 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Could you remind us on these repositioning expenses, what are the nature of these and why are they persisting at such a high rate? I think you indicated they might stay in the $250 million range for the first half of the year and then you expect them to come down?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes, let\u2019s just -- I mean the first half of the year we still think is going to be elevated and when you take a look at what we anticipate, we still needing to do in the first half of the year. We still are looking to reduce our global real estate footprint. We still have facilities that are just larger than we currently need based upon how we\u2019ve been able to reduce headcount and there is still facilities, there is leases that we need to exit. Part of the issue when it comes to real estate John is we can\u2019t just book reserves in advance of exiting the premises. Your reserve has to be taken after or in the same period that you\u2019ve actually left the building and so there would be more of that. We are still in the process of rationalizing our branch network in the U.S. You\u2019ve seen some of the announcements that we\u2019ve made regarding branches in Texas and elsewhere. Again, we can make announcements that we\u2019re closing down the branches, but the repositioning expenses to get out of those branches only happen when we\u2019ve actually left the premises. And as I mentioned as we rollout rainbow and we move towards standard platforms in consumer, certainly throughout 2014 there is going to be repositioning cost that we take as we continue to streamline the operations. It\u2019s not just about moving on to standard platforms. Now once we move on to standard platforms you want to standardize your processes around -- across the globe. And so that is going to incur some level of repositioning as we move forward. And then we will continue to look at delayering and rational -- rationalization of management structure throughout our businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">When you talk about getting to the efficiency targets in 2015, that includes repositioning expenses, right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes. When we\u2019ve given you the targets for 2015, they have been all inclusive.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And on the ROA and ROE side of the targets, the 1% ROA or average and the ROE of 10%, those goals for 2015, what are the drivers there? Are you relying on a -- I hope that the legal costs come down to get you there or what else can help you get to that \u2013 those profitability goals?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Well, don\u2019t forget as we continue to improve the efficiency that should improve results in Citicorp and the biggest driving -- one of the big driving factors that I think we\u2019ve mentioned is don\u2019t forget those goals that we laid out for ROA and ROTCE were at the Citigroup level. And so we continue to look to drive Citi Holdings close to breakeven.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. And one other question John on net interest income you mentioned that the margin outlook for the year of flattish at the 285 of \u201913, but you ended the year at higher than that and you added Best Buy in the fourth quarter, just kind of thinking about net interest income dollars, was there anything one time-ish about that strong $12 billion NII number that you\u2019re exiting the year at and is there any reason that\u2019s not a good starting point to try to grow off this year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">No John I\u2019m a little cautious always when it comes to trying to forecast out NIM. There is a component of NIM that gets impacted by our trading business and that can have some variability in it. So I think by -- if you think about where we started this year, my guidance coming into this year was that I expected NIM to be at or around the 282 that we had for overall 2012. We actually finished little higher at 285. I feel pretty comfortable just then establishing the fact that we will try to keep it constant going in to next year. But obviously if loan yields can improve a bit and if we can continue to lower the cost of our funding profile, there could be some upside to that number. But let\u2019s leave it at our expectations being at or around the 285 for now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I was really thinking about the dollars John, your full year NII dollars was 46.8, you ended the year with a $12 billion quarter and you have Best Buy now. So any reason on a dollar basis that NII wouldn\u2019t be higher in '14 versus '13 with the Best Buy portfolio?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">No, you're absolutely right. The NII dollars should continue to be there, but again when it looks at NIM, you have to take that over your average earning assets. And so right now we're saying NIM would stay about flat. But the NII should be \u2013 there's no reason to think that it's going to decline from where we were in 2013.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Right, the 12 going into this quarter is a good starting off point on dollars, it seems like that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">It's a good starting off point, John, but there's always likely to be some variability and don't forget when you get into things like NII, you get impacted by day count and everything else. So, certainly as you look towards the first quarter, just the way the calendar works, there happen to be two less days in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. So you can look at the fourth quarter 12 billion, but that's 92 days and there aren't 92 days in the first quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Got it, thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with ISI. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thanks. So I want to ask a big picture question about securities and banking and it goes towards John's question towards building, towards those 15 targets. And I guess the first part of it is if you think there's seasonality component that's heavily weighted in the first half, because if you look at your progression, it's there. So when you look at fourth quarter, it looks like you underperformed peer group. When you look at the full year, your revenues are in line, your expenses are down and you should be happy. But the problem is, is getting from current earnings to what people need to see to hit your targets in '15, this is my words, I think the investment bank is a huge contributor on whether or not you get there, so I'm curious to see if a, you think there is a big seasonality that we should be expecting and b, what specifically at the IB is going to help us drive towards those targets now that you're doing your job on the expense side or so it seems?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes, I'm going to turn it over to Mike but when you talk about seasonality, there is certainly some seasonality involved but I think you have to take a look at a big change in environment that happened first half versus second half this year. When we started out, it was a much more positive environment and then the second half as we got into the whole concept of said tapering, government slowdown, that changed the environment. It made it a much more cautious environment in the second half of the year, and certainly beginning in the third quarter and that certainly contributed, I think, a lot to what we saw as far as revenue production in the third and fourth quarter. Mike?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes, I agree with that. I think, Glenn, when you look at the year and as we go through our numbers, I think you've kind of looked that you can't just take a quarter like the fourth quarter, you can't take a quarter like the first quarter and simply annualize. I think you've got to look at the environment and I think as we look at the second half of the year, probably really starting in some ways with Bernanke's May 22nd talk and then through the summer on EM concerns and then as we entered the end of the third quarter and went into the fourth quarter in terms of government shutdown, we had a number of factors that we had to deal with in there. As I look at our S&amp;P franchise and in particular as I look at our fixed income businesses, there's nothing in here that causes me concern in terms of our positioning. I think that we're going to through a transitioning policy environment, through a transitioning rate environment, my guess is we'll have better quarters, we'll have less good quarters but our goal over the longer term is to continue to take market share. And again I think when you look at our full year we've done that. Clearly we didn't do that when we isolate the fourth quarter. I think when you look at our path to the targets that in spite of the environment we're in, we did grow revenues 4% across S&amp;P and I think that while you could have a more challenging parts of fixed income environment, I think you've seen the work in the investment that we've put in, in the investment bank starting to pay. I think you can see that some of the work we've done around equities starting to pay, but I think in each of those we've got more to do. But I think from that through being focused on market share gains, expensed disciplines, I think we've got the ability to continue to grow bottom line in that business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">All right, just one follow-up on S&amp;P. You've mentioned the 4% revenue growth in that environment, Mike, and I hear you on change in environment. Can you talk about comp specifically because there's a big piece of expenses and you guys disclosed differently or should I say don't disclose comp ratio and comp dollars, just given the improvement and efficiencies, just curious on how people should be thinking about if environment does get a little bit better, the operating leverage in S&amp;P?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Glenn, let me pipe in for a second. The efficiency ratio in ICG, as we said, has been steadily coming down. And what I thought I mentioned during my \u2013 running through this slide is that compensation definitely played a role there. And when you take a look at ICG, we actually had a comp ratio of 29% for 2013.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And what was that last year, in '12 just so we have the comparisons?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">It's down from last year. Again, this is the first time we've disclosed it, so let's just establish the fact that it's at 29%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay, I appreciate that. The comment on Korea caught my attention. Correct me if I'm wrong it sounded like a little bit better timing wise in terms of when that might flatten out and improve. Is that correct and does that make much of a difference on the P&amp;L because it's obviously being weighing down the rest of Asia which has been fine?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I'd say it's more a firming of the timeline. When we mentioned at the end, back in October that it should stabilize sometime in early 2014, it sounds like it's six months away. I think now when you hear it and you're sitting in January, it's something that could happen within the next three months. So it's certainly \u2013 we have reaffirmed, I think, the guidance that we gave you last year as far as our belief that those Korean revenues should stabilize. And we think that's going to have an impact on the overall growth trend in Asia. If you go back, Glenn, to the beginning of 2012, at the point in time, Korea \u2013 consumer loans in Korea represented 34% or so of the loans that we have in the Asia consumer franchise. Since that time we've been reducing the loans in Korea, Korea loans have come down about $5 billion during those ensuing eight quarters while you've seen the loan growth that we've had in Asia and that's now all because of the loan growth that we're getting out of Hong Kong, out of Singapore, out of India. So, we're getting loan growth and so now Korea loans represent something like 27% of the loans that we have in our Asia consumer franchise. And the reductions \u2013 the sequential reductions in the Korea loan book have begun to slow and so we see the revenue stabilizing early in 2014 and then you should get a much better view then as far as the underlying growth that we're actually generating in some of those other geographies, those other countries in Asia.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. Last one, I appreciate that John. The Springleaf IPO that's similar to something that you got inside Holdings and I know you've been asked questions on this in the past, but now that it's public, now that the stock has done well, does that mean there's a potentially better funding environment to do something strategic there whether it be sale partnership or IPO in a similar manner?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Glenn, we've been \u2013 as you may know we've been pretty closely involved with Springleaf in terms of helping them go out and raise funding as well as being a lead in terms of the IPO, so I think we've got a pretty good sense of that. And I think it goes back to what we've talked about that when we think the environment's right such that we can be paid value for that business, it's a business that is a terrific business but it's a business that's non-core to really what Citi is. So we're continuing to explore options with that business and when the time is right we're certainly going to be prepared to move on it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay, appreciate the answers. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Hi, guys.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Hi, Matt.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Just drilling down the expense outlook of flat to down, can you give us a sense of how much savings are still to come from the various repositioning that you've done, then how much might be just kind of natural expense creep and if there's a component that's discretionary in terms of investment spend? Or if that's not the right way to think about it, how should we kind of think about the components?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Well the only savings that we\u2019ve actually talked about, by the way we\u2019ve talked publicly about is specially linked to the repositioning was the $1 billion charge that we took in the fourth quarter of last year and we said that the anticipation was that, that would generate savings of about $1.2 billion annually, $900 million or so in 2013 with an annual run rate of $1.2 billion and we\u2019ve hit that. So you\u2019ve got that in the numbers. The rest of the repositioning action that we\u2019ve taken when we\u2019ve showed you at least the amounts that we\u2019ve done, there had been much smaller actions as we have gone through the year other than the fourth quarter where we went up to $234 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I think the average run rate for the other three quarters was something in the $100 million to $115 million range. But it's all these types of actions that I laid out as far as the types of things that we\u2019d be looking to do in 2014 it's de-layering of -- it's taking our management layers, it's repositioning the branch footprint et cetera, et cetera and all of those things are contributing to the expense base -- the overall expense base.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">We have had some as you\u2019d put it expense creep. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily refer to it as creep, but we do continue to invest in expanding our marketing programs of expenses associated with new product launches and development. So all of that we would think about as being investment spending as far as going into -- which will eventually yield to growth in revenues.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So we have, I think at a going forward basis the expectation would be that as long as we\u2019re in a -- as we would say a low single digit revenue growth environment we\u2019re going to continue to make some investments to achieve that revenue growth, but overall the impact of the repositioning actions should offset the cost of those investments. On top of that we haven't really spelled this out in any great degree of specificity but we have had and have been absorbing higher amounts of regulatory related expenses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I think I mentioned that during the script, but if you take a look at our regulatory expense build, year-over-year I think we grew our regulatory related expenses, expenses associated with everything from AML to compliance et cetera, et cetera by about $300 million. So that expense growth that we got this year that has been more than offset by some of the efficiency programs over two years it's probably -- there was probably an additional $200 million to $300 million that we had in expense growth in 2012 over 2011 level, and it's just based upon the way we\u2019re looking at 2014 we\u2019re likely to have an additional $200 million to $300 million of incremental regulatory expense in 2014, all of which we expect to be able to cover.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So when I say expenses flat to down it means we\u2019re covering the incremental regulatory expenses, it means covering the incremental investment spend or with repositioning actions. And obviously if the environment changes, if we end up with an environment that doesn\u2019t look like we\u2019re going to get any revenue growth then we\u2019ll take other actions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay, it's helpful color. And then just separately within the equity trading, you have been gaining a lot of momentum there at the last few quarters, and I can appreciate any one given quarter there can be some noise, but just -- I mean is that kind of just a blip you think in terms of the progress that you have made there especially in the equity derivative side or is there something else that we should be thinking about?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Matt, you\u2019re referring to the quarter-over-quarter performance. I think as we look, I think on a relative basis as you look across and we\u2019ll see where everybody finishes. I think we\u2019re appearing to be kind of roughly in line in terms of our equity performance albeit coming from a lower base. But from our perspective as John described, I don\u2019t think on the derivative side yet we\u2019ve got trading where we\u2019d like it to be. And so I think that unfortunately none of this is linear, but I think we\u2019re making progress and I think in \u201914 we\u2019ll continue to make progress on that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. Thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay, Matt.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>James Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Hi, good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Hi, Jim.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>James Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Hi, just maybe a quick question maybe following up on the prior question on fixed income in a couple of ways. If we look at the last couple of quarters, at Citi Holdings, your balance sheet really has been pretty flat. Given your capital strength and I think trading assets were down, I mean, given your capital strength and the potential that some of your peers overseas are de-leveraging to you. Why shouldn\u2019t we start seeing that part -- that grow? What needs to get, what needs to happen if you are to get more comfortable in growing your balance sheet given your capital strength?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Well I think that, as you look at a couple of pieces, I think one is I think that some of the transition or uncertainty kind of coming through the summer months around some of the transition of rates in the EM and whether it's against the bits economy and some of those that came under pressure. I think that we have had some of our trading desk probably trading closer to home and probably for parts of the second and the half of the year been more risk off. But again I think as our trading desk see opportunities they are free to go after them. So, I\u2019d say there\u2019s nothing prescribed here, but I think our trading desk in parts of the world decided to take some risk off as we got into the second half of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>James Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">That makes sense. Just maybe as a follow up to that, we have had the fed decide to taper, we do have a budget deal, do you think that has changed at all the tone when you talk to your trading desk of things feeling a little bit better as we go into \u201814 or no?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yeah, I think so. I think you have conversations probably Jim that range from things feel less bad to conversations that actually things are feeling better. And I think when you look around the world, I think in some ways 2013 probably surprised itself in terms of what happened from growth. We had a number of revisions out of some of the big countries, big regions down. And I think as you look across the globe in 2014 you\u2019ve got most of those areas at a minimum stabilized and in many areas coming back up. So I think that people feel and you can look at the way on the fixed income side you\u2019re trading. I think people certainly feel much more comfortable with the taper, the $10 billion a month taper today versus where we were five or six months ago. So the answer I think is, yes. I think the environment is better.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>James Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay, great that\u2019s helpful, and just one last question on transaction services. I would appreciate the challenging rate environment, but I guess I\u2019m just getting, struggling with big volume growth but flat revenues across the board. It seems like your NIM overall has been pretty stable; what is unique to that business that you\u2019re still seeing big compression in spreads?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I wouldn\u2019t say it's anything unique to that business. When you take a look at our transaction services business it really is just similar to any other deposit business where you\u2019ve seen the impact of spread compression and it's just the, one of the ways that we get paid for doing cash management work is through balances that people leave with us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>James Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Fair, but I think it seems like if we look at your competitors in disclosures, deposit spreads have been pretty stable over the last one of two quarters, just wondering why we\u2019re not starting to see a little bit more impact on revenues from volume growth.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Actually all I can tell you is that we\u2019re continuing to see the volume growth just able to offset the spread compression.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>James Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay, fair enough. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">All right.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thank you. Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Hi, Guy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Well, I guess probably by now good afternoon. I just wanted to dig in a little bit on the decline that you -- in FICC. You talked about spread products in particular securitized, but I guess also credit and I just wanted to get some clarity on how much of that decline was emerging markets as opposed to more domestic stuff?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Guy, when we talk about the decline I just want to make sure that I answer your question. You\u2019re talking about the sequential decline?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Actually both; the sequential and the year-over-year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">All right. Then from a sequential -- I\u2019ll be very specific. On a sequential basis as I said, when we take a look at rates and currencies and the environment in which it was operating and in the fourth quarter very similar to third quarter, low single digit reduction in revenues and no real noticeable fall off have with anything to do with the emerging markets because the environment was the same. When you take a look at year-over-year we did have a bit more of a drop off in rates and currencies on a year-over-year basis and the bulk of that drop off would have been seen in the emerging markets, just a change in sentiment from where we were at the tail end of last year to where we were at the end of 2013 regarding emerging markets and that has been reflected in our year-over-year rates and currencies. And I think if you go back and if you remember when I said it, it was probably a year ago and probably in the first quarter, pretty complementary of our trading desk saying that I felt our trading desk in particular in the EM had done an exceptional job in terms of trading QE of the intermediation between central banks, financial institutions, corporate users, et cetera. And I think clearly really for mid year on, we've seen a slowing of that QE-related activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Got it, that's helpful. And I think I heard John say that the linked quarter increase in RWA density and I guess just RWAs was pretty much all driven by operational risks, in turn would that just be the higher litigation costs over the last year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Guy, you did hear that correctly. And it's driven by the higher level of litigation related activity throughout the industry. It's much more of an assessment of what's going on in the industry. When we take a look at operational risk in our various businesses, we have to look both at ourselves but also at the industry as far as measuring the type of operational risks that our businesses face. So it's very much our view as to what's happening not just with us, but with some of the other things that you've seen hit the press as far as the industry.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Got it. So if a couple of your very large competitors had some outside issues, ultimately that does impact to some extent your own operational risk?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">That is correct, Guy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay, that helps too. As we think about those litigation costs, I think I heard you hinting that going forward into 2014 we should probably keep something like the same run rate. Is that all the way through the year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I'm just going to leave it that we think that given the current environment you should anticipate legal and related expenses staying at elevated levels.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And how does that intersect with the baseline kind of $44.2 billion or $44.3 billion of operating expense? That should come above and beyond that as we think about that, I just want to make sure I'm clear on what's done?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Yes, Guy. That would be above the $43 billion number we talked about.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And reposition ongoing sort of low level but persistent repositioning charges, those are outside of that number too or in it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Those are outside of that number that I was specifically talking about, but they are in when we talk about achieving the efficiency ratios for 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Got it, by which time of course as you pointed out you should be getting some of the benefit of the earlier ones.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And then a final one from me, the runoff in Holdings slowed and continued but it did slow in the quarter quite a bit. Any sense that you can share with us as to why that happened?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Yes, I think \u2013 again, we're opportunistic in terms of what the market offers us and in this case again, we'll take advantage of any prices out there where we think that the sale of that and the combination of reduced expenses, derisking give up in terms of revenue where those trade-offs make sense, I think in the fourth quarter there was probably less of those but again I think as we think about the Holdings portfolio, I would say from a primary objective it is to drive Holdings to breakeven as soon as practically possible. And again, at this point we've got Holdings assets below 6% of GAAP assets for the firm, it's not a meaningful number in terms of the overall area of the firm and again, it's the optimization of how we continue to wind that down with an emphasis on getting it to break even.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay, fair enough. So you're still obviously exploring opportunities as they make sense to sell chunks [ph]?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Absolutely.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Great, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Thank you, Guy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Guggenheim. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Thanks. I wanted to ask you a little bit about, just kind of an accounting technical question. Is there any way that you could have \u2013 Citi Holdings is getting smaller, take that and almost put it into discontinued operations as you're really looking to make a B breakeven, and then it just kind of comes off the income statement?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Marty, no, the answer is no.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So there's no way that you could envision being able to lengthen it sort of enough to separate it out?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">No, there isn't.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay. The other thing was as we saw some of the securities and capital market revenues come in, we haven't seen the expenses come down as quickly. Does that reflect more of a \u2013 kind of a fixed base there a little bit more than the bearable base, and as you see them pop back up in revenues, will expenses stay relatively flat and not offset a lot of rebound you might see in the first half of the year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Well, Marty, when we tend to look at these things, we tend to look at full year efficiency ratios. And again, I think if you take a look at what we've done with securities and banking over the course of the full year, we have taken expenses down, expenses have come down as we said by 3% as we've actually grown revenues 4%. And when you take a look at the efficiency ratios that we now have in securities and banking, we've gone from something north of 60% to where this year, for 2013, we've now reduced the efficiency or improved the efficiency ratio to 59%. So we're really conscious of taking expenses out. You may not see the variability quarter-to-quarter but you should certainly see it year-over-year and we think that we've been able to make fairly steady progress on that front in securities and banking.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">All right, I think we can see that efficiency kind of coming through the numbers, I'm just wondering on the variability tying one to the other versus kind of setting a base that's in your building efficiencies, what you think you're going to produce and then you get the kind of positive variability and upticks as you might get in revenue?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yes. And again when you take a look at ICG overall, as we said, our comp ratio and that certainly is a lot when it comes to the extent that you've got variability, you might think of it at least traditionally in terms of comp. Our comp ratio right now in our institutional business is at 29% and of course embedded in that would be the truly variable aspect of it which would be incentive compensation, which is obviously lower than 29%. So you have to take in terms of variability with some of those constraints.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And then just lastly the steepening of the yield curve, what kind of things are you seeing that might help just the net interest margin to be able to remain with some of the gains you've seen here recently? Is there some favorable inner spreads on the trading account or just reinvestment yields being higher that might \u2013 if we can keep the yield curve at this level and be positive going into 2014?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Well, as far as we're concerned the biggest help would be some movement on the short end of the curve. We've begun to see some movement in the 5-year to 10-year maybe as low as the 3, but the short end of the curve has been pretty flat. And we are positioned to benefit from a rise in rates but it's really going to have to come more on the short end to really get the lion share of the benefit.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay, Marty, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Hi, how are you?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Hi, Betsy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">So a couple of questions. One, you indicated earlier the mortgage MSR sale that you are just beginning to do. Can you just give us some color on how you're thinking about how that's going to be impacting expenses? I know you indicated it was predominately delinquency related, so you could help us out there that would be helpful. Plus RWA reduction in Holdings, is it going to have some noticeable impacts there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Let me take the second one first, no. You're not going to see because it's mortgaging servicing, these aren't on balance sheet assets, so you're really not going to see a change in the Holdings RWA\u2026</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Sure. No, I was just hopeful on operational risk or something like that, but I guess not, okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">When you think in terms of operational risk, I wish it was simply as easy as you take an action and you see a result. What happens with operational risk is someone else takes an action and that causes you to really need to add to your operational risk. And then it takes three, five years for that operational risk to eventually kind of wash out. So unfortunately operational risk has a long half life and it's just going to be with us for a while, but getting back to your original question Betsy as far the mortgage sale, I think the biggest benefit you\u2019re going to see there would be from an expense point of view. When it comes to processing or servicing delinquent loan, that\u2019s probably -- that other than foreclosed loans, that\u2019s the most expensive loan processing that we have. And just to give you a frame of reference, a non-performing loan you can have annual servicing fees of 15, 20, 25 times the size of the annual servicing fee for a performing loan. So when -- it may sound like it\u2019s a small sale, but again its 20% of the 60 plus day delinquent loan book in Citi Mortgage and so that\u2019s pretty important.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay. Then on repositioning charges that you indicated the first half of \u201914 could be running at similar to 4Q13. Is that -- are those repositioning charges for first half \u201914 related to things you\u2019ve already announced like the Texas sale and the Philadelphia exit or does that also include things you haven\u2019t yet announced?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">It would include things that we\u2019ve not yet announced.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay. And then lastly just on -- I want to make sure I understand what you were saying about the American Airlines credit card. Are you saying that you want that going forward for American and U.S airlines merger?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">What we\u2019ve right now is an agreement with our partner American Airlines that when they merge the two frequent flyer programs and they anticipate doing that in around mid 2015. At that point in time we will have exclusive rights to issue cards.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay. So did you have to pay anything to get those rights?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">We are not release in terms of the agreement at this point in time, okay?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay. But anything that was in that -- is in this quarter\u2019s run rate?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Exactly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Great. Okay. All right, thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">All right.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Hi. Just to confirm John, so are you committing to show -- for Citi to show positive operating leverage in 2014? I know you said expenses should be flat to lower, but is that assuming revenues will be higher?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I didn\u2019t say anything about committing Citi to positive operating leverage for 2014. That\u2019s not something that I\u2019m going to talk about right now Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay. Is that because you aren\u2019t sure if you will get it or you don\u2019t give that sort of forecast or \u2026?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">That\u2019s rather a long range forecast. We don\u2019t do things like try to guide you quarter-by-quarter on earnings. So I will give you general expense guidance as far as what we\u2019re trying to do with expenses and expenses again and I couched it with assuming there was going to be a low single-digit revenue growth rate in Citicorp that we would expect that operating expense to -- to be at or below. But there is a whole other slew of items such as things that we don\u2019t know about and what I\u2019ve talked about thus far is the legal environment. Right now we\u2019d anticipate that being continued elevated, but I\u2019m certainly not going to forecast where legal expenses are going to be for the year and that would certainly drive into a lot as to whether or not we\u2019re going to have a (technical difficulty) leverage going into next year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay. Well maybe my follow-up is for Mike. I think your message has resonated with a good group of people in terms of managing Citigroup more as a portfolio businesses where you have optionality. You have that chart with resource allocation with your four buckets optimize and grow, invest to grow, optimize, restructure, stay the course. So I\u2019m just wondering when you\u2019re going to take another move as you say it\u2019s an uncertain and challenging environment and it's tough to make two strong a forecast, Citigroup has missed earnings expectations two quarters in a row. Citigroup is the only big bank that trades below tangible book value and it\u2019s been not quite a year since your March 5 presentation. So as an analyst I feel as though I\u2019ve been watching this movie and personally I\u2019ve liked what I\u2019ve seen for the first year, but I feel like I\u2019m at intermission now on the second box of popcorn waiting for your next act. And when do we get to see more about the restructuring at Citigroup?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Well I think when you look Mike, if you look at 2013 and you look at what we manage to accomplish in essence in the first half of the your movie or in your first box of popcorn, we had revenues up, we had expenses down, we grew EBIT by 28%, net income by 15%. We grew loans, we grew deposits, we shrunk holdings by 25%, we significantly increased our capital. We used DTA, we explicitly used foreign tax credits that are on the clock and so when we look at and as we\u2019ve described for 2014 as John has used the words, we\u2019re going to continue to be focused on our execution. And we think the environment economically while getting better remains challenging, low single digit revenue growth. We got to be mindful of expenses and I think it when you look at the drivers in our business we\u2019re making progress against it and whether that\u2019s deposit growth, loan growth, purchase card sales, you go through the check list of those things and the fundamentals are there and for \u201914 we\u2019re going to stay focused on doing that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Well John mentioned that some of the repositioning charges ahead are for some actions not yet taken. Can you give us any sort of preview of where you\u2019re looking?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Well the way I would describe it Mike and we\u2019ve talked about it before is that what we\u2019re really trying to do is drive the mentality into the business of are businesses making decisions of how and where and with whom they should be doing their business. And rather than having the series of one-offs, I want to become to work towards in essence as you\u2019ve described this portfolio of businesses that we need to make sure we\u2019re optimizing and running in the right way. And I think in there what you would see is a continued series of business moves I don\u2019t think I would sweep it all together and ascribe a big fundamental change to the company or to the strategy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">But it builds on the optimization bucket and lot of the actions Mike that that we\u2019re talking about doing in early in 2014 would fall into that bucket of optimize. We got countries where we can still rationalize our branch footprint and take out expenses and so that really is just continuing the execution on the strategy that Mike talked about last March.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Maybe as a follow-up and more specifically page 5 of your March 5 presentation from last year Mike, you talked about the execution priorities and Citi Holdings wind down. I mean, you\u2019ve made great progress year-over-year, it's kind of like if I look at the year it seems like big progress, but the quarter wasn\u2019t great progress. The question is are you temporarily stalled or should we see a redemption of greater DTA utilization in the quarters ahead, greater Citi Holdings wind down ahead and greater expense reductions ahead?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Again, I think that we\u2019ve got to look what\u2019s obviously in the best interest of our stakeholders and shareholders and when you look at what the world like, what our shareholders want us to describe value simply to get a headline GAAP reduction in Citi Holdings. As John said I think we\u2019ve made real progress in terms of reducing that drag and today largely what we\u2019re faced with is the legal build around legacy issues. We can\u2019t control those. So we\u2019re not going to make silly choices to simply sell assets to get a reduction in assets as opposed to really trying to manage in the round risk reduction, expense reduction against give up of income and net income against that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">And Mike when you talk about the DTA and this is (technical difficulty) building on what Mike just said, when you look at our DTA utilization for the year and I mentioned the number of 2.4 billion, that basically all came out of earnings. When you take a look at the impact on DTA utilization through other comprehensive income, it was basically nothing, it was just flat. But if you break the earnings component down, we had our Citicorp businesses utilize $3.3 billion of DTA and the losses that we continued to have in Holdings actually created 900 million. That's one of the reasons why driving Holdings down to breakeven is so important because we think again that will allow our investors to see the full capacity that our franchise has for utilizing that DTA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">And then last follow-up. I mean you have said this before, to the extent that housing has improved, liquidity has improved, stock markets have improved, that should improve your optionality to take more aggressive actions. So that better environment combined again with the stock trading below tangible book value, doesn't that make you want to be a lot more aggressive or at least a little bit more aggressive?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Again, I think that we've got a footprint as I've spoken about that is unique and it's up to us to get the most out it. You saw us during the course of the year Turkey, Paraguay, Uruguay continuing to rationalize a consumer footprint, and again I think we'll continue to look at those things on the edges but I don't want to mislead you, Mike. We're not looking for any big move here in terms of the strategy of the firm.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">All right, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Thank you, Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Thank you. John, in your comments about your FICC trading numbers on a full year this year versus last year you mentioned that there was a change of sentiment in the emerging markets which caused the trading to be weaker. Was that due to the U.S. government shutdown in the middle of the year? What do you think caused the changes in the sentiment in the emerging markets?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Gerard, it's Mike. I think we've pointed to a couple of things. I think one, I think clearly there was a concern or a sentiment shift for a period of time after Chairman Bernanke's comments on May 22nd. I think for a period of time people were uncertain as to how they were thinking about that. I think we then went into a period of time where people were worried about this rate transition and in particular an essence those budget deficit economies and we had the evolution of the bits or the fives that came out of that and some concerns reemerged around the emerging economies. I think we then went into September and October we started to really enter into some of the Washington in pass-around budget, et cetera and I think it was kind of a combination of those things really throughout the latter half of the second into the third and fourth quarter that I think weighed on people.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Thank you. And in regards to your comments on the operational risk, how it's increased the denominator in the equation, can you guys quantify for us the basis points, how much it's costing you in the ratio from a basis point perspective? Is it 30 basis points?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">No. When you work it all the way through, it's somewhere in the vicinity of 50 basis points.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Okay. And John you guys pointed out you had some success in selling some of those mortgages, I believe, inside of Citi Holdings. What did you receive in terms of a price versus your carrying value?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Are you talking about the sale that we just announced as far as the nonperforming loans because that was backed out of our servicing portfolio or are you back to the 400 million or so of loan sales that we had during the quarter? I just want to be\u2026</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Yes, the 400 million that you mentioned, correct, in the fourth quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">There's not significant economies associated with that sale.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Okay. In terms of the Basel III SIN [ph] buckets that all the banks are dealing with, what do you have left to monetize so that you can kind of reduce some of them?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">I'm sorry, the Basel III SIN buckets\u2026</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Yes, sure, where you've got to deduct that from your capital. Obviously the DTA is the big one but there are all the equity ownerships.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Okay, exactly. Well, we still have the equity ownership that we have through our partnership with LQIF, so that's our ownership interest in Banco de Chile. And that is still there. And the other one of size would be our investment in Guangfa Bank in China.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Okay. The other I guess final one is any color or refinement you can give us about the CCAR, how it went in terms of how you guys got your arms around it and what do you think the expectations are?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">No. We've made our submission and we'll be waiting like everybody else for the early March results.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Marquardt with Evercore. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Hi, Andrew.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Hi, guys. A couple of questions in terms of the regulatory costs that you mentioned in terms of being embedded in that 44 billion plus kind of core run rate, each year kind of 200 million, 300 million incrementally this year as well. Are those costs that are kind of permanent each year or are we kind of coming to an end in terms of this year at least as far as you can tell that might be the last of it and are those permanent or will those then reverse at some point?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">I would say very, very few of them will reverse. I think that those are just the incremental costs of doing business now for banks and I don't think we're the only bank that's going through that. So those are just costs that are going to be embedded in our expense base going forward as we need to meet new requirements. And there still is some expense billed. I don't want to categorically say that 2014 is the last billed in that expense base, but I guess we're all sort of hopeful that certainly, in the near term, you'll start to see some of those incremental expenses, the growth rate abate.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Got it, that's helpful. So it sounds like those are in response to kind of new evolving regulatory burdens rather than kind of catch up and so they may be related to the changed kind of guidelines on CCAR, CLAR counterparty credit risk, et cetera. Is that fair versus kind of a catch up?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">I'd say it's a combination of \u2013 and it depends on how you think about the catch up, but it's in the areas that you noted but it's also in other important areas as far as anti-money laundering and KYC and some of the mortgage-related expenses where we've got enhanced requirements. So I'd say it's a combination of new things as well as I guess what you could say are enhanced expectations on the part of various regulatory bodies as to how you're going to comply with various regulations.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Thanks. And then I'll try another way at it. In terms of the expense base on a core basis, you mentioned that kind of a low revenue type backdrop. If the revenue environment ends up being ultimately worse than that, right, if it's flat or down, could it be down even more or are there additional levers in the door to pull if that were to play out?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Yes, I would say that certainly the first thing that you would do if the environment looked like it was going to be even more challenging than we think it was going to be, the first thing you would stop is, you'd stop a certain amount of investment spending. And so that would be an immediate lever that you could pull. If you thought it was going to go deeper than that, you would re-pace other things. We might re-pace some of the other systems work that we're doing. You would then also take a look at various \u2013 the capacity that you've got in different businesses. So there's many levers that you can pull depending upon your view of the economy and the degree to which you think that the economy will differ from what you've got baked into your base plan.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Thanks. And then separately around the operational respect going up for you and others this last quarter in the capital calculation, I hear you on legal factors for all. Is it also related potentially to counterparty credit risk that was kind of a new factor thrown in for the CCAR this upcoming process in terms of top 20, top 50 in terms of monitoring them on a pretty regular basis, and how do you think that that may or may not impact CCAR process generally? And maybe for you just as a reminder that it seems like you'd probably be in a better position, especially now that you have \u2013 the government kind of out of your house on the FDIC TruPS as well for the first time? Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Just to start with one other question that you posed, the new requirement that got baked into this year's CCAR, that didn't contribute anything towards our reassessment of our operational risk weighted assets. That couldn\u2019t play a role in that at all. That was really just taking a look at the legal and regulatory environment that we currently see. As far as how that particular requirement, that particular added requirement impacted the CCAR test. We factored it in, and we didn\u2019t see that it posed any significant constraint on us, but it was just another one of these interesting twists that we\u2019re going to have to deal with I think in each CCAR. I think it's good on the part of the fed so that they\u2019re constantly changing things up and making you think about new different risks and so I actually think that putting in new requirements like that benefits the industry.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">All right, thanks. And then just lastly on SMB, mentioned how the environment muted in the fourth quarter and maybe third quarter as well last year. Maybe I missed it, did you -- have you commented in terms of has that turned early this year so far and how does that maybe specifically effect business get impacted from QE tapering near-term, long-term. Is it a net positive, net negative; how should we kind of think about it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Well it's a little difficult to judge a quarter or a year based upon the first 10 or so trading days. So I don\u2019t want to go too far out there. But I would say certainly the first 10 days of January look a lot better than what we saw in December and November, so I\u2019d go that far.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">And QE tapering does that have an impact in a meaningful way one way or the other or higher loan rates?</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">The difficult again -- rates shot up for a while and just when everybody got comfortable with, I\u2019d say the 10 year being something at around 3% or higher you had the jobs reports come in last Friday and suddenly the 10 year rate drops down to something with a 2, 8 handle. So I think that we all like to see a rate view that settles out and it's better when everyone has a view towards rates gradually increasing or gradually decreasing whichever you can deal with. The problem is we\u2019re still dancing around things and so there\u2019s a little bit more volatility than you can, then I would say is optimal at this point in time and that\u2019s just -- that just continues the general uncertainty regarding the economy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Thanks, John.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Your next question comes from the line of Fred Cannon with KBW. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Frederick Cannon - Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Great, thanks. I just had a follow up on some of the DTA comments. I guess one broad one is the DTA was down $2.4 billion as you suggested. It's still kind of above year end 2011 levels and I was wondering if we could see an acceleration of the utilization next year. And in line with that one of the things Mike had said was that, you did make progress against the foreign tax credit portion of the DTA that does start to run out meaningfully in 2016 and 2017, and I was wondering if you could give us some numbers behind that, how much of that was foreign tax credit utilization?</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">Yes, sure Fred. Let's start with the last one. As far as the foreign tax credit utilization, now we as Mike and I said, we utilized about during the year $2 billion of the FTC carry forward and you can just, all you have to do is just open up last year's 10K and its $2 billion off of the schedule based upon when they run out. So I think there was $400 million or so that was due to expire in 2015; that would now go away.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Frederick Cannon - Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">And then there was $6.6 billion I believe that was due to expire in 2016, so then that now would be reduced by $1.6 billion, so we would be down to $5 billion there. So pretty much it follows the schedule.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Frederick Cannon - Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">All right. And then as far as what can we do next year on DTA, and from your other comment, again I\u2019d point you to some of the comments I made earlier. When you take a look at the $2.4 billion that we utilized this year, $3.3 billion of that came from Citi Corp earnings and then we had the Citi Holdings losses actually work against us to the tune of about $900 million. So what we can certainly do to continue to increase the utilization of DTA is really to get those holdings losses closer to breakeven and that would allow more of that $3.3 billion of Citi Corp utilization than to drop through to the bottom line.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Frederick Cannon - Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">And I think, just as a follow you have talked in the past about kind of meeting North American earnings to utilize the DTA. Is that more related to getting the Citi Holdings down or is it other activity in North America?</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">Well, it's also growing North America earnings. So certainly as we begin to see our branded cards business revitalize as we hopefully get some earnings out of the Best Buy acquisition, all of those things should be positive towards our North America earnings as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Frederick Cannon - Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">Great. Thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">Not a problem, Fred.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">Your next question comes from the line of Derek De Vries with UBS. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Derek De Vries - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">Thanks. It's Derek here. I have couple of questions. Just coming back to securities and banking kind of the glide path to your 2015 target. Your 75 basis points ROA in the division for the full-year, and I\u2019m just wondering where does that number have to be to kind of get you with the business mix and everything to your 90 to 110;<strong> </strong>does that have to be at 90 or is it 75 or 100, where does that have to be?</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">Derek, we didn\u2019t give specific targets business by business because again we wanted to make sure that people understood that what we were focused on was improving the ROA for Citigroup as a whole. But you\u2019re quite right; we would need to do some incremental ROA improvement out of securities and banking, but quite frankly it isn\u2019t significant, don\u2019t forget our target overall for the firm is 90 to 110 basis points by 2015. You\u2019ve got securities and banking at 75, quite frankly it doesn\u2019t take -- you don\u2019t need to get securities and banking up into that 90 to 110 basis point range in order for the full firm to produce to 90 basis points.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Derek De Vries - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">Yeah, and that was sort of my questionnaire. And now just to follow-on that, I mean, I guess the 75 is being impacted by some litigation expense and some things that probably fall out at some point maybe not 2015, but can you just give a broad sense as to how much it falls out of that sort of 2013 number if you will like what's the sort of non-core operating expenses that\u2019s in there for this year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">Well I don\u2019t want to tell you that legal and related expenses are non-core.</p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"><strong>Derek De Vries - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">Sorry, I know what you mean.</p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">You\u2019re always going to have some level. And we really haven't specified business by business what we would consider to be normal legal and related expenses. So I just prefer not to go into that. There are some repositioning expenses that we have taken in that business that are probably higher this year, but I think you\u2019re talking about $50 million plus in 2013 expenses that you might look at and say that, it's either related to repositioning and that could go away, but we still think that there are ways of improving the overall efficiency of securities and banking of ICG and we still intend to hit those targets in 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"><strong>Derek De Vries - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">Okay, and then just the last question on this area; the assets -- the average assets in the business kind of were at $917 million in Q4 of last year and ended the year at $883 million and is that just a reflection of when and where you see opportunities, you\u2019re kind of thinking it would be somewhere around the $900 million level or is that kind of a thought process on evolution of business mix?</p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">I think it's probably a combination of a couple of things. One is, I said I think that again our desk I think decided in parts of the later year to de-risk the positions and again they\u2019re free to put those back on as they see fit obviously within our risk parameters. But I also think that one of the things we\u2019ve tried and I think the ROA mentality of the ROA targets has helped because we want to become more efficient in the usage of our balance sheet. So I think we certainly had at least in my opinion some lazy assets that were on the balance sheet that just don\u2019t make sense there. And I would like to in essence re-use that capacity for better earning usage of the balance sheet around client flows, and I think that we\u2019re probably going through a bit of that recycling now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"><strong>Derek De Vries - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">Okay, that\u2019s fine. And then just totaling changing gears on you, but the delinquencies in the North American consumer business ticked up in Q4 which I guess surprised me a little bit. And how should we think about that going forward? I mean is the message kind of, look it got as good as it gets and we probably just tick very slowly up from here or is it like a one quarter, don't read too much into it. We could tick back down again next quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">I would say it's somewhere around that. Look it's one quarter, don't read too much into it. But obviously we've had a real good performance when it comes to delinquencies and credit in North America. At some point in time, you're going to get some increase in delinquencies in that book. We don't think that that lends itself to dramatic increases in NCL rates. We gave you some guidance as far as where we see the NCL rate somewhat stabilizing for North America. And so I wouldn't read too much into it, but you're going to get some natural creep. The important thing is that the overall dynamics of the business we're still very focused on maintaining credit discipline there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"><strong>Derek De Vries - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">Okay, that's helpful, appreciate it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"><strong>Kenneth Usdin - Jefferies</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">Thanks. Good morning. John, just following on the credit side, obviously there has been continued really strong results that have led you to release reserves a little bit above and beyond just four charge-offs. Can you talk about how we can think about the direction of reserve release and do you think it's possible that the overall Citigroup provision could be still down next year over this year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">Let me separate that into two different answers \u2013 actually three, all right. When you look at the provision, I think we've already seen in our international consumer business that we're not releasing reserves anymore. As a matter of fact as our portfolios build because we've got the loan growth \u2013 the 8% growth in revenues in Latin America, continued growth elsewhere in Asia, besides Korea, you're going to see loan loss reserve build in and we actually had a build of something like $75 million, I think, in the fourth quarter. So the international consumer has already made that turn. When you look at the U.S. consumer, there's probably still some level of reserve release to go through in some of our cards business, but that is drawing to a close and we'll probably see the end of that sometime in 2014. And then the third piece would be in Holdings. What I would say in Holdings is we anticipate being able to offset the U.S. mortgage NCL \u2013 substantially offset the U.S. mortgage NCLs with continued reserve releases. But I don't see reserve releases over and above the NCLs that we have in the business. As a matter of fact the reserve releases will be probably on an ongoing basis be just slightly less than the NCLs that we're seeing in that U.S. mortgage business and Holdings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p25\"><strong>Kenneth Usdin - Jefferies</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p25\">Okay. And the second question just relates to the top line. If we're in a low single-digit revenue growth environment, it does seem like there is a better trajectory to be able to grow NII in a year-over-year basis. So I just wondered if I can ask you if you can help us separate. Can you get growth in both NII and on the fee side or what do you think will contribute a greater amount to kind of the overall top line performance?</p>", "<p class=\"p p25\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p25\">Well, I do think that you can \u2013 especially if the economy continues to improve and it doesn't have another one of these growth then back off and then growth and then back off and everybody gets concerned again. Even if we can just get the economy moving in a steady direction, I do think that you can get growth in both NII as well as fee. I don't think \u2013 I'm trying in my mind to figure out whether or not you can actually do a percentage where you get 50% of your growth here and 50% there. But I'll just leave it with the fact that you can grow both. And when it looks \u2013 it's something like our transaction services fees business and our cash business in transaction services, we're actually focused on moving more of that business away from an NII business and onto a fee-based business. And that's going to be important for us, because again we're continuing to capture market share in our cash management business and there is just a limit to how much more deposits that we can attract while still trying to keep our overall balance sheet somewhat flat at that $1.9 trillion range or thereabouts. So it's important then as we attract new clients, we grow the volumes with existing clients that we move some of that business into fee-based business as opposed to just being paid for it by \u2013 with increasing levels of deposits.</p>", "<p class=\"p p25\"><strong>Kenneth Usdin - Jefferies</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p25\">And the last thing then for '14 though, you think that even with year-over-year tough comp in mortgage banking and whatever of getting out of trading, that's a reasonable expectation that there is still a good chance that we can see some fee growth?</p>", "<p class=\"p p25\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p25\">Yes, now \u2013 I mean again, I'm thinking about fee growth in transaction services and fee growth in things other than mortgage. Obviously, the mortgage comp in the first half of the year will be a challenge because as I said the mortgage revenues certainly have stabilized. So if you think in terms of \u2013 from a sequential basis, on a sequential basis I do believe that you can see growth in both NII and fees. You're going to be challenged year-on-year with that comparison certainly in the first half of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p25\"><strong>Kenneth Usdin - Jefferies</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p25\">Okay, got it. Thanks very much, John.</p>", "<p class=\"p p25\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p25\">Okay, not a problem.</p>", "<p class=\"p p25\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p25\">Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p25\"><strong>Erika Penala Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p25\">Yes, good afternoon. My questions have all been asked and answered. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p25\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p25\">Thank you, Erika.</p>", "<p class=\"p p25\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p25\">Your next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p25\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p25\">I've really only got two things given that I think we're in our second movie to get second box of popcorn at this point. But you talked a lot about the legal costs. Can you talk given that you've settled some things that a number of your peers haven't yet, could you talk where these costs are rising from?</p>", "<p class=\"p p25\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p25\">Certainly when you take a look at Holdings, we've talked about this. Still the single largest piece there would be legacy issues related to private label securitizations and mortgages. And that seems to still \u2013 that certainly is an area that is still out there and there is \u2013 there are a lot of issues surrounding that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p26\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p26\">Okay. Just last thing is that you've talked a lot about trying to get Holdings down to breakeven. What about \u2013 I mean if you could structure your transaction with one name that would separate earnings out but would actually create book value, would that be of interest or is that not of interest to Citigroup?</p>", "<p class=\"p p26\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p26\">Moshe, we look at it in a few ways. One is what's that the value, the residual value or the present value of the earnings of that business and can we get paid for that? Second thing is that if somebody's not willing to pay for that, we've obviously got a good use of that around DTA utilization. And again in that path of getting the essence at one-for-one benefit of Holdings from doing that. We've looked at a number of different structures that could be accomplished there. I think we're open to those but we don't want to find ourselves in a position where we're in essence giving away earnings, being forced to finance it for a period of time and giving away the upside in the oversight of the business. So if we could accomplish the things we want to accomplish, we'd be open to it but we haven't seen that structure yet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p26\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p26\">Got it. Just as a comment, not a question, I would just say that selling its discount to tangible book reflects some concern about the book value of that and there is an asset that's clearly undervalued, so thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p26\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p26\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p26\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p26\">Thank you, Moshe.</p>", "<p class=\"p p26\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p26\">Your next question comes from the line of David Hilder with Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p26\"><strong>David Hilder - Drexel Hamilton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p26\">Hi. Thanks very much for your patience. Two unrelated questions. One, I assume that some of that increase in regulatory costs is Volcker rule compliant. Do you see any potential exit of businesses or downsizing of businesses as a result of the final Volcker rule?</p>", "<p class=\"p p26\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p26\">I think that we've taken the actions that we need to take really associated with Volcker. As far as we already seized proprietary trading activities sometime in 2012, I think was the last proprietary trading business that we had. As you've seen in various press stories, we're in the process of winding down our Citi Capital Advisors business which is where we have most of our private equity funds. So we've got both those actions well in hand. As far as your comment or some of those costs related to Volcker, yes, there are some. I mean the Volcker \u2013 there is a data requirement, metrics requirement that one would look at and say it's \u2013 I've heard some people describe it as burdensome. I would never use a word like that, but there certainly is a data requirement that we\u2019re going to have to gear up for and that we are in a process of gearing up for.</p>", "<p class=\"p p26\"><strong>David Hilder - Drexel Hamilton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p26\">Thank you. And any sense of timing on when you might achieve breakeven for Citi Holdings?</p>", "<p class=\"p p26\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p26\">I think that, a lot of that again -- as we\u2019ve talked about Citi Holdings, the big drag there is around legal. And as we\u2019ve said unfortunately we can\u2019t control our timing in that. We love to continue to get these legacy legal issues behind this as quickly and as practically and as reasonably as possible.</p>", "<p class=\"p p26\"><strong>David Hilder - Drexel Hamilton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p26\">Okay. Thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p26\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p26\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p26\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p26\">Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p26\"><strong>Matthew Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p26\">Thanks for taking my question. I\u2019ve got a few other follow ups that I'll work on offline. But bigger picture question I want to ask is in terms of the emerging markets trends, it sounds from your characterization John that you\u2019re a bit more positive about the future trends of economic growth across your emerging markets, countries, that\u2019s in line with GDP expectations that are more positive for \u201914 and \u201915 than they were for the last couple of years, and yet investors continue to be concerned about the growth trajectory in the emerging markets. I guess, I\u2019m just trying to get a sense as to, am I hearing you correctly about Citigroup being more optimistic about the growth trends within the emerging markets and what benefit that might have for potential revenue opportunities within transaction services outside of just short rates going up?</p>", "<p class=\"p p27\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p27\">Matt, it's Mike. I think that you\u2019ve described our economic outlook correctly that I think we see a better world in terms of 2014 than \u201913. I think the overhang or the challenge to that is, when you go back and you look, so we\u2019re in a tapering phase and ultimately we\u2019ll be in a policy transition phase around interest rates. Those transitions at least in my history have never happened smoothly. I think the world is in a better place today in terms of the probability of that happening at least smoother around floating rate exchange regimes, around bigger foreign currency reserves, around better markets, around better external access that these countries have. And so I think as we look at that I think we probably think from a historic basis this transition is probably smoother, growth looks better, the economies continue to heal. A number of countries from the ways I\u2019ve just described things and in fact you saw this summer really five singled out in terms of concern and again the big concern is the theme around those five with current account deficit. And put away from that I think people felt the transition of the rest of the economies which probably are going to be pretty reasonable. So again, I think we\u2019re cautiously optimistic on it and again think that our businesses are well positioned in that transition to take advantage of that growth both from a fundamental basis as well as hopefully from an interest rate basis as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p27\"><strong>Matthew Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p27\">Thanks for taking my question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p27\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p27\">Not a problem, Matt.</p>", "<p class=\"p p27\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p27\">Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with SunTrust. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p27\"><strong>Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p27\">Thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p27\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p27\">Hi, Eric.</p>", "<p class=\"p p27\"><strong>Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p27\">Hi, how are you. I\u2019ll try to keep it tight. At this point you\u2019re somewhat ahead of the curve with respect to your peer group in terms of Basel III compliance and SLR compliance on both a holding company and bank level. So I\u2019m wondering at this point, as you look across the international capital and liquidity regimes, where are your biggest concerns at this stage and what would you consider to be the binding operational constraint for you?</p>", "<p class=\"p p27\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p27\">I think that, Eric as we look something that; and you can imagine with our business model something that we\u2019re focused on is around the concept of a level playing field around harmonization. And what makes it difficult for us is, when you operate multiple jurisdictions, geographies, countries where you\u2019ve just got almost unlimited number of things you\u2019re trying to solve for, and so again I think that as we look at our metrics we think not just in the U.S. but globally we\u2019re at standards that serve us well. But again it's around trying to get some of these things lined up so that there is a level of playing field around the world and that there\u2019s actually a level playing field within those jurisdictions and countries between domestic and international institutions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p27\"><strong>Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p27\">And is there any particular piece of proposed regulation or legislation that is concerning to you with respect to your current capital or liquidity position?</p>", "<p class=\"p p27\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p27\">I think the -- we\u2019ve commented on this in the past, it really is -- its not any individualities, it's how all the individual pieces actually fit together. And again to Mike\u2019s comments that he made earlier as far as harmonization, you can take a look at harmonization in one case and say you would like all the different regulatory bodies around the world to sort of view things the same way. But in the same fashion amongst all the different rules, you would like to see some harmonization as well. You would like to see a little bit perhaps a better interaction between the SLR ratio with the standardized approach with advanced approach, with all requirements, there is just -- there is a bunch of these things out there and I think they do get harmonized over time, but until that happens it makes things a bit challenging.</p>", "<p class=\"p p28\"><strong>Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p28\">And just so then operationally is CCAR your binding constraint or is it something else?</p>", "<p class=\"p p28\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p28\">Well CCAR is certainly a consideration. I mean CCAR becomes a piece of it, but you still -- you run your business based upon risk returns and your ability to monitor risk through some of the other things that I talked about. I wouldn\u2019t say that CCAR is the ultimate, but it becomes the year-end pass/fail test on a few things.</p>", "<p class=\"p p28\"><strong>Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p28\">And just one quick clean-up question. Citi Holdings is 6% of GAAP assets, but what percent of risk weighted assets does it represent at this stage?</p>", "<p class=\"p p28\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p28\">It's about 19% of our risk weighted assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p28\"><strong>Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p28\">19%, okay. Thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p28\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p28\">Not a problem.</p>", "<p class=\"p p28\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p28\">And we have no further questions in the queue at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p28\"><strong>Susan Kendall</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p28\">Hi. This is Susan Kendall. Thank you so much for spending so much time with us today. If you have any follow-up questions, please reach out to investor relations.

Today\u2019s call will be hosted by Peter Kapp, head of Fixed Income Investor Relations.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Mr. Kapp, you may begin.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Peter Kapp</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CFO, John Gerspach, will speak first. Then Eric Aboaf, our Treasurer, will take you through the fixed income investor presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we\u2019ll be happy to take questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results and capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2012 Form 10-K.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">With that said, let me turn it over to John.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you, Peter, and good morning everyone. We\u2019re very pleased to be hosting our fixed income investor review this quarter. Eric Aboaf, our treasurer, will review some specifics on our strong balance sheet, liquidity profile, and capital position, as well as our 2013 issuance activity and current funding plans for 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Before I turn it over to Eric, however, there are some key points from our fourth quarter results that I would like to highlight on slide two. 2013 was as challenging as we thought it would be. Low interest rates, changing expectations regular Fed tapering, and increasing legal settlement costs all had significant impacts on our bottom line.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We reported 2013 adjusted earnings of $13.8 billion and fourth quarter adjusted earnings of $2.6 billion. And, our net interest margin was stable at 285 basis points for the year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">However, we continue to make progress on our execution priorities. We improved our operating efficiency and completed the repositioning effort announced in December 2012. We continued to reduce the earnings drag associated with Citi Holdings and put several legacy issues behind us through settlements with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. And, we utilized $2.4 billion of our deferred tax assets throughout the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Our credit quality remains stable, and we\u2019ve maintained our balance sheet around $1.9 trillion. Finally, our capital and liquidity remained strong, with an estimated Basel III tier one common ratio of 10.5% and high quality liquid assets in excess of $420 billion at the end of the fourth quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Turning to slide three, we summarize Citigroup\u2019s financial results for the quarter. On an adjusted basis, we reported $2.6 billion of net income for the fourth quarter of 2013 and $13.8 billion for the year. For the full year, revenues grew 1% while operating expenses were 2% lower and credit costs also declined by over $2.8 billion, driving earnings growth of 16%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We improved the operating efficiency in Citicorp in 2013, while reducing the net losses in Citi Holdings by nearly half. As a result, Citigroup returns on both GAAP assets and tangible common equity improved year over year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">And with that, let me turn it over to Eric.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><strong>Eric Aboaf</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Thank you, John. Let me start on slide four, with a review of how we\u2019re managing our balance sheet to achieve our business objectives. First, over the past year, we\u2019ve purposely held our total assets at or below $1.9 trillion while adding loans and deposits in a disciplined manner. Second, managing a compact balance sheet has allowed us to maintain our net interest margin, which I\u2019ll discuss more in a moment. And third, this approach allows us to operate at appropriate levels of leverage and build towards our ROA goals.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Overall, on the asset side, net loans grew 3% year over year, and 2% quarter over quarter, as demand from our consumer and corporate customers continues to be supported by the underlying economic recovery, partially offset by the continued wind down of Citi Holdings. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Trading assets [in reverse] and by contrast were down 7% year over year and 4% quarter over quarter as we held less inventory in our markets business. Our counterparties became cautious during the second half of the year as they reacted to news on tapering and possible government default while also positioning themselves for rising interest rates. Cash and investments remained stable in the second half of the year as we maintained a liquid balance sheet. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">On the liability side, we maintained a diversified, stable, and low cost funding profile. Deposits were roughly half of our balance sheet, up 4% year over year and 1% quarter over quarter, as we maintained deposit pricing discipline. Total long term debt was flat in the second half of the year, consistent with previous guidance. And our equity base grew, primarily due to retained earnings and preferred stock issuance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">On slide five, you can see how our active balance sheet management has helped us maintain a stable net interest margin. In the fourth quarter, net interest margin increased to 288 basis points as loan and investment yields somewhat stabilized and funding costs continued to improve, with continued reductions in deposit costs as well as a significant reduction in long term debt costs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">On a full year basis, our NIM improved from 282 basis points for 2012 to 285 basis points for 2013. Loan and investment yield declined throughout 2012 and most of 2013 as the low interest rate environment filtered through both floating rate and fixed rate assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">However, our funding costs also declined, offsetting declining yield. Our deposit costs of 50 basis points this quarter are down 15 basis points year over year with improvement in both our U.S. and international deposit base.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We also saw decline in the interest expense associated with our long term debt and more recently a stepwise reduction in long term debt rates of nearly 30 basis points. In particular, our debt and trust redemptions in the third and fourth quarters targeted higher [unintelligible] securities. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In addition, we have increasingly replaced maturing debt with new issuance at more attractive levels, reflecting both the tightening of our credit spreads and the growing contribution of lower cost debt issued in the securitization market. This slower long term debt cost [is a good step off] for 2014. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We currently believe our net interest margin in 2014 should be at or around the full year 2013 level of 285 basis points with some fluctuations quarter to quarter. This should position us well for revenue growth as we add loans and deposits during the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Turning to slide six, let me summarize our loan growth trajectory. Citicorp loans increased 9% year over year, excluding FX, with growth in both our consumer and corporate loan portfolio. Consumer loans grew 6% year over year. International consumer loan volumes increased 7% year over year, led by double-digit growth in markets such as Mexico, Hong Kong, and India, offset by our ongoing repositioning efforts in Korea. North America consumer loan growth of 4% year over year included the $7 billion Best Buy portfolio acquisition in the third quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"> </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Corporate loans grew 13% year over year, excluding FX, with 12% growth in Asia, 7% growth in EMEA, and 19% growth in North America, which included the consolidation of a $7 billion trade loan portfolio in the second quarter. Within our corporate segment, private bank loans grew 14% with the greatest growth in Asia and North America. Transaction services loans grew 16% ex FX, with growth in each of our regions, reflecting strong initiation growth in trade finance throughout the year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Traditional corporate lending balances increased 7% year over year, as we funded previously extended commitments. Going forward, we expect demand for new loan commitments may remain episodic as many corporates remain highly liquid.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Citi Holdings loans decreased 20% year over year, due to $16 billion of runoff and nearly $7 billion of asset sales, including sales of nearly $2.5 billion from nonperforming mortgages.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On slide seven, I\u2019d like to review the credit trends in our Citicorp consumer and corporate loan portfolios globally, so that you can see how our geographically diversified portfolios that performed over time. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">The top half of the page illustrates Citicorp\u2019s consumer credit trends across our four regions. In the fourth quarter, total net credit losses declined to 2.39% of the portfolio. We have approximately $11 billion of reserves against this portfolio, representing 18 months of coincident NCL coverage.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Credit remained favorable in North America in the fourth quarter, with a decline in the NCL rate reflecting both underlying improvement as well as the impact of the Best Buy portfolio, which was acquired late in the third quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In Asia, credit trends remained stable. In Latin America, we saw an uptick in NCLs. The higher NCL rate in the fourth quarter primarily reflects the impact of portfolio seasoning in Mexico. Looking to full year 2014, we currently expect this portfolio seasoning to continue with the NCL rate in Latin America being broadly in the range of the levels we saw in the second half of 2013.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">The bottom half of the page highlights the quality of our corporate portfolio. Nonaccrual loans as a percentage of corporate loans continued to improve, and as of the end of the fourth quarter, were approximately 58 basis points for the entire portfolio. Current loan loss reserves allocated to our corporate loan portfolio provided nonaccrual loan coverage of approximately 1.5x. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On slide eight, I\u2019d like to provide some additional texture around the international exposures in our loan portfolio. At the top of the page, you can see our consumer business, where we have tailored our product offerings and geographic footprint to best serve customers who are urban based and globally minded. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">This segment, which tends to be more affluent and grows faster than the general population in many markets, will be generally more resilient through economic cycles. We provide them with deposits and investment services and also lend to them through a mix of products - credit cards, mortgages, personal loans - depending on market convention. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">42% of our consumer loans are in the emerging markets, with the five largest emerging geographies representing 28% of all consumer loans. The largest of our consumer exposures is in Mexico, where we remain constructive on the economic outlook, and where we have a leading market position.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In Korea, our loans have been declining. However, NCLs remain relatively stable at 1.2% for the past year, even as we have actively repositioned the franchise to focus on achieving higher returns.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Singapore, Hong Kong, and India are all showing stable and 70 basis points or less loss rates, as you can see on slide 28 in the appendix.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">The bottom half of the page highlights our corporate loan composition. Our clients here are top multinational corporate as well as regional [champions] who value our international network and the breadth and depth of our local capabilities. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Many of our institutional relationships begin with our transaction services business, which is why you see a large position in trade finance in both developed and emerging markets. The operating partnerships central to that business also allow us to capture meaningful share of other products, such as foreign exchange, capital markets advisory, and credit extension.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">About half of our corporate loans are in the emerging markets. However, our focus on diversification results in no single emerging market country accounting for more than roughly 5% of our total exposure.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We continue to believe that emerging markets GDP growth will outpace developed markets, even though recent EM growth has slowed from what we believe is a more sustainable pace. At the same time, our carefully selected investment grade and affluent oriented target markets, which we also describe on slide 26 in the appendix in more detail, should leave us less exposed to volatility in these markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On slide nine, let me shift briefly to the credit trends in North America, the Citi Holdings mortgage portfolio. We ended the quarter with $73 billion of North America mortgages, down 20% from a year ago, while net credit losses declined by 50% and the loss rate improved by roughly 120 basis points.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Here we show the breakdown of residential first mortgages originated in Citi Mortgage versus the legacy Citi financial business. As you can see, while loan balances and net credit losses are declining in both portfolios, the loans originated in Citi Financial are becoming a larger proportion of the total.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">The loss rate overall for North America mortgages was 2% for the fourth quarter, down from 3.2% a year ago. The evolving composition of this portfolio partly obscures some of the underlying credit trends. Given the borrower profile in Citi Financial, these loans tend to have higher loss rates that are around 5% versus a loss rate of around 1% at Citi Mortgage.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We ended the quarter with $4.9 billion of loan loss reserves allocated to North America mortgages in Citi Holdings, or 39 months of NCL coverage. Looking to 2014, assuming the U.S. economic environment remains favorable, we continue to expect to utilize loan loss reserves to offset a substantial portion of our mortgage net credit losses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to slide 10, let\u2019s discuss deposits, which continue to serve as our primary source of funding for our bank. Our overall deposits have grown significantly over the past year, in part reflecting elevated levels of market liquidity and strong corporate balance sheets. Citi\u2019s average deposits grew $27 billion or 4% year over year in constant dollar terms, even though we had a $26 billion reduction related to the transfer of deposits to Morgan Stanley during the second half of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Consumer banking deposits increased 2% ex FX, as 8% growth in consumer checking and savings balances was offset by deliberate reductions in higher cost time deposits. Corporate deposits increased 7% year over year ex FX, as continued strong deposit flows led to 10% growth in transaction services, notwithstanding our declining deposit pricing during the year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In addition, through pricing actions, we reduced some higher cost deposits from our market counterparties in our securities and banking business, offset by good growth in private banking. Operating account balances increased this quarter to 80% of our total deposits, as we continue to focus on improving the overall quality of the base. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Now let me turn to slide 11, to cover our long term debt, which is the primary source of funding for our parent company, and is also a valuable liquidity management and funding tool for our bank subsidiaries. Over the past years, we\u2019ve significantly reduced our long term debt balances as Citi Holdings assets declined and our deposit base grew. During 2013, we\u2019ve slowed the pace of reductions and the aggregate level of outstanding long term debt. As you can see, we stabilized at about $221 billion during the second half of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">During 2014, we expect to maintain our long term debt at approximately these levels, so we may small reductions in parent company debt, partially offset by small increases in securitization activity at the bank. We have maintained the weighted average maturity of our unsecured debt at approximately seven years to ensure the stability of our longer term debt funding base. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">As of the end of the year, we had holding company debt, preferred stock, and Basel III tier one common equity equal to 23% of our estimated Basel III liquidated assets, consistent with prior periods, as we detail on slide 24. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">While potential regulatory debt requirements have been widely discussed, we don\u2019t yet have clarity around the exact forms or requirements, although we continue to believe we are well positioned to adapt to the proposals being discussed. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to achieve our funding cost, liquidity, and capital objectives. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Slide 12 provides further context for our debt issuance and redemption activity at our parent company. During 2013, we issued $19 billion of benchmark long term debt as well as $8 billion in structured notes and local country debt. We also exchanged $3 billion of trust preferreds for subordinated debt.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">In addition to the U.S. dollar, we issued in a range of foreign currencies, euros, Aussie dollars, Japan yen, Norwegian krone, and at maturities ranging from 3 to 30 years, as we sought to diversify our funding sources and maintain a benchmark funding curve.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Combined with our maturities of $31 billion, and buybacks of $12 billion, we had total net redemptions of $15 billion last year. In 2014, we currently expect to issue approximately $20 billion of benchmark long term debt, consistent with last year. We also expect to issue another $10 billion of structured debt and local country debt.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">In addition to $25 billion of expected maturities, we also expect to buy back or redeem approximately $10 billion of our debt throughout the year as opportunities arise to replace our higher coupon securities at attractive levels. This would result in approximately $5 billion of total net redemptions at our parent company during 2014. As we have said, the market environment, as well as clarity around NIM and debt requirements, and other regulatory developments, could alter our outlook. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">During late 2012, and 2013, we reentered the credit card securitization issuance market as we looked to diversify our funding sources at our bank after a multiyear absence. On slide 13, we outline our recent activities and our expectations for securitizations in 2014. Citi was historically a very active issuer in the securitization markets, across a range of asset classes. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">With our rapid deleveraging starting in 2009, we created cash, which in turn was used to fund our routine lending [row] and which temporarily reduced the need for securitizations. During this time, our securitization oustandings declined to $24 billion, including $20 billion of net redemptions in 2012.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Today, we find that credit card back debt is less expensive than our marginal term deposit rate, and helps us manage our liquidity position efficiently. During 2013, we issued $11 billion of securitizations, backed by Citi-branded card receivables. We structured our offerings with a focus on a balanced maturity profile and to respond to our investor preferences. Combined with the approximately $2 billion of maturities, we had $9 billion of net new issuance in 2013, and we ended the year with outstanding securitizations at our bank of $34 billion. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Throughout 2014, we currently expect to issue $10 billion to $12 billion in the securitization market, primarily backed by Citi-branded credit cards. Factoring in $8 billion of securitization, we anticipate net new issuance for the year of $2 billion to $4 billion. Last week, we issued $850 million of a 7-year fixed rate credit card securitization to kick off our issuance program for the year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On slide 14, I\u2019ll cover the size and composition of our liquidity portfolio, which is a direct result of our deposit and long term debt funding. We sized our liquidity portfolio to meet our operating needs and to withstand a variety of stress scenarios in addition to satisfying regulatory requirements.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">As of the end of the fourth quarter, we had $424 billion of high quality liquid assets, somewhat higher than the $410 billion last quarter and an average of approximately $400 billion over the last two years. As we\u2019ve said before, our HQLA will fluctuate from quarter to quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">As an example, our HQLA was unusually low in the fourth quarter of 2012, driven by cash outflows and deposits related to the expiration of the [unintelligible] program as well as routine year-end customer balance sheet changes. More recently, growth in HQLA was driven by continued deposit inflows. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Over 80% of our HQLA as of year-end is held in the form of level one assets, cash, U.S. government securities, and high quality foreign sovereigns. Just under 20% is held in level two assets: U.S. agency securities, U.S. agency MBS, and investment grade debt. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">As you know, there is a 40% cap on level two securities under the proposed Basel committee liquidity rules, which puts a real constraint on the size of the bank\u2019s agency MBS portfolio. Our level two assets represent less than 20% of our HQLA, leaving us significant flexibility to optimize our investments for both liquidity and yield. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On slide 15, I\u2019d like to discuss our liquidity ratios under various proposed regulations. Under the Basel LCR guidelines, as of year-end 2013, our LCR was 117%, up from 113% in the third quarter and representing a $62 billion liquidity cushion, above the 100% proposed minimum future requirements. Our LCR calculated on this bases increased during the quarter, principally due to the increase in our HQLA balance and improvements in the mix of our deposits.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">As you are well aware, the U.S. agency has released a notice of proposed rulemaking in October, which included several changes to the computation of the LCR for U.S. financial institutions. First, the definition of level two assets in HQLA is more limited, especially around investment grade credit. Second, the proposal changed several assumptions regarding the classification of certain deposits, debt buyback requirements, and certain repo financing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Based on our understanding of these changes under the NPR, we believe we are still in compliance with the proposed minimum requirements. However, there are other aspects to the proposal that are less clear, and we are working with the industry associations and our regulators to better understand the details. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Depending on these discussions, including the formulations of net outflows, and as our regulators finalize the proposal, we expect there could be additional requirements to the proposal, or to our estimate, particularly resulting from any further clarity regarding implementation. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Additionally, the Basel committee recently released a consultative document with updated guidance regarding the NSFR. We continue to evaluate this guidance relative to our overall liquidity position. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">There is a lot of detail to review, but our initial estimate of NSFR at year-end is in the 90% to 95% range, and we believe we should be able to close the gap under the revised guidance over the next 12 to 18 months without significant changes to our current plan. Of course, once we complete our analysis of where we are, we\u2019ll be in a much better position to judge the actions and timeframes needed to close any gaps. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Turning to slide 16, let me summarize our capital position, which remains among the strongest in the industry, as compared to both our U.S. and international banking [payers]. Our regulatory capital continued to increase during the fourth quarter, driven by continued growth in retained earnings, and utilization of an additional $600 million in DTA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">However, our estimated risk-weighted assets under the advanced approaches also increased by approximately $40 billion related to operational risk. We continue to further refine and enhance our models under Basel III, and given the evolving regulatory and litigation environment, we felt it prudent to increase our operational [unintelligible] RWA during the quarter. As a result, our estimated Basel III tier one common ratio under the advanced approaches remained at 10.5%. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">It also remained slightly lower than our ratio under the standardized approach, making advanced approaches the binding ratio for Citi this quarter. As you know, we must report the lower of the two ratios.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Our estimated SLR under the final U.S. Basel III rules increased to 5.4%, while Citibank\u2019s SLR remained in excess of 6%. As you know, the Basel committee updated their leverage ratio rules last week. Under the prior SLR guidance, we estimated that the U.S. adoption of the Basel guideline could reduce our SLR by approximately 40 basis points. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">While we are still refining our estimates under the updated guidance, we currently estimate that the revised Basel proposal could increase our SLR by approximately 10 basis points as compared to the U.S. rules. Of course, this all depends on further analysis and guidance, as well as action by the U.S. regulators with respect to the Basel committees guidance. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Slide 17 shows the composition of our tier one capital under Basel III. On a fully phased-in basis, our estimated Basel III tier one common ratio is 10.5%, and our estimated tier one capital is 11.1%, both of which are in excess of the expected minimum. Once the capital ratio rules are fully phased in, we would expect to hold up to 150 basis points in the category of additional tier one.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">As of now, we estimate that our additional tier one capital amounts to 70 basis points of RWA, meaning we are nearly halfway to filling the additional tier one bucket. To reach the 150 basis points of additional tier one by 2019, we would need to issue approximately $10 billion of additional preferred stock over the next four to five years. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">With our tier one common position currently in excess of the required levels, and given the remaining time to final implementation in 2019, we believe we can issue preferred stock at a measured pace to reach our desired capital structure.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Our estimated SLR is above the proposed U.S. regulatory requirements. We believe that continued growth in our common equity position, as well as modest issuance of preferreds, should provide ample cushion to this regulatory capital measure.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">On slide 18, let me comment on how we have positioned our balance sheet to respond to a range of interest rate scenarios. Our intention is to benefit from a rise in rates while limiting the impact of changes in AOCI on our regulatory capital position. As the economic conditions have improved since 2010, we have adjusted our interest rate position progressively, with a goal of meaningful net interest revenue growth as rates begin to rise.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">On the right side of the page, we show how net interest revenues and AOCI would change in several different interest rate scenarios. At the top of the table, you see that if interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points in a parallel shift, we estimate our net interest revenue would increase by $1.8 billion over the first year, or an 11 basis point benefit to NIM as our assets would reprice faster than our liabilities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">In this scenario, we estimate that our AOCI would decline by approximately $3.1 billion after tax, reflecting a decline in the value of our securities portfolio, partially offset by a benefit related to our pension plan. The net effect of this change in our AOCI equates to a decline of approximately 36 basis points in our Basel III tier one common ratio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Now for two other interest rate scenarios. If overnight rates were to rise by 100 basis points, with proportionately smaller changes at longer maturity, we estimate that our net interest revenue would also increase by $1.8 billion in the first year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Alternatively, if the 10-year Treasury yield were to rise by 100 basis points, with shorter maturities making proportionately smaller rate moves, our first year benefit in net interest revenue would be only $100 million, based on this static balance sheet analysis. If, however, we decided to adjust our investment portfolio duration after such a rate rise, that could meaningfully increase the contribution to earnings. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">While rising rates have the ability to reduce our Basel III regulatory capital ratios through AOCI, we would expect to recover the AOCI through both increased revenue and accretion of our investment portfolio as they roll down the curve, and in approximately 18 months.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Moving to our last line, let me summarize four major points. First, while the environment remains challenging, we continue to make progress on our execution priorities. Second, our credit trends remain favorable, reflecting the high quality of both our consumer and corporate portfolios. We manage our balance sheet efficiently, which contributed to stable net interest margin of 285 basis points for the full year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Third, during 2013 we continued to optimize our funding profile, with programmatic issuance of both benchmark debt and securitizations to support the operating needs of our parent and bank. Our 2014 funding plans are consistent with our 2013 actions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Fourth and lastly, our liquidity reserves and capital base remained among the strongest in the industry, as reflected in our regulatory metrics. During the fourth quarter, Moody\u2019s and S&amp;P acknowledged our progress by upgrading our standalone rating.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">That concludes our fixed income review. John and I would be happy to take your questions. </p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p8\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">[Operator instructions.] And your first question comes from the line of Robert Smalley with UBS. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Robert Smalley - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">A couple of questions on emerging markets and then on the funding side, if that\u2019s all right. First, thank you for the AOCI slide. My question is, in past calls we\u2019ve talked about, in some of the emerging markets, the operations. In order to maintain liquidity you\u2019ve kept local government bond portfolios. Given what happened in emerging markets in the fourth quarter, did these take a valuation hit at all? And how does that flow through? Has that been on the local level? Or does that flow through AOCI?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Eric Aboaf </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">You are right in describing our liquidity portfolios as both existing in the U.S. market, in dollars as well as in foreign sovereigns. And those foreign sovereign [AFS] portfolios, as you know, are funded by the local deposit base. If you think about kind of two time periods, the fourth quarter, we didn\u2019t see very much in interest rate moves in the emerging markets. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">That\u2019s different than what we saw about six months ago, if you recall, in the second quarter. There was quite a move up in interest rates in the emerging markets. And so as a result, when you look at our impact of OCI, it\u2019s actually in the appendix on page 33, you\u2019ll see that there are investment securities, OCI, in the bottom table, about $400 million. Most of that in the fourth quarter came about from the rise in interest rates in the United States. And there\u2019s actually very little change from any of the rate moves in foreign sovereigns, on average. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Robert Smalley - UBS </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So in the future, if that should happen, that\u2019s the line we should look at then?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Eric Aboaf </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Absolutely. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Robert Smalley - UBS </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">On Korea, could you give us a little bit more color, just characterize where the restructuring is, when do you think that would be done? What other charges do you think you might have to take there? I know a competitor of yours took a large goodwill charge in Korea. Is that something that is possibly down the road?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">We\u2019ve been in the process of repositioning Korea, probably for the last 18 months or so. And for the most part, the repositioning has to do with changing some of the target markets. We\u2019ve decided, as we described in the earnings call that we did last week, moving to a customer segmentation that is much more in line with the customer segmentation that we have elsewhere in consumer. That urban based, global mindset, call it affluent or emerging affluent customer base.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And so the repositioning you\u2019ve seen so far has been largely just the books themselves and moving to that customer mix. What we do still need to do, though, is to complete the repositioning of the branch structure, so that the branches then are more aligned, again, with that urban type of strategy. So again, as we have elsewhere, in our various countries, our branches are much more centrally focused around the larger city.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">That is work that is yet to be done, and we\u2019ve done some of that, but we really hope to begin more in earnest in this year. We haven\u2019t discussed what the potential is for the repositioning charges associated with that, but that\u2019s clearly something that we\u2019ll be talking to you about later in 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Robert Smalley - UBS </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Moving on to some of the funding details, you put in slide 32, issuance over the course of 2013, and I was wondering if 2014 issuance, if you\u2019re looking to follow a similar issuance pattern there, or if you\u2019re looking to frontload more issuance given where rates have gone down to and where credit spreads are.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Eric Aboaf </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">We\u2019ll address that in a way based on how the market evolves. We tend to be fairly regular in our issuance. You don\u2019t see quarters where we issue half of the total need for the year, nor just a billion or two, we tend to have some balance. But in truth we\u2019re going to see how we feel the first quarter shakes out, second quarter and third quarter. And I\u2019m not really in a position to share that with you now, because it\u2019s the kind of assessment that we do literally every day and every week, when we look at the market. I can tell you that we\u2019ll be active in the market every quarter, and it\u2019s just a matter of how much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Robert Smalley - UBS </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And you had also talked about credit card securitizations as a main issuance vehicle for funding the bank. Have you also reviewed, looking at the senior deposit market, as well?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">That\u2019s a good question. We\u2019ve, from time to time, taken a look at that, as well as all possible funding options. Right now we don\u2019t see a particularly good reason to access the senior debt market for the bank in particular. On one hand, deposits are our lowest cost of funds, securitizations are our second lowest, and sort of unsecured senior in the bank would be above both of those. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So economically, it doesn\u2019t seem to make a lot of sense, but maybe that will change over time. At the same time, as you know, there are upcoming rules on orderly liquidation, long term debt requirements, and up until now, our understanding is that those requirements are primarily for debt issued at the parent company. Maybe it would be issued at the parent company and downstreamed into the bank, but that bank issued senior wouldn\u2019t be particularly useful to address those requirements. Obviously we don\u2019t have the set of rules. We don\u2019t know yet, and perhaps if that changes, we\u2019ll obviously factor that in.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Robert Smalley - UBS </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">One last one, if I could, on preferreds. And thank you for giving us a rough issuance schedule. Cost of preferreds, dividends paid, have more than doubled, I guess, according to the slide, to $427 million. Given what you\u2019re looking at for issuance over the next several years, you could add another $600 million to $650 million to this and bring your annual dividend cost to over $1 billion. How do you think about that in terms of planning? When does that become too much, and how do you factor that into your long term costs?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Eric Aboaf </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">The truth is that the preferred equity that is required for any U.S. bank is 1.5% of RWA, or up to that. Obviously you can fill it with tier one common. There tends to be an advantage given where rates are, the returns on common that we can achieve to actually have that 1.5 percentage point bucket filled with preferred. So that\u2019s kind of the starting point.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I think the second part of that discussion tends to be how quickly do we want to issue preferred. On the other hand, we could issue them all tomorrow. We won\u2019t be doing that, but theoretically that\u2019s possible. And then the common equity holders would pay out that dividend, before we accreted earnings to them, and that would not be probably our objective.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">At the same time, we could wait for five years and issue them all at the very end of the time period. We\u2019re not likely to do that either. And so that\u2019s why we\u2019re kind of in this middle ground of issuing in a paced manner. We issued a good chunk last year, and in the coming year we think we\u2019ll be issuing a little less than what we did in the past year and then continue to pace ourselves over the next four or five years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question comes from the line of Mark Kehoe with Goldman Sachs Asset Management. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Mark Kehoe - Goldman Sachs</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I wonder if I could get your thoughts around the prepositioning of any debt ahead of [OLA]. And maybe also touch on the point, if you do think that [OLA] requires some sort of debt issued at the holding company, how do you think that debt could be deployed within the group and the bank level, and whether that would be through the portfolio, that you\u2019d buy some more HQLA assets, or whether you would repay [unintelligible] borrowings. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Eric Aboaf </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Let me try to share with you what I know up to now on the question of the orderly liquidation authority and the rules, or the potential rules, and then what might come out in prepositioning rules. But the challenge with answering your question is that we actually don\u2019t have rules yet. I don\u2019t know how else to say that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">That said, if you think about it broadly, because I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking, ultimately it looks like we\u2019re going to have some kind of long term debt requirement for the company, so the bank holding company. It sounds like some of that long term debt may or may not need to be prepositioned in either the dealer or the bank or other subsidiaries, and I think until we know more, we wouldn\u2019t necessarily actively move debt or allocate it or preposition it in those different subsidiaries.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I think there is a range of views within the regulatory community that you\u2019ve seen in some of the speeches. Some would argue that prepositioning a little bit of debt makes some sense. Some would say a little more debt. Seems like prepositioning all the debt has some disadvantages and not prepositioning any may not be the place that our regulators land. But we really need to see more. And as a result, we\u2019re a bit hesitant to get out ahead of something that we know is pretty ambiguous and uncertain.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question comes from the line of David [McGowan] with Morgan Stanley. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>David [McGowan] - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">A couple of followups on your LCR disclosures. Eric, I may have missed it, but I don\u2019t think you have said what your LCR looks like at the bank subsidiaries? And I\u2019m wondering if you have an estimate of what the 117 at the bank level looks like under the U.S. rules.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Eric Aboaf </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Good questions. LCR disclosure, as you saw on page 15, we had 117% in aggregate for the firm, and we don\u2019t disclose the individual subsidiaries, but you can rest assured that if we feel confident that we should run the LCR above 100% for the firm, we also feel like we should run it above 100% for the bank, and that\u2019s how we are running today.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David [McGowan] - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And the U.S. rule impact?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Eric Aboaf </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">The U.S. rule impact we\u2019ve done in aggregate so far. To be honest, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve flipped through, it\u2019s 118 pages. So we\u2019ve done the aggregate assessment for the impact of the 117, we feel like we\u2019re still in compliance, so above the minimum requirement in aggregate. I\u2019ve not done, to be honest, the bank dealer parent split, but we think that we\u2019d be within the range of where we need to be. We don\u2019t run with particularly large amounts of excess liquidity in one entity that funds another entity. And so we should be within the range of generally where we need to be.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David [McGowan] - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"> </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And you mentioned the cap on level two assets. Looking at your disclosures versus some of your peers, you have relatively high cash balances, and you teased out agency RMBS. Even with that cap, you have pretty low agency balances. Do you think there\u2019s room to optimize and generate some growth in NII as you do that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Eric Aboaf </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I do think there is some room. I think the question is when and how, to be honest. If you think about it, there are some banks out there with very large agency MBS portfolios that are way above the 40% cap, [over the need to divest]. I think we\u2019re in the opposite situation. We\u2019ve got a pretty diversified set of assets. Like you say, we have a lot of cash. You can see that on page 14. And we have a modest sized agency MBS portfolio. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">The challenge in a rising rate environment is that agency MBS are very tough to run, because you have an extension risk there, you\u2019ve got a fair amount of [unintelligible] exposure that you need to be careful about, in particular without asset class. So if you\u2019re looking for us to change the [side] of that portfolio tomorrow, I don\u2019t think that really makes a lot of sense. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">But over the next few years, and as rates move up to different levels and maybe stabilize at some levels, it\u2019s a natural asset class for us, or for any bank, to continue to invest in. And like you said, we have cash. Ultimately, it will be a choice around rates and value of relative asset classes that we\u2019ll make at the time. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question comes from the line of James Strecker with Wells Fargo.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>James Strecker - Wells Fargo </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Last week, BofA, [unintelligible] at issuing senior bank debt out of the bank, more so to help with any LCR compliance at the opco versus cost of funding advantage in [unintelligible] terms, etc. Is that part of the matrix that you guys have evaluated potential issuance out of? Or are you not concerned with that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Eric Aboaf </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And I just said, our LCR is very healthy for the aggregate company at 117% and above the requirement for the bank. So we\u2019re in good shape. We don\u2019t need to do anything particularly strenuous or different in the bank on a go-forward basis. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I think if we were to continue to think about diversifying our funding sources, which we\u2019re always looking to do, I\u2019d kind of look at the tiering of economics, because in the end we\u2019d want to do that at the lowest possible cost, to get the best kind of tenure construction. And we\u2019re still back to deposits tend to be the lowest cost, and after that, it\u2019s securitizations, which is why you\u2019ve seen us [unintelligible] back into a modest and relatively important program in that asset class.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">After that, we don\u2019t really see the need for unsecured at the bank, and we\u2019re not necessarily going to go in that direction, obviously, unless some regulatory rules change, or for some other reason. But we don\u2019t see the motivation. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>James Strecker - Wells Fargo </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Switching gears a little bit, you mentioned potentially holding up to 150 basis points above the [unintelligible] risk weighted assets in preferreds. There\u2019s some caution or consideration on our side about how much of the tier one common buffers that everybody will presumably run with would count towards that bucket too. Is it feasible that you could ultimately have a point or maybe a point and a quarter versus the full 150 basis points? Or do you think you would optimize that to the full 150 basis points over time?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Eric Aboaf </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">It\u2019s a fair question, but one that I think is hard to answer today. I think over time we\u2019re going to get more regulatory guidance, either formally or informally, as an industry, which is it really should be filled with preferreds or using common, maybe a very acceptable alternative. And then obviously we\u2019re going to have to continue as a firm, at our end, to do the optimization of can we earn, for the marginal amount of equity, enough returns to offset the preferred dividend, which we typically can. And that would encourage us then to return common equity to shareholders and then to have that bucket more closely align with a point and a half of preferreds. But I think time will tell, and we\u2019ll learn more, and obviously we\u2019ll address it over the next few years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>James Strecker - Wells Fargo </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And I guess we could apply that same answer to 2% risk-weighted assets and subdebt, [unintelligible]?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Eric Aboaf </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yeah.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>James Strecker - Wells Fargo </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And last but not least, you had mentioned some of the things you think you\u2019re hearing and we\u2019ve opined on some of the things we think we know about OLA. Any color on whether you feel there could be a specific sub hold co requirement that comes out of the rules? Or are you just in the same bucket like everybody else, waiting for the rules?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Eric Aboaf </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">We\u2019re in the bucket of everyone else, and just waiting to see the rules. And when they come, we\u2019ll obviously try to interpret it as quickly as possible and comment for you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question comes from the line of Ryan O\u2019Connell with Morgan Stanley.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Ryan O\u2019Connell - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">John, on the earnings call, you referred a couple of times to moving toward breakeven in Citi Holdings. Now, we all know there are a lot of moving parts there, but have you indicated a timeframe when you think Citi might achieve that? Are you thinking 2015, or something earlier?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">When we laid out the original targets for 2015, overall Citi, both as far as achieving the efficiency ratios that we laid out, but importantly, as far as achieving the minimum return on assets of between 90 and 110 basis points for all of Citigroup, getting holdings closer to breakeven was clearly a part of that planning. </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So we never said, and I wouldn\u2019t say, that in 2015 we will have holdings at breakeven. But, that is clearly the path that we\u2019re going down. So if you take a look at 2012 compared to 2013, in that one-year span we cut the holdings losses by about half. So we\u2019ve made some good progress as far as getting holdings closer to breakeven. </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Obviously there still is a ways to go, but we do have two years to do it in. And ultimately, what is going to drive that, and we laid it out in a four-panel chart as part of that earnings presentation, it\u2019s really going to be dependent on how quickly we can drive down the legacy legal costs. That, right now, is the big driver in that. </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Ryan O\u2019Connell - Morgan Stanley </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And my second question is, and we touched on international a bit before, but international consumer. And there too I guess there are a couple of cross currents. On the other hand, as you\u2019ve indicated, [unintelligible] is stabilizing, so at least my sense is, overall, that should help the pressure on the revenues in Asia. On the other hand, you\u2019re getting good loan growth in Latin America, you\u2019re building reserves rather than leasing reserves. </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So here\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to sort out, if we look at international consumer banking earnings on a reported basis, they were down about 10% for the full year. But if we exclude the effect of loan loss reserve releases, as you pointed out, they\u2019re actually about 2% for the year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So is it fair to assume that we should not think about material loan loss reserve releases in the future, and then secondly, that by the same token the effect of the past reserve releases ought to be tapering off? And I don\u2019t know what guidance you\u2019re prepared to give on this, but in terms of a reasonable expectation for international consumer, it\u2019s a big business for you all, low single digits growth? Is that realistic? </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Well, we\u2019ve never really laid out the growth targets from a net income point of view, and nor do we usually give forward guidance. But your observations are pretty spot on. The way I look at the international consumer right now, we have, for the most part, moved past reserve releases in the international consumer business. And so in thinking about that business on an ongoing basis, it should be one that is driven by ultimately, once we get past the stabilization of Korea, it\u2019s a business that should be driven by the drivers, to be simple about it. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">You know, you should actually see, as we grow the loans, you should anticipate - and again it depends on the interest rate environment in each of the countries - that those loans should generate additional revenue, we should get net interest revenue off of the loans. Obviously the active management fees and the wealth management part of the business will be a little bit dependent on market environment. But you should see revenue growth along with loan growth. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Along with the loan growth, then, you\u2019re going to see some need to build reserves, because as the portfolios grow, we will need to increment the reserves, not because of declining credit quality, but just because the portfolios are expanding. And then as we\u2019re doing that, we will grow those loan portfolios, again with the same credit discipline that we\u2019ve been showing. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So you can make your own assessment as to where the NCL rates are going, but we\u2019ve given some near term guidance that certainly looking out into 2014, we see that as somewhat stable as to where we\u2019ve been. So the NCLs should be somewhat stable, loan loss reserves will need to grow in association with the growth in the portfolios, but that growing portfolio should produce expanding net interest. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question comes from the line of [Pre De Silvo with Credit Suisse [ph]]. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>[Pre De Silvo - Credit Suisse [ph]]</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">If you turn to slide 12, the $20 billion of benchmark debt that you plan to issue this year, does that include any preferred stock? Or is that not part of this equation?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Eric Aboaf </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">On page 12, and I think the corresponding page would be page 11, where we have the stacked long term debt, we\u2019re only capturing the debt structure. The preferred stock is obviously an equity account instrument.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>[Pre De Silvo - Credit Suisse [ph]]</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And then if you turn to slide 17, the comments you made about up to $10 billion - I think in my calculation it came closer to $11 billion - of potential preferred [unintelligible] issue, just want to make sure that does not include any changes in RWA?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Eric Aboaf </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">That\u2019s right. The estimate we gave was based on the existing RWA. We did that because RWAs have actually been relatively flattish over the last year, within a band. And we don\u2019t expect a lot of growth, and so we thought that would be the simplest way to do the estimate for you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Thank you.

Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CFO, John Gerspach will take you through the Fixed Income Investor presentation, which is available for download on our Web site, citigroup.com. Afterwards, I will be happy to take questions joined by Deputy Treasurer Joe Bonocore. Unfortunately our other Deputy Treasurer Loretta Moseman was unable to join us this morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations, and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results and capital and other financial conditions may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our own discussion today, and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2014 Form 10-K.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">With that said, let me turn it over to John.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you, Peter and good morning everyone. We are pleased to be hosting our Fixed Income Investor Review this quarter. I would like to begin by highlighting some key points from our first quarter 2015 results on Slide 2. Last week we reported a strong quarter earning 4.8 billion while making continued progress on our execution priorities. U.S. consumer banking performed well with growth in the retail bank. International consumer revenues were flat but loans, deposits and purchase sales all continued to grow and we expect some of the headwinds in that business to abate as we go through the year. Our institutional businesses performed solidly with revenue growth in investment banking, corporate lending, security services and the private bank. And while parts of our fixed income business saw a slow start to the year, our rates and currencies franchise continue to see strong client activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Citi Holdings remained profitable again this quarter and we reduced its assets by 19% from a year earlier to $122 billion. Over the past few months we have made great progress towards divesting businesses in Citi Holdings, including the announced sales of our consumer businesses in Japan, Peru and Nicaragua, as well as OneMain financial. We expect these sales to close this year totaling roughly $32 billion of assets and we have several other active sales processes underway. Also we utilized 1.2 billion of deferred tax assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We continue to manage our balance sheet carefully, growing loans and deposits in Citicorp, while improving our net interest margin from last year. We continue to reduce funding costs and strengthen liquidity by increasing the quality of our deposits and optimizing our debt outstanding and our capital, leverage and liquidity ratios remained strong.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">On Slide 3 we show total Citigroup results adjusted for the items noted on the slide. As I noted earlier, during the quarter we earned $4.8 billion generating a return on assets of 105 basis points and a return on tangible common equity of 11%. Net income grew by over $660 million year-over-year with about one-third coming from core improvement in Citicorp and two-thirds attributable to lower legal and related expenses in Citi Holdings. Revenues declined on a reported basis to 19.8 billion but increased slightly year-over-year in constant dollars driven by 2% growth in Citicorp. Expenses declined 10 year-over-year mostly reflecting the lower legal and repositioning charges, as well as a benefit from FX translation. Our first quarter results provide a solid start to 2015. Better demonstrating our underlying earnings power and the impact of the actions we've taken to simplify and streamline our operations.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">On Slide 4 we show trends in our balance sheet. We manage our balance sheet to optimize returns, while also adapting to current and expected regulations. On a reported basis our total assets declined by $10 billion in the quarter and over $60 billion in the past year. As a result of the dollars\u2019 continued appreciation against foreign currencies especially the euro, Mexican peso and yen. To provide more meaningful insights into our underlying business trends, we have presented this slide and several others in today\u2019s presentation on a constant dollar basis. On this basis, we have held our total assets around 1.8 trillion over the past five quarters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Net loans and deposits in Citicorp each grew 3% year-on-year across our businesses. Offset by the continued wind down of Citi Holdings. Trading assets and liabilities also increased during the year, driven impart by increased volatility in OpEx and rates markets which led to increases in both our derivative assets and derivatives liabilities. We reduced short-term borrowings by nearly $20 billion in the core. In response to continued growth in high quality deposits and our long-term debt declined driven mainly by reductions of non-TLAC eligible securities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Slide 5 shows the trends in our loan portfolio. In constant dollars total Citigroup loans decreased 3% year-over-year as 2% growth in Citicorp was offset by significant reductions in Citi Holdings. Consumer loans grew 1% year-over-year with broad based growth driving a 3% increase in international consumer loans. Corporate loans grew 4% year-over-year. Traditional corporate loans in private bank volumes increased while TTS loans declined 10%, spread compression in trade especially in Asia, led us to reduce our on balance sheet loans while we continue to support new origination for our clients. Citi Holdings loans decreased 35% year-over-year driven by a $17 billion reduction in North America mortgages as well as the reclassification of $10 billion of loans to held-for-sale related to our announced agreements to sell OneMain and the Japan credit card business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">On Pages 23 and 24 of the appendix, we have updated information on our corporate credit portfolio including our energy exposures. Our total energy exposures are now $58 billion down modestly from year-end and funded loans to the energy industry was stable at nearly 22 billion, or roughly 3% of Citigroup's total loans. While we did see some ratings downgrades during the quarter 82% of our energy portfolio remains investment grade in line with our overall corporate credit exposures, reflecting our strategy of focusing on large cap multinationals. As a result of market developments and these downgrades, we build reserves against our energy exposures by approximately $100 million in the quarter. But we realized no material NCLs against the energy sector. While we are building reserves we continue to believe that our risk is well contained and we continue to expect any losses we may incur to be manageable.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On Slide 6 we show continued stability in our consumer and corporate credit trends. In the first quarter consumer credit remains favorable with a net credit loss rate of 222 basis points. In North America and Asia trends remain stable to improving and in Latin America the NCL rate increased somewhat from last quarter on a normalized basis. However, the delinquency rate in that region continued to improve which we expect to result in lower NCL rates later in the year. Our corporate portfolio also continues to see favorable credit performance. Non-accrual loans improved slightly to 40 basis points of corporate loans.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to Slide 7 we show our deposit composition. Citicorp deposits grew 3%, with high quality deposit flows across our franchise. Consumer deposits increased 2% driven by 5% growth in international markets. North America deposits were flat year-over-year even as we closed or sold roughly 175 branches over that period representing nearly 20% of our branch footprint. Corporate deposits increased 6% year-over-year as we saw continued high quality deposit growth, particularly in North America while at the same time we constrained flows of deposits with higher expected runoff rates under the LCR. Citi Holdings and other deposits declined significantly year-over-year mainly due to the agreement to sell our Japan retail bank which resulted in the reclassification of $21 billion of deposits to held-for-sale last year as well as the continuing transfer of MSSB deposits.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Slide 8 demonstrates the diversity and stability of our deposit franchise. A deposit base is geographically diverse and provides attractive local funding as we seek to match assets and liabilities by currency in each of our markets. Over 55% of our deposits are outside the U.S. We continue to work to improve deposit quality under the LCR. Our bankers understand the importance of growing higher quality deposits and working with clients to reduce lower quality deposits.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In our Consumer business our deposits which the LCR tends to value more highly have consistently had an 87% LCR liquidity value over the past year and in the Corporate business we have increased the liquidity value of deposits to approximately 66% over the past year by reducing 100% runoff balances such as non-operating deposits from financial institutions and by favoring higher LCR value deposits such as corporate operating deposits. Overall, Citigroup\u2019s deposits have a 73% liquidity value under the LCR up modestly over the past year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On Slide 9, we show Citigroup\u2019s net interest revenue and margin. Net interest revenue in constant dollars increased 2% year-over-year and net interest revenue per day seen below the bars has continued to increase steadily. Our net interest margin remained flat sequentially at 292 basis points in the first quarter and was up slightly from a year ago on improved funding cost. In the second quarter we expect our net interest margin to decline perhaps by 2 to 3 basis points, similar to the trend we\u2019ve seen in prior years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Looking to the second half of the year, our results will depend impart on the timing of divestitures including the OneMain and our Japan Retail business. We estimate that without these businesses on a combined basis, our net interest margin would be lower by roughly 7 to 8 basis points, before using any part of the associated gains to redeem high cost debt. As you can see on Slide 31 in the appendix, we continue to expect a NIM benefit from a rising rate environment. We estimate that 100 basis point parallel rate shock would increase our net interest revenue by 1.9 billion over the first year for a potential NIM benefit of 12 basis points similar to recent quarters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On Slide 10, we show the composition of our long-term debt outstanding. During the quarter, our long-term debt declined by 12 billion to 211 billion. Bank issued debt accounted for 6 billion of the reduction, as deposits increased we reduced our FHLB advances and securitizations outstandings at the bank. We now expect to issue less than $5 billion of securitizations for the year. We expect to continue to support this valuable program through a periodic issuance, but as we do not expect securitizations to count towards TLAC, we will likely reduce this balance overtime. Parent company debt declined by 6 billion during the quarter, mainly reflecting the reclassification of OneMain as held-for-sale, senior and subordinated unsecured parent debt were broadly stable in the quarter. We currently expect to end the year with total parent company long-term debt of roughly $160 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In addition to long-term debt we increased our total preferred stock outstanding to $14 billion including our offering earlier this week. As a result, preferred stock now provides nearly 110 basis points of additional Tier 1 capital.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On Slide 11, we update our issuance and redemption expectations for long-term debt in 2015. In 2015, we continue to expect to issue 20 billion to 25 billion of benchmark debt of which we issued $7 billion during the first quarter including offerings in dollars and euros. We offered an additional $5 billion yesterday toward our issuance expectations for the year. Year-to-date in addition to $5 billion of maturities, we have reduced long-term debt by 8 billion reflecting $3 billion of buybacks of benchmark debt as well as the impact of our agreement to sell OneMain. For the balance of the year we expect additional redemptions of $4 billion to $5 billion of benchmark debt. We expect the combination of new issuance, maturities and redemptions to result in an increase on our long-term debt of approximately $5 billion for the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">So far in 2015, we have issued $3.5 billion of preferred stock including the $2 billion earlier this week. We will remain opportunistic around market conditions and currently expect to issue an additional $2 billion or so of preferred in the second half of 2015. As we continue to build towards 150 basis points of additional Tier 1 capital.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On Slide 12, we update our estimates of our total loss absorbing capacity based on the FSB\u2019s November consultative document and our ongoing discussions with regulators and other industry participants. Comment letters recently submitted to the FSB focused on the proper calibration and implementation of TLAC requirements. Specifically discussions continue to focus on the appropriate level of required TLAC to achieve targeted policy objectives and the kinds of instruments that will qualify as loss absorbing capital. Comment letters also saw clarification with respect to internal TLAC requirements and their structure and made suggestions to improve the workability of the pending proposal.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">However, since November we have had no formal proposals or feedback as to our regulators stance on these issues. Accordingly, consistent with our prior estimates, we include CET1 capital, preferred stock and unsecured parent issued senior and subordinated debt with at least one-year remaining until maturity as well as a small portion of our customer related debt in our estimates of TLAC. We estimate Citigroup's total loss absorbing capacity increased to $270 billion, including the recent preferred issuance or 21% of our risk weighted assets and over 11% of our total leverage exposure. We calibrate this 21% against potential requirements of 20.5% to 26.5% depending on the base TLAC requirement of 16% to 20% combined with our potential GSIB surcharge. We continue to await formal regulatory guidance or rules.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On Slide 13, we address potential strategies for meeting TLAC requirements once rules are established. Our plans to meet potential TLAC requirements include actions to optimize our capital structure around other regulatory requirements, as well as those specifically targeting TLAC needs. First, we will meet our CET1 Tier 1 capital and total risk based capital requirements through an efficient capital structure, which implies issuance of $4 billion to $6 billion of additional preferred stock and $8 billion to $10 billion of subordinated debt by the end of 2018. Second, while the FSB proposal excluded structured notes, we are working with regulators and industry groups to address concerns cited as reasons for their exclusion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">With some revisions to the proposed requirements we may be able to increase the TLAC eligible component of this program, potentially providing as much as $20 billion of benefit. We would then generate additional loss absorbing capacity, if necessary by increasing issuance of TLAC eligible senior debt, while reducing our use of other funding sources, such as securitizations or repo to maintain our balance sheet efficiency. The right side of the slide illustrates one potential approach to addressing a hypothetical TLAC need. Assuming a TLAC requirement of at the midpoint of the FSB range or 18% of risk weighted assets and a 4% GSIB surcharge we would face a total requirement of 24.5% of risk weighted assets or roughly $315 billion. As indicated on the prior page, we currently estimate our available TLAC at $270 billion, leaving a remaining need of $45 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">For the current CET1 ratio of 11%, we would expect to retain $6 billion of additional CET1 as a buffer against ratio of volatility. We could issue 4 billion of preferred stock and $8 billion of subordinated debt and in this example we assume we could modify $10 billion of structured notes to qualify as TLAC. That leaves $17 billion of incremental senior debt issuance through 2018 or approximately $5 billion incremental per year. By issuing in multiple currencies, we can diversify our funding base and better align the currency profile of our debt with our risk weighted assets. In summation, we believe that we have a number of alternatives for addressing TLAC, but we need to see proposed rules.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Turning to Slide 14, let me summarize our capital position, which remains among the strongest in the industry. During the quarter, our fully phased in CET1 capital ratio increased approximately 40 basis points to 11%, driven by our retained earnings and approximately $1.2 billion of DTA utilization. Despite the dollars\u2019 significant appreciation FX had no impact on the CET1 ratio during the quarter. Under transition arrangements our CET1 capital ratio increased by only 20 basis points to 13.3%, as our capital generation was partially offset by the phase in of increased capital divestitures. Our supplementary leverage ratio grew to 6.4% driven by strong capital generation and preferred stock issuance, as well as the decline in our leverage exposure. Citi Bank\u2019s SLR also increased in the quarter to 6.6%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On Slide 15 we update our liquidity position. Our LCR under the U.S. rules is 111% in excess of the 100% minimum requirement. HQLA declined modestly to remain just over a 400 billion, while our improved deposit quality contributed to a modest reduction of our estimated outflows. We continue to expect the U.S. regulators to propose a U.S. version of the net stable funding ratio in 2015. We believe as we remain in compliance with the International NSFR.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Moving to our last slide let me summarize four major points. First, we reported solid results in the first quarter with modest revenue growth and positive operating leverage in Citicorp. We made continued progress towards winding down Citi Holdings and we utilized an additional $1.2 billion of DTAs. Secondly, we have actively managed our balance sheet maintaining total assets around 1.8 trillion and optimizing our assets and liabilities to support client needs and improved returns. Credit trends remained favorable across both our consumer and corporate portfolios and we have managed our funding cost to maintain a stable net interest margin.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Third, our deposit base remains a key strength as we continue to prioritize high quality deposits. Our 2015 issuance plans are on-track to support our operations and position us to adapt to regulatory changes including preparations for formal guidance related to TLAC and lastly we have continued to prepare our business and balance sheet for the ongoing evolution of the regulatory environment. Our capital and liquidity remains strong.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">This concludes our fixed income review and Joe and will be happy to take your questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p5\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">[Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Robert Smalley with UBS.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Robert Smalley</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">A couple of questions, one on housekeeping notes. Back on Page 12, when you have the potential TLAC requirements, you've got 20.5 to 26.5. In the presentation you did, at the end of last quarter that range was 20.5 to 24.5. Is there any reason for that change?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Well, at that point in time we were still in the process of estimating where we would be on GSIB. And I think that we\u2019ve now come down squarely that our estimates would put us in a 4% bucket for GSIB. So that\u2019s the additional 2% that you\u2019ve seen.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Robert Smalley</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay, great. Moving to slide on Page 31, the net interest revenue positioning slide I guess this and the question I\u2019m going to ask about reserve releases is around the idea that we\u2019re all waiting for an interest rate rise or some change in the curve, which should extensively help the NIM. And in the meantime, we are going to have to continue to drain reserve we are going to have to continue to release reserves although that\u2019s a diminishing pool.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So I guess my first question around this is, you have a number of different scenarios here, do you see one as more likely? And that\u2019s the first question. The second question is, when we look at an increase in Fed funds, generally that means a steepening in the front-end of the curve, the Fed funds to twos for the rest of the curve historically has remained flat. Is that what you\u2019re positioning yourself for?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Well, as you said several questions in there. So let me just go back to the very-very beginning and I just want to make sure that it\u2019s clear that reserve releases have got nothing to do with interest rates. So they may both be contributing to earnings but the diminishing level of reserve releases that you\u2019ve seen certainly in our books is consistent with what our expectations were going into the year and I think consistent with the expectations that we shared with you back in January. So we are in the environment that we expected to be in.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Having said that, yes, we would definitely benefit from a rise in interest rates and we\u2019ve given you which I think is fairly traditional for most people they shock it by 100 basis points. I would not want to opine at this point in time on what I would think is the most likely scenario for interest rates I think that there is enough written about that. I can tell you that we as we\u2019ve said in the call that we had last week \u201cwe\u2019re not expecting to be bailed out\u201d, by a rise in interest rates at this point in time. If we get a rise in rates it will benefit us but that clearly is not the way that we\u2019ve been planning for this year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">No, keep going Robert.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Robert Smalley</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">I was just going to say. It speaks to the geographic and product diversity of the business. But go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">No, I was going to say, so our positioning is not -- we haven\u2019t set aside a positioning thing, we\u2019re betting on a rate environment. This is somewhat the natural positioning of the business, we definitely do benefit again from a rise in rates we know that and most of the benefit that we would expect to get would be on a rate rise concentrated in the short end of the curve.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Robert Smalley</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">And if we can circle back on reserve releases, most of them in the quarter came from holdings and North American consumer business. How do you look at judging where you have excess reserves, reserves that can be released? Can you talk a little bit about the dynamism of that process? And how much more do we have left if everything remains stable, how much more do we have left between now and the end of the year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Well if everything remains stable we don\u2019t have any more reserve releases to the end of the year in our certainly in our North America consumer business because I should have released them already. So I think from a Holdings point of view the reserve releases that you\u2019ve seen is consistent with the declining portfolio, but there is some credit improvement in there but as we noted during the presentation, we greatly reduced the amount of loans that we\u2019re currently holding in Holdings. You\u2019ve seen the reduction that we\u2019ve had in U.S. mortgage levels that are in holding we\u2019re down to $54 billion worth of mortgages and so most of the Holdings releases are really coming out of the mortgage book. And again it is resulting both from credit improvement, but I think just as importantly from asset reductions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And as we noted in the call last week, we don\u2019t -- even though we\u2019re hopeful that credit quality will continue to improve somewhat during the year, we don\u2019t see where even with improvements in credit quality you're going to continue to benefit or we\u2019re going to continue to benefit from significant amount of loan loss reserve releases in our various businesses because we\u2019re also into a period now where we\u2019re looking to have growth in the underlying loan portfolios. So the two factors of growing the loan portfolio and the somewhat stabilization of credit should keep our reserve levels either steady as they are now or perhaps even require some builds later in the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">The next question will come from Ryan O'Connell with Morgan Stanley.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ryan O'Connell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Actually I'd like to focus on what you were talking about the reduction in U.S. mortgages and holdings, which is impressive. And then there is another area. But just to focus on this for a sec, so one, I assume that the pending sale of OneMain doesn't have anything to do with those numbers, right? That's totally separate?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">That is correct Ryan, that is correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ryan O'Connell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Could you give us a sense of two things? One, the breakdown between just people paying down the debt if you're selling off mortgages, I guess what I'm trying to get to is what would you see as the glide path for this portfolio for the rest of the year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">The glide path is somewhat difficult to predict, I think that if you were looking at the mortgage book, you do have to break it down to least two broad components; one would be the amount of home equity loans that we have and that is I believe roughly about $24 billion right now and that was laid out certainly in one of the slides we had last week. You see that that element of our book is really driven by pay downs because there really is no market to do asset sales in home equity loans and so I think that if you just look at the pace of asset reduction in home equity loans that gives you a pretty good view as to how we would anticipate that book coming down overtime and it's slow, it's slow.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">The remaining part of the book, the $30 billion then of first mortgages that we have there we get the combined benefit of both pay downs as well as asset sales. I don\u2019t have the breakdown in front of me of how much the pay downs were during the quarter. But there at a pace right now where we\u2019re going to get a 1 billion, 1.2 billion -- 1 billion to 2 billion of pay downs during a quarter from that. And the rest of it will come from asset sales and the pacing of asset sales is really going to depend upon the markets, the economics that are associated with the various classifications of mortgages. So it's going to be somewhat episodic.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ryan O'Connell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And then just the other thing I wanted to ask you about, John is really just to clarify something. In your slides, I think it's 11 or so, you've reclassified 5 billion of the OneMain debt. Is that just stuff you pay off at closing or does it go with the deal? I'm just trying to get the mechanics of that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Yes, in the quarter since we did sign a definitive agreement to sale OneMain and since it is a significant business we therefore re-classed all the assets and all the liabilities of OneMain into held for sale so you don't net the two but the assets come out of loans and where ever else they were and they go into other assets held for sale and the same thing on the liability side and our estimation is that those liabilities especially the liabilities that you are talking about the securitization of the debt liabilities of OneMain will go with the business at the point of sale.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">[Operator Instructions] The next question will come from Arnold Fukuda with Bloomberg.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Arnold Fukuda</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I think you mentioned that in terms of benchmark redemptions left, it's about 4 billion to 5 billion. Could that potentially include, let's say you have some high coupon TRUPS that might be redeemable at the end of this year, could that potentially include TRUPS in that number?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">While is it possible that were we to redeem TRUPS that they would be included in that number yes they would be, but I'm not going to tell you that we've got current plans to redeem those TRUPS.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Arnold Fukuda</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And then in terms of, you guys were very helpful on the last call in terms of calling out the sensitivity of your GSIB buffer that changes in the FX rates and is there some sort of sensitivity that you guys can give us in terms of, if the euro moved again, let's say, to euro parity or, say, down to 0.95, would that kind of be enough for you to shift into potentially from 4% bucket to a 4.5%?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I don't think that the sensitivity I haven't run that particular scenario the additional complexity off course is that you are not just dealing with one pair. It would be nice even if it was so simple that all I had to worry about was dollar and euro. But the 79 other institutions gushed on it aren't as simple as either dollar or a euro banks I've got banks that use a multitude currencies that are included in there and gee-whiz that makes the sensitivity calculation really-really-really difficult to do. So, I can tell you that we don't believe that the euro moving to parity would be in and of itself enough to move it to the 4.5% bucket, but it would in order to be something definitive I have to run several models including not just dollar, euro but dollar, euro, pound, won all sorts of different currencies so I apologize.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Arnold Fukuda</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And then one more, a European competitor announced a big legal settlement today. You probably can't talk about that but could you just remind us -- you had some legal settlements last year. And then along with that, you had some increases in operating risk RWAs. So can you just remind us again in terms of how legal settlements could potentially lead to potential increases in RWAs? Could you just walk us through that, what happened again last year with you guys?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I think everyone is still going through model reviews on opp risk so I can't give you the definitive path by which a particular legal settlement then would lead to increases in opp risk but obviously we are impacted both by our own legal settlements, as well as operating losses call that legal settlements that are incurred by others. And so each can have an impact but I can't tell you that it's you take this multiply it by four divide it by 10 and that's the number. So, it has an impact but I can't reduce it to a formula for you?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">The next question will come from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So, I heard your overall comments on energy. And I do note that energy prices are up like 15%-20% so far in April. With that said, I just want to -- I like Slide 24 back in the appendix where you give some more detail. The question I have is, if 82% is investment grade for the overall portfolio, how that breaks down for the oil and gas sleeve of the close to 18 billion?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">When you say the oil and gas you are talking about okay the oil and gas E&amp;P right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Correct, sorry.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So, that has been consistent that is slightly below the overall 82% that's roughly 75% investment grade and that's been fairly constant since year-end.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">The next question will come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Can you share with us you touched on the home equity portfolio in Citi Holdings going down slowly due to pay downs? Are there any ways that you see or what would need to happen for that to accelerate? Will housing prices need to rise 15% or 20% from here and allow people to refi out? What kind of scenario would you have to paint to see that accelerate that pay down?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">The truth is, is that the consumer behavior on home equity loans is less linked to changes in property values and if you recall back in, even back in 2009, 2010 many people were surprised by the relatively good performance of home equity loans compared to first mortgages and that\u2019s because most consumers treat these as just revolving credit and for a while everybody was referring to them as second mortgages and from a capital structure point of view that\u2019s true but again to a consumer it\u2019s not necessarily a second mortgage. They don\u2019t view as it being part of a capital structure. They view it as the instrument that they use to go on vacation to buy a car to finance their child education. So there is a whole different dynamic in consumer behavior when it comes to home equity loans. And again I think we\u2019ve all seen that over the last six to seven years and that continues to this day.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Can you refresh my memory the reason for them to be in Citi Holdings is more of a loan-to-value issue than anything else?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">No, it has to do with -- don\u2019t forget when we first looked at the mortgage business back when we set up Holdings, the mortgages including both the first and the seconds, the home equity loans that we put into Holdings were those that just didn\u2019t fit the strategy that we had outlined. We had acquired a lot of these mortgages not through origination through our branches or under the new credit schemes, credit regimes that we would have put in place. But a lot of these were purchased. And therefore they are the type of business that we would necessarily do again.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Shifting over to deposits, you made a good point about the value of your consumer and corporate deposits from a liquidity standpoint. And I think you said the corporate deposits have a 66% liquidity value now, which is up from last year. Do you see much more improvement there or are you at a level where you think that's where it's going to stay?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Well I do believe that we can continue to improve the overall liquidity value of the deposits but it\u2019s not going to go from 73% to 83%, can we get that 73% to 74% maybe at some point in time to a 75%, yes, but it\u2019s not going to come in leaps and bounds at this point in time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">The next question will come from David Chang with Prudential. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Chang </span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I had a question on Slide 13 on the illustrative TLAC. This 6 billion that\u2019s management buffer, what does that represent? Is that like the operating buffer on top of all the SIFI buffers?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">It\u2019s basically a 50 basis point buffer on top of what we would look at as being our estimated GSIB requirement based on our understanding of the current proposed U.S. GSIB rules.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Chang</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Right. Which could change right, the surcharge, which as you calculated now, does any part of that count towards TLAC?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">When you say the surcharge, I just want to make sure you\u2026</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Chang</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">The 4% GSIB surcharge.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yes, it should because it will be in our capital base.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Chang</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Right but if that goes down, do you lose that credit to say?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">When if the GSIB surcharge went down please dear God if it reduced from 4% to 3% I\u2019d say then that would also change the calculation of the TLAC requirement so I wouldn\u2019t need to hold the capital but at the same point in time I wouldn\u2019t have the same level of TLAC requirement.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Chang</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Then when you think about the 16 to 20 FSB guidance, are you under the assumption that each of the SIFIs will get a different number within the 16 to 20 or depending on the jurisdiction, the U.S. or another jurisdiction would just choose a number and then calibrate with the buffers?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">It is very possible that each country will come up with its own.

Is there a target you want to be at? And can you bring that LCR down to 105? I mean it's fairly inefficient to be above 100?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Well again you're looking at the absolute -- the way the rules are said. We\u2019d also run of course our own internal LCR equivalent and that is really what we manage to and I can tell you that our own internal LCR requirement or LCR like requirement is a little bit tougher than even what the U.S. rules have in place. So can the 111 come down? Yes, I think that we can optimize a bit of the 111, but I certainly don\u2019t imagine us getting down to anything below 105-107.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kevin Maloney</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And you were nice enough to give RWAs for Holdco. Can you give us RWAs for OneMain and the other assets that are being disposed of, meaning\u2026?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">No, we haven\u2019t broke -- go ahead keep going, before I tell you no let me hear the whole question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kevin Maloney</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">No, no that's fine. I asked the question. Please answer.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Now, okay we haven\u2019t broken out the RWA specifically associated with OneMain at this point in time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kevin Maloney</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And one last question, your total assets plus other off balance-sheet liabilities, you gave us some numbers and it was down Q-over-Q. I mean can we expect more improvement in that ratio for the SLR?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Well we continuously try to optimize again our total leveraged assets and so we do have active management programs in place to try to bring that measurement down. So it's hopeful that we should be able to reduce it now again, we were also hopeful that we\u2019ll be able to expand the overall business so there will be some -- hopefully some growth pressure on there. But yes, we continue to optimize both the RWA calculations and when I say that it doesn\u2019t mean that what we\u2019re trying to do is just change the way we do calculations, we try to optimize by running the business differently and so we continue to manage that on both an RWA and a total leverage exposure basis as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kevin Maloney</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I guess one last small question on Page 13 you show the customer related debt restructuring, which is I guess structured notes. And you're suggesting 10 billion could be changed, but you have much more than that. I was wondering why you picked 10 billion?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Well again this is a hypothetical, it's just meant to be illustrative and there we would look as being hopeful that we could get 20 billion, but I have to tell you I think that that is -- that\u2019s probably being optimistic at this point in time. Again we don\u2019t know anything, we haven\u2019t seen the rules. But what I would say is probably a bit more realistic as that we could get half of it back say 10 billion. So it's just an estimate.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">The next question will come from John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I wanted to ask about rates in the rest of the world. With QE starting up in other parts of the world, and half of your deposits outside the U.S., is low for longer rates in the rest of the world a potential concern for your net interest income margin. As we look out into \u201915 and \u201916 when we think just about what low rates did for U.S. banks as it was going through QE, is that something we have to kind of worry about in the rest of the world given where your deposit base is?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Again we tend to take all of that into consideration, but in general we prefer rates to be higher, low rates do give us some issues. But again it's consistent with the environment that we\u2019ve been planning for and so we\u2019re not seeing an environment that is greatly different from that which we anticipated doing into this year and as reflective of the comments that Mike and I would have made back in January about the type of environment we\u2019re looking at and our expectations that even in this type of environment, we still believe that our Citicorp businesses should be capable of low to mid single-digit revenue growth and you saw the 2% that we generated in the first quarter. So is it a concern? I wouldn\u2019t say it's a concern, it's a consideration and one that again we try to bake into everything that we\u2019re doing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And just a separate question, in terms of the fixed income results that you talked about kind of a dichotomy between rates and currencies on the one hand and the credit business on the other, have you seen that same kind of market conditions kind of persist, as we've gotten into April, that with the one business doing better than the other?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Well I don't think I'm going to talk this early in the quarter as far as where we think the markets are going will give you updates on that later in the quarter but I'd say that as of now April of 2015 is sort of looking like April of 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And any color on that kind of split within the FIG business or do you not want to go there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">No, I really don\u2019t want to get into business-by-business after the first 15 days, 14 days of the year of the months or the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And then can you help us think about what was the drag on the credit business, it was just lower issuance year-over-year what you experienced in the first quarter and why that was challenged year-over-year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Well I think we've pointed out at least I tried to point out it was really lower activity levels and across all categories of distress credit specially non-investment grade CLOs and as well as munis and these things they started at the beginning of the quarter and it kind of stayed there for the entirety of the quarter so it just was an off quarter for spread products.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">The next question will come from Brian Monteleone with Barclays. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Monteleone</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">A couple questions on Slide 13. The CET1, the management buffer, the 6 billion, to the extent that the 50 basis points is the right buffer across your CET1 ratio, wouldn't you need that buffer above whatever your TLAC requirement is to the extent TLAC ends up being like Pillar 1 requirement where if you fall below, in this example, 24.5%, that has the same implications as if you had fallen below the 11% CET1 ratio?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">That is certainly a possibility and it\u2019s -- but again in the absence of rules I didn't necessarily want to build hypotheticals and type of hypotheticals but you can certainly treat that 6 in your own individual models anyway you would like to.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Monteleone</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And then on the sub debt 8 billion to 10 billion on the left-hand side of the slide, the 8 billion on the right, I guess I look at the left-hand side is a gross number, but then the right-hand side I would assume that's a net number. Can you help me think about what the right way to think about the sub debt issuance guidance is?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">See the left side would be what we might need to do in order to get all the way up to the 26.5 and if we were just trying to get to 24.5 we're just trying to give you a menu that we might pick from then in order to get to that 24.5.

So, not net of what you have maturing over the next four years? It would have to be additional it would have to be additive to our TLAC.

So I'm not quite sure I caught the gist of your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><br>Q - Mark Kehoe</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">When looking at the standardized versus the advanced approach, whether those approaches would be across your capital structure or whether it would depend on each ratio. If so for example, if one ratio is a standardized ratio and other could be advanced ratio, depending on which is the lower ratio of the two?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Well let me try and then you tell me if I'm helping when even under the current rules right now you are constraining ratio is the lower of your CET1 ratio under either advanced or standardized that's per Basel rules. However what we have seen is that individual countries can pick and choose what they want to use you've seen the U.S. in CCAR for a while it was focused on standardized now they may move to advanced in this next CCAR so we have to calculate how are ratios under each methodology and certainly be aware of it but it's going to potentially vary from year-to-year as to what the most constraining ratio is I don't know if I'm being helpful.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mark Kehoe</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">You are. It's really to see whether you could be penalize by having a lower ratio under the advanced approach, say, for CET1 ratio, and then the other one it would be your total cap ratio could be the constraining one, would be the advanced ratio, so in a sense you operate under the standardized approach for one ratio and then the advanced approach for another ratio?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">That\u2019s not my understanding of the existing rules. They start with the lower of advanced versus standardized for CET1 and then your total capital and your Tier 1 capital are build off of that. But again I can\u2019t say that the rules wouldn\u2019t change but based upon certainly my current understanding of the rules is that lower hub is only applied at the CET1 level and then the Tier 1 and total capital ratios are build off of whatever your most constraining base is.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">The next question will come from Justin Ziegler with Aberdeen Management.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Justin Ziegler</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">You\u2019ve reflected on a little bit on previous questions, but I guess just in terms of talking about operating risk weighted asset again and I am trying to think about in terms of 2020 when TLAC and everything comes into full effect. Can you give any sense in terms of how you\u2019re looking at that and how you\u2019re looking at modeling operating risk-weighted assets as Holdings kind of goes in the review mirror. And given you global footprint, how are you kind of thinking about that in any sort of strategic moves over the next few years that might give you any relief on the denominator side?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Right now, again based upon how our understanding of opp risk and where we think opp risk is headed. It\u2019s unlikely that just disposing of the Holdings assets is going to get us immediate relief from the opp risk associated with Holdings. So when you take a look at the risk-weighted assets associated with Holdings there is about $179 billion of risk-weighted assets in Holdings. Of that $179 billion about 49 billion of that is opp risk. And our current view is that, that $49 billion of opp risk is going to be with us for some period of time. I can\u2019t tell you that it\u2019s going to be with us all the way through 2018-2019 that every dollar of it\u2019s going to be with us but right now I would believe that most of that if not all of that will be with us through at least 2018.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Justin Ziegler</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And maybe I\u2019m getting into the nitty-gritty here too much, but away from Holdings and Group, what kind of opp risk weighting assets do you have in the non-U.S. businesses? Do you have that broken out or?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">We don\u2019t go into the opp risk on the non-operating business and when we file the Q in a couple of weeks we will give you as we normally do the breakdown of what the total opp risk of risk-weighted assets are, but right now I would say of our total 1.288 trillion there is approximately about 325 opp risk RWA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">The next question will come from Don Jones with Sterne, Agee.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Don Jones</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Two quick questions and it\u2019s really more just a characterization. But Slide 31, you provide the adjustments or the expected estimated hits to accumulated other comprehensive income. If rates shifted out, say, 200 basis points, from 100 to 200, is it a hypersensitive relationship, or kind of one-to-one, or how much is the I guess evaporation of the carry trade on balance sheet has taken away the hypersensitivity for a like a jump in the rates?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Well, as I\u2019ve disclosed in the past, most of the sensitivity in OCI to -- is that what you\u2019re going after the sensitivity in OCI, are you going after the sensitivity on Page 31 that just talks about the overall 1.9 billion?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Don Jones</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yes. For OCI the 2.6 billion but if there is, say, a 200 basis point spike in rates, just as a characterization I mean I\u2019m sure you guys don't have it mapped out but like how, since we are at such a low rate environment, if there is a big spike in rates is there a big sensitivity, a hypersensitive relationship? Or just generally, not even giving a probability expectation, how hypersensitive is that relationship if rates go up from not even 100 but 200 bps?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">It\u2019s been a long time since I would have seen anything associated with the 200 basis point immediate shock in interest rates. I think that giving you the interest rate sensitivity on 100 basis point immediate shock that\u2019s what this is, it is immediate shock I think that is about as hypothetical as I would like to get at this point in time</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Justin Ziegler</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And then lastly this is really kind of a hypothetical scenario again, but do regulators have any discussions or if there been any in terms of the development of the living will talk about funding out of separate not just the bank OpCo, but other operating entities like the broker-dealer for instance?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Again I just want to make sure that I am responding to your question, as part of resolution planning one of the things that of course we need to do is to make sure that the significant entities would be self sufficient from a liquidity point of view.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Justin Ziegler</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And since the broker dealers, well and a captive broker dealers don't issue yours included, is that clearly you have talked about it internally but do regulators, I don\u2019t know how much you can characterize this but do regulators bring it up is something that they want to test it or effect this because hypothetically saying you can issue out of the broker dealers is one thing, but actually doing it is another, right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yes, we don\u2019t typically issue at a broker dealers. There the regulators haven't put any real benefit to issuing out of broker dealers. As a matter of fact if you think about it what we\u2019re being, what really is important from a TLAC point of view would be to have the senior debt issued from the holding company level. So there is no current plans to test the issuance out of individual broker dealers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">The next question will come from John Giordano with Credit Suisse.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John Giordano</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Just a couple of and a lot of really good questions asked you already. Just in terms of the structured notes or as you call them customer related debt, because you do highlight that a number of times. Is there anything -- can you give us a little more specificity in what you think you can change to actually make that eligible? And then sort of answers a little bit, but what your confidence is that you could actually make that count?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Well again we don\u2019t have final rules, so I can\u2019t tell you what my confidence level is in any specific modification since I don\u2019t know how the rules will change overtime, if they will change overtime. What we\u2019ve tried to lay out to you on Slide 12 is that when you take a look at the customer related debt based upon our understanding of the NPR that is out there only 4 billion would count. Now there has been as we mentioned, there have been a lot of the comment letters that have gone in and have been reflective on this and so I think that as an industry were hopeful that there will be some modifications to the final rule that will therefore allow us the ability to include some of this debt in the final calculation. But I can\u2019t tell you specifically what we would change because I don\u2019t know what we count, right now only four of it counts, hopeful of more.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John Giordano</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And so if the 10 that we used on Slide 13, the 10 billion was zero how do you think you might allocate that versus seniors other than preferreds?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Well again we\u2019ve laid out one hypothetical, we would have to make it up elsewhere and beyond that I am not going to go into it in a great detail as this is the hypothetical that we have been looking at if the final rules indicate that this is not good then we\u2019ll have to take a look at what the overall final rules are and then we will optimize off of those final rules.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John Giordano</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So I guess this is more of a forward-looking question as well, once the rules are finalized and are part of law, do you foresee making changes in the prospectus to either the risk factors or putting specific ballet language into a prospectus?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Again I\u2019m going to have to see what the final requirements are and then we will adjust it off of that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John Giordano</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I know it was hard one to answer, but I thought I was\u2026</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">No, actually it was pretty easy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John Giordano</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And then the last one is you talked a lot about the disposal of assets specifically at Citi Holdings, I am curious with a large seller in the market if you see yourself as a good buyer for any particular part of that or you're really just disposing of assets right now?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">No, I think you\u2019ve seen that where different portfolios of assets are in line with our strategy. We would be buyers two years ago we bought the Best Buy portfolio in our retail cards business, retail services business. This year we announced an agreement with Cosco and Visa and as part of that agreement we\u2019re in discussions as far as the acquisition of the Cosco portfolio from the company that they previously had that relationship so we\u2019re not averse to buying assets where it fits in with our strategy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">The next question will come from Michael Rogers with Conning &amp; Company.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Rogers</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Wanted to ask you, the rating agencies seemingly are going in the opposite directions right now when it comes to your senior holding company debt ratings. And welcome any comment on your part on where you think that process may end. But have you as affirmed examined the potential impact on the breadth of the market as well as the potential incremental costs for your senior holding company paper, if indeed two or three rating agencies ultimately have BBB ratings on your senior holding company debt?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">We've looked at a variety of different scenarios we don't think that that one is likely but we have looked at it and let's not again deal it necessarily in the hypotheticals right now so when you look at it certainly from the Moody's point of view it seems as though they have us on review and for a potential upgrade we're stable with Fitch we obviously have some work to do with S&amp;P but I think so does the entire industry so it is kind of where that is?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Rogers</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Are you hopeful that the recent better numbers could stable off a two notch downgrade at S&amp;P?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I don't think that a two notch downgrade is necessarily going to be something that we're dealing with S&amp;P but obviously they have to do their work and what they are facing as is Moody's is they are looking at wholesale changes to their methodology. So presumably any change that they are looking at will impact not just us but the industry in total and so just concentrating on one rating agency and one financial institution I think that's a bit myopic at this point in time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">The next question will come from Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I'm just following up on some of the commentary on Slide 13. And you've done a lot to explain all of the components there and I recognize that it's illustrative.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Maybe be not enough?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So let me just belabor it. Just following up on that structured notes issue, if the final rule were to develop in a way that maybe there was some relief but not up to the $20 billion mark, what if we were to look at the example on the right side of the page, and you couldn't do 10 but a lesser number, where is it in the capital structure that would make up the difference? Would it be in the benchmark debt?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Well again just to on unfortunately I guess this of course isn\u2019t, is debt as I thought it was, but I have to look to see where the final rule comes out. What we have laid out here is again surely an illustrative example I realize that there may be a bit of the committee to end redundancy committee but it's meant to be an example, it is mean to be purely illustrative and we will have to wait and see where the rules come out we do think that what the example should be showing is that we have several different levers to pull in which to make up whatever our current shortfall is against TLAC requirements if any we technically right now there is a scenario that says we're done and so what we're dealing with is how much more might we be required to do answer we don't know however if we were asked to hit a 24.5% TLAC requirement here is one way that we could possibly do it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">It doesn't require herculean effort on our parts in order to get this thing done. We have areas of funding right now that we currently employee in our business that don\u2019t count for TLAC and so what we would do is shift away from them and move towards levels of types of funding that are TLAC eligible. But notice me to tell you exactly what I would do I need banality as to what actually is TLAC eligible and what's really I just don't have that right now. But again if you look these are things that we clearly can do preferred stock issuance. We\u2019ve told you that we\u2019re going to be issuing $4 billion to $6 billion of additional preferred stock. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do in order to make sure that we\u2019ve got a capital stack that\u2019s reflective of 150 basis points of our RWA in preferred stock.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">We have additional subordinated debt to issue. We know that in order to get our total capital up to a 200 basis point level. So, all of these things are already in our existing plan. The additional that we would need to do to get to TLAC requirement does not appear to us to be something that is just going to be I won\u2019t say it\u2019s not going to be difficult because everything is difficult. But if it\u2019s not going to be something that forces us to dramatically alter our existing business plans or our existing way of managing our balance sheet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I think that that point is very clear. I guess I just wanted to understand sort of where the positive point of evolution could be inside this example and where the potentially negative ones are. And it sounds like the most positive one would be where in fact the TLAC requirement falls out in terms of that range. It doesn\u2019t sound like there is really much optimization left in risk-weighted assets. And then on the negative side, it would be the actual instruments and how they count towards the TLAC requirements. Is that generally correct?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">That\u2019s a generally good summation of exactly where we are.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">That concludes the question-and-answer session. Mr. Kapp, do you have any closing remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Peter Kapp</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thank you everyone for joining the call today. If you have follow-up questions please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to us Investor Relations. We\u2019ll talk again next quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference.

Today's call will be hosted by Susan Kendall, Head of Citi Investor Relations.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Ms. Kendall, you may begin.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Susan Kendall</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you, Regina. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Mike Corbat will speak first. Then John Gerspach, our CFO will take you through the earnings presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we will be happy to take questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results and capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today, and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the risk factor section of our 2014 Form 10-K.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you, Susan. Good morning everyone. Earlier today, we reported earnings of $4.7 billion for the first quarter of 2015, or $1.45 per share, excluding the impact of CVA and DVA. It was a strong quarter overall, and we continued to make good progress towards our strategic and execution priorities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">With half the year behind us, we\u2019ve remained on track to hit our financial targets in terms of return on assets in our efficiency ratio. We again achieved both positive operating leverage and strong loan growth in our core Citicorp businesses. Citi Holdings was profitable again during the quarter and we continued to wine down its assets which are down 22% from a year ago and Holding\u2019s assets now comprise only 6% of Citigroup\u2019s balance sheet. We continued to utilize DTA this quarter bringing the total to $1.5 billion for the first half of 2015 and we added $3.5 billion to our regulatory capital during the quarter even as we returned roughly $1.7 billion to shareholders in the form of share buybacks and common dividends.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Our tangible book value increased to $59.18 and our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio increased to a 11.4% on a fully implemented Basel III basis. We submitted our resolution plan to the Fed and the FDIC which details how we would resolve Citi without the use of tax payer funds or harm to the financial system, viable resolution planning is critical to our making Citi as simpler, smaller, safer and stronger institution.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">In terms of our businesses, we saw balanced performance for the quarter across our institutional and consumer segments. In ICG, we\u2019ve grown our investment banking wallet share year-to-date and our Private Bank continued to show strong rise in revenue growth.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Treasury and Trade Solutions saw a revenue growth on a constant dollar basis. And our Markets and Securities Services revenue grew from a year ago driven by rates in currencies and security services.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In consumer banking, high quality checking deposit growth improve spreads and higher mortgage originations drove revenue growth in the U.S. while we\u2019ve optimized our branch footprint to focus on seven cities. And internationally, we also grew revenue, despite continued spread headwinds with growth across investment sales, deposits, loans and purchase sales.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We\u2019ve remained focused on our expenses and driving efficiencies throughout the organization. Despite significant investments in our regulatory and compliance functions, we continued to lower our overall headcount and we\u2019re reducing both our real estate footprint and our employees in higher cost locations.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">These actions help to keep our expenses lower than they were a year ago even before the benefit of foreign exchange.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">While I am pleased with our results for the first half of the year, the environment remains challenging and unsettled. Growth forecast continued to be downwardly revised and we still don\u2019t have clarity on when interest rates will begin to rise. While some volatility may create trading opportunities, we would much prefer to see growth strength inconsistently across the developed and emerging markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">But whatever the economic conditions are we will remain focused on our clients and executing our strategy on behalf of our shareholders.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">John will now go through the deck and then we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. John?</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Hey, thank you Mike and good morning everyone. Starting on Slide 3, I\u2019d like to highlight a couple of items CVA, DVA and the prior period mortgage settlement that affect the comparability of our results to last year. Excluding these items, we earned a $1.45 per share in the recent quarter compared to a $1.24 in the second quarter 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">On Slide 4, we show total Citigroup results. In the second quarter, we earned $4.7 billion generating a return on assets of 101 basis points and a return on tangible common equity of 10.1%. Net income grew by over $700 million year-over-year driven by core improvement in Citicorp. Revenues declined on a reported basis to $19.2 billion, but increased 3% year-over-year in constant dollars. Expenses declined 7% year-over-year mostly reflecting a lower legal and repositioning charges as well as a benefit from FX translation and net credit losses improved offset by a lower net loan loss reserve release.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">The tax rate in the second quarter was 29% somewhat lower than the 31% outlook we had provided on a full year basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Turning to the first half of 2015, the total efficiency ratio for Citigroup including Citi Holdings was 56%. Net income grew by 17% year-over-year, we generated a ROA of a 103 basis points and our return on tangible common equity was 10.5%. In constant dollars, Citigroup end of period loans declined 1% year-over-year to $632 billion as 4% growth in Citicorp was more than offset by the continued wine down of Citi Holdings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Deposits also decreased 1% driven by Citi Holdings including the reclassification of $21 billion of Japan retail deposits to held for sale in the fourth quarter of last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">On Slide 5, we provide more detail on second quarter revenues in constant dollars. Citicorp revenues were up 5% year-over-year mostly driven by growth in our institutional franchise and revenues declined in Citi Holdings reflecting continued asset reductions as well as the impact of classifying our OneMain business as held for sale at the end of last quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">As a result of the HFS accounting treatment, OneMain loans are classified as other assets. As such approximately $160 million of net credit losses were recorded as a reduction to other revenue during the second quarter. This lowered both revenues and cost of credit by an equal amount and therefore had a neutral impact on earnings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On Slide 6, we show more detail on expenses in constant dollars. Citi core expenses were down 1% as ongoing efficiency savings and lower legal and repositioning cost will largely offset by higher regulatory and compliance cost. And Citi Holdings expenses also declined on lower assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On Slide 7, we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Citicorp net income grew 22% year-over-year in the second quarter. And as I just described, we generated positive operating leverage again this quarter in Citicorp with 5% growth in revenues and 1% decline in expenses in constant dollars. And for the first half of 2015, we achieved the Citicorp efficiency ratio of 55.1%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to Citi Holdings, we were profitable again this quarter with over a $150 million in net income. Citi Holdings ended the quarter with a $116 billion of assets or 6% of total Citigroup assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On Slide 8, we show results for international consumer banking in constant dollars. Net income grew 25% year-over-year driven higher revenues, lower operating expenses and an improvement in credit cost, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate. Revenues grew 1% year-over-year in the second quarter, reflecting volume growth, partially offset by spread compression and ongoing regulatory headwinds in certain markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In Latin America, we grew revenues 3% driven by modest loan and deposit growth in Mexico, partially offset by the impact of selling our consumer franchise in Honduras last year. And in Asia revenues were roughly flat year-over-year as 3% growth in retail banking revenues including wealth management was offset by lower card revenues.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Asia card loans and purchase sales both grew year-over-year by 4% and 5% respectfully but this growth was offset by lower spreads driven by continued higher payment rates and the impact of regulatory changes in certain markets. We continued to believe these headwinds will abate somewhat in the second half of 2015. Asia card revenues grew by 3% sequentially in the second quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In total, average international loans grew 2% from last year. Card purchaser sales grew 5% and average deposits grew 4%. Operating expenses declined 5% as lower repositioning cost were partially offset by the impact of volume growth, higher regulatory and compliance cost and technology investments and credit cost declined from last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Slide 9 shows the results for North America consumer banking. Net income of $1.1 billion declined slightly year-over-year as higher revenues, lower expenses and lower net credit losses were more than offset by a decline in the net loan loss reserve release.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Total revenues grew 1% year-over-year. Retail banking revenues of $1.3 billion grew 11% from last year, reflecting continued loan and checking deposit growth, higher mortgage origination activity and improved deposit spreads. Branded cards revenues of $1.9 billion were down 5% from last year as 5% growth in purchase sales and improved spreads were more than offset by the impact of lower average loans mostly driven by the continued runoff of promotional rate balances and higher payment rates. And retail services revenues were flat to last year with improved spreads being offset by the continued impact of lower fuel prices and higher contractual partner payments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Total expenses declined 3% mostly driven by ongoing efficiency savings as we have continued to rationalize our branch footprint and capture the benefits of our global scale in cards. Our retail banking results reflect the strong progress we\u2019re making in North America.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Over the past year, we have reduced our branch count by 15% to 779 branches. And at the same time, we've improved the overall productivity of our network, concentrating our resources in 70 markets and deepening our relationships with our target clients. Despite the branch reductions, we grew checking account balances by 7% year-over-year. Card acquisitions per branch were up 10% year-over-year on a same store basis and we continued to enhance our retail mortgage origination platform reducing our reliance on third parties and better integrating our operations. Over 80% of our growth in origination volumes year-over-year came through retail channels.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Slide 10 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail. Overall, credit remained favorable in the second quarter. In North America and Asia, trends remained broadly stable and in Latin America. the NCL rate improved in line with a lower delinquency rate.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Slide 11 shows the expense trends for the global consumer banking. Over the last 12 months, our consumer efficiency ratio was 54% including overall 150 basis points attributable to legal and repositioning charges. For the first half of the year, the total efficiency ratio for global consumer banking was 53.3%, down from 56% last year. We now expect the total consumer efficiency ratio for 2015 to be somewhere in the range of 52% to 53% consistent with our plans to begin gradually increasing the level of investment spend during the second half of the year, primarily in the U.S. branded cards.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on Slide 12; revenues of 8.6 billon in the second quarter grew 2% from last year and declined 6% from the prior quarter, total banking revenues of 4.4 billon were roughly flat to last year and up 4% sequentially.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2 billon were down 1% year-over-year on a reported basis. In constant dollars, TTS revenues grew 5% from last year as growth in deposit balances and spreads more than offset a decline in trade revenues. This represents the sixth consecutive quarter that we've generated both revenue and operating margin growth in TTS on a year-over-year basis. And while trade revenues continue to present the headwind this quarter, we see some early positive signs that spread maybe stabilizing. Both cash and trade revenues increased sequentially up 3% in total.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Investment Banking revenues of 1.3 billon were down 4% from last year as higher M&amp;A revenues were more than offset by lower underwriting activity as compared to a very strong second quarter last year consistent with overall market trends. Year-to-date, investment banking revenues were up 4% driven by strong M&amp;A results and we have gained overall wallet versus 2014 particularly in North America.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Private Bank revenues of 746 million grew 13% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in investments and capital markets products as well as higher loan and deposit balances. And Corporate Lending revenues of 445 million were down 2% on a reported basis. In constant dollars, lending revenues grew 4% from last year as higher volumes were partially offset by lower spreads.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Total Markets and Security Services revenues of 4.2 billion grew 4% year-over-year and declined 12% sequentially. Fixed income revenue of 3.1 billion were down slightly from last year as continued strength in rates and currencies was offset by lower revenues in spread products.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Rates and currencies revenues grew by double digits year-over-year in the second quarter as investor client activity and market volatility were improved versus last year, G10 rates was the key driver of growth. In North America in particular as we saw strong client activity and a favorable trading environment offset by a small decline in G10 foreign exchange.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Local market rates and currencies grew modestly year-over-year driven by our franchise in Asia. In spread products however, activity levels declined versus last year in credit products in particular resulting in lower revenues.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On a sequential basis, fixed income revenues declined 12% driven by seasonal factors as well as the lower rates and currency activity as compared to a strong first quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Equities revenues of 653 million were down 1% year-over-year and down 25% sequential. Our equities revenues this quarter included a charge of 175 million for valuation adjustments related it certain financing transactions. And as of today, we have a remaining exposure with respect to these transactions of less than a $100 million. Excluding the adjustments, equities revenues would have increased by 26% from last year, driven by growth and derivatives, improved trading performance EMEA and strong client momentum in Asia.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">In Security Services, revenues were up 7% year-over-year and 3% sequential reflecting increased activity and higher client balances. Total operative expenses of 4.8 billion grew 2% year-over-year as higher regulatory and compliance cost were partially offset by ongoing efficiency savings and the impact of FX translation and credit was a positive in the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On Slide 13, we show expense and efficiency trends for the Institutional business. Over the last 12 months, our efficiency ratio was 57% including roughly 140 basis points attributable to legal and repositioning charges and our comp ratio was 27%. We continued to expect to achieve a total ICG efficiency ratio closer to the mid-point of the 53% to 57% target range for the full year 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Slide 14 shows the result for the Corp and other. Revenues were higher year-over-year and sequential, driven mainly by gains on debt buybacks as well as real estate sales in the recent quarter, partially offset by hedging activities and expenses were down, mainly reflecting lower legal and related costs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Slide 15 shows Citi Holdings asset which totaled a $116 billion at quarter end, down 22% from a year ago. We have continued to make great progress in winding down these assets. During the quarter, we closed the sales of our consumer businesses in Peru and Nicaragua and we have signed agreements to sell an additional $32 billion of assets including our consumer businesses in Japan, Egypt, Costa Rica and Panama as well as OneMain Financial.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On Slide 16, we show Citi Holdings financial results for the quarter. Revenues of 1.7 billion declined by over 300 million from last year, driven by the reduction in assets as well as the impact of classifying our OneMain business as held for sale at the end of the quarter. As I described earlier, as a result of the HFS accounting treatment, approximately $160 million of net credit losses were recorded as a reduction in revenue during the second quarter. The HFS treatment had no impact on expenses which declined 13% year-over-year, primarily due to the asset reductions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On Slide 17, we show Citigroup\u2019s net interest revenue and margin trends. The bars represent net interest revenue per day for each quarter in constant dollars, showing a consistent growth trend year-over-year even as the contribution from Citi Holdings has continued to strength.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Our net interest margin increased sequentially to 295 basis points, driven by a higher than expected contribution from trading NIM which can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. Excluding this impact, our net interest margin would have been closer to 291 basis points and we expect to maintain roughly this level for the third quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Looking to the fourth quarter, our results will depend in part on the timing of divestiture including OneMain at our Japan retail business. We estimate that without these businesses on a combined basis, our net interest margin would be lower by roughly 7 basis points before using any part of the associative gains to redeem high cost dept.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We believe we can ultimately mitigate more than half of this NIM pressure through a combination of the upcoming debt redemption actions as well as the April acquisition of the Costco portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On Slide 18, we show our key capital metrics on a fully implemented Basel III basis. During the quarter, our CET 1 capital ratio improved to a 11.4% driven by retained earnings and DTA utilization. Our supplementary leverage ratio improved to 6.7% and our tangible book value grew to $59.18 per share.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">In summary, we continued to make progress in the second quarter with revenue growth and positive operating leverage in Citicorp, lower legal and repositioning expenses and continued favorable credit trends.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">For the first half of 2015, we are tracking well to our financial targets with a Citicorp efficiency ratio of 55%, a Citigroup ROA of a 103 basis points and a return on tangible common equity of 10.5%. Of course we would expect our results to be stronger in the first half of the year given the seasonality of our markets business. But for the full year, we continued to expect to deliver a Citicorp efficiency ratio in the mid 50% range and a Citigroup ROA of over 90 basis points.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Finally, we ended the quarter with a strong capital position improving our CET 1 ratio to a 11.4% and our supplementary leverage ratio to 6.7% even as we returned roughly $1.7 billion of capital to shareholders in the form of buybacks and common dividends this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Turning to the second half of this year, we continued to expect modest revenue growth in Citicorp. In consumer, in North America, we expect continued underlying revenue growth in our retail banking franchise, although comparisons for the prior year will be impacted by certain onetime items that benefited our mortgage business last year as previous disclosed. And the North America cards, revenue will likely remain under pressure in the second half of the year as it will take some time for our incremental investment spend to drive top line results.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">In international consumer, we continue to believe we can generate revenue growth and positive operating leverage year-over-year in the second half of 2015, driven by continued modest growth in Mexico as well as continued volume growth and abating spread headwinds in Asia as we begin to lap some of the spread compression and regulatory changes we absorbed last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Turning to the institutional franchise, we continued to see good momentum across Corporate Lending, Treasury and Trade Solutions, Security Services and the Private Bank which together generated 8% year-over-year revenue growth in the first half of the year in constant dollars.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Investment banking revenues will depend in part on the overall market, but we continue to feel good about the strength of our franchise generating 4% year-over-year revenue growth in the first half with overall wallet share gains versus 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">And finally, in markets we expect our overall performance to reflect the market environment with the goal of continuing to gain wallet share with our target clients. In Citi Holdings we remained focused on winding down the portfolio, while staying above breakeven.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">As I\u2019ve described earlier we have signed agreements with a sale of $32 billion of assets virtually all of which we expect to close by year-end. And in particular, we continue to work towards a late third quarter sale of OneMain financial. We expect credit cost to increase somewhat in the second half of the year driven by loan growth as well as lower loan loss reserve releases and we expect to keep balance sheet discipline staying at or below our current size.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">And with that Mike and I are happy to take any questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p6\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Hey good morning, guys.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Hi. Thank you, Jim.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">May be we could take a little bit just about the expense trajectory from here, you highlighted higher regulatory expenses in some investments in U.S. cards, but maybe you can kind of give us, but you\u2019ve also haven\u2019t seen much of a decline in markets expenses in the corporate bank yet, seasonally we should expect some decline revenues. And then layering - maybe layering on top of that date on single operating platform in the global retail business and what that could mean for expenses longer term? Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Lots of mouthful Jim, okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Yeah.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">It\u2019s alright, that\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll try to take it one at a time. As we\u2019ve said we\u2019re really focused on operating Citicorp towards an efficiency ratio and so we\u2019re committed to operating Citicorp overall in an efficiency ratio in that mid-50% range for the year. And so that\u2019s you know \u2013certainly near term that\u2019s what you should expect us to do.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Regarding some of the items that you mentioned, I do think that as we get further into next year, certainly we begin to see some of the regulatory cost growth, those trends begin to abate. So we think that we are towards the end of that growth cycle, but that\u2019s something really for 2016 story, I don\u2019t see that for the second half of this year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">As for everything else, we\u2019re focused on being the most efficient that we possible get can, we\u2019ve given you the efficiency targets for those different businesses. And certainly in a different rate environment, we would certainly expect our efficiency performance to be even better.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">But ex-rates you would say 55 is sort of your steady state?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">You know we said mid-50s for this year, could we do something more sure, but you take a look at the progress that we\u2019ve made already, we\u2019re operating Citicorp at 55%, we\u2019re operating Citigroup overall with an efficiency ratio of 56%. I\u2019d say that to date we are certainly well ahead of what most of our peer institutions have been able to do. So I feel pretty good about the work that we\u2019ve already done and while, we can continue and we always will continue to get better. I don\u2019t know that we want to get much better. We do want to make sure that we\u2019ve got enough power to make important investments in those Citicorp businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Now that\u2019s fair. And then maybe one just accounting question on the DTA you used 1.2 billion last quarter, it seems like that dropped the values using up 300 million this quarter, yet looks like North America net income was pretty similar to last quarter, why the balance, why not using more DTAs this quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Well the answer there is three initials OCI. When you take a look at what happened on the available for sale portfolio which some of their rate rise that we had, OCI ended up impacting us. If you take a look at the contribution from earnings, the contribution from earnings on DTA was roughly similar to the first quarter both Citicorp and Citi Holdings combined to use roughly $800 million of DTA in both the first and the second quarter, but the difference in the way the two quarters pan out really has to do with OCI.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay, that\u2019s helpful, thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Not a problem.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Your next question will come from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Hi. Thanks very much. First one is just the timing and the puts and takes you mentioned OneMain be in the late third quarter hopeful. Can the debt repurchase coincide with that, how long of a delay there and then also Costco coming in. I am just more of timing the good guidance you give us on the puts and takes on the NIM in the back half and going as a next year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Yeah, I mean you know Glenn, what we\u2019re working to would be to do the best job we can of matching up the cost of the debt buybacks with the gain recognition on OneMain, that\u2019s a very much our focus and that\u2019s what we are going to try to do.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And then as far as Costco, you know as we\u2019ve said that contract is due to kick in April 1<sup>st</sup> of next year, so that will be something towards the second quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Great, I\u2019ll look for a simple clarification on the equities and the 170 as I think you said charge on the valuation side, what were you financing, why is get revalue, I am just curious of the mechanics, I understand that it\u2019s not going to repeat I hope?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">No, these are just financing transactions that result from the processing and funding of client treating activity primarily on our prime brokerage business. And the charge that I mentioned was related to a very limited number of financing transactions where we just felt that was necessary, they were just the value of collateral to reflect the current estimate of its liquidity characteristics.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Is that - is that means there is some realized losses related to PB balances because it\u2019s a - actually don\u2019t think I am in real \u2026?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">No, no, no - no, no, this is not they do is realized losses at all. As matter of fact I would say that given what we know today based upon everything that we\u2019ve got, what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve just took an appropriate and a prudent charge to revenues. We continue to work with the parties involved and so this is still very much a work in process. As of today all the promise payments have been made on schedule and we anticipate that these financing transactions will be resolved hopefully over the next several weeks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And to your question is as long as the remaining schedule payments are received, we will not realize a loss and therefore the charge that we\u2019ve actually taken would actually be reversed back driven.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Good, here is a last one. I thought given all the volatility and pick and your EM heavy franchise, the local markets franchise, I thought the performance is good concerning all the disruption late in the quarter. I am just curious, was there disruption late in the quarter and the things that happened late in the quarter, have we seen a reversal of any of that so far in July?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">You know I\u2019d say we had a couple of periods of disruption during the quarter that we manage to work our way through. And I think it\u2019s a little bit early right now to make comments on the overall tone what\u2019s rating will be for the balance of the third quarter, but we managed to work our way through a series of events.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Alright, thanks a lot John.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Alright.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Good morning, John.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hi.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Just to clarify, you guys sort of adjusted the GCB target for the full year versus last quarter but is there any impact to your target that you are shooting for to exit the year or does that still remain in the previous rate?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">No, the - what we would say is we haven\u2019t adjusted the target. The target is remains that we believe that business should be able to operate it in an efficiency ratio of 49% to 52%. However given where we are in this year and given the fact that we do want to begin to put some additional marketing spend against U.S. branded cards in the third and fourth quarter which we think is the right thing to do from a top line - future top line growth point of view. The overall efficiency ratio for the business for this year is likely to be slightly higher than 52% somewhere in that 52% to 53% range.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">We\u2019ll give you guidance on next year and where we expect that business to be when we are talking about the third and the fourth quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay, thanks for that. And I know that sequential quarter doubt is can be somewhat difficult, but is it possible to provide some color on what drove the pickup in Citicorp expenses quarter-over-quarter on a constant dollar basis and maybe the quarter-over-quarter uptick in quarter efficiency for GCB?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yeah, most of the expense increase that we are seeing really has to do with pressure coming out of regulatory and compliance types of cost. I think that\u2019s something that you are probably here throughout the industry at this point in time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay and those regulatory and compliance costs are captured in the quarter expense as opposed to be considered legal and repositioning right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Absolutely.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Perfect.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">They are in our core operating expense and everything is in our efficiency ratio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Got it, got it. And so is that way you guys highlighted on the expense front in international GCB that you had the up west from volumes but you didn\u2019t see that translation into revenue, is that because of that regulatory headwind?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Well that\u2019s not the - that\u2019s not an expense headwind but that is a different type of regulatory headwind. As I think I mentioned in the past, what happened in Asia especially last year and it continues somewhat into this year, almost every country has passed some form of what the U.S. did back in 2010 with the Card act and so they put in a series of debt caps and interest rate caps. So those are headwinds that are impacting us on a revenue point - from a revenue point of view and we now believe, we do believe that those spread headwinds are beginning to abate particularly in the second half of the year as we lap the imposition of those new regulation. But that\u2019s what\u2019s impacting us on the revenue line. That\u2019s a little different from the other regulatory and compliance headwinds that we faced on the expense line.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay, terrific. Last question from me, thinking about Holdings and the North American mortgage book, as of last quarter, about 24 or so billion of the 54 billion mortgage was second lean which is might saying that it\u2019s basically not market above, so I am just kind of curious of the remaining roughly 50 billion of mortgage that is first lean. How much of that do you carry the core responding second lean on your balance sheet and therefore you probably wouldn\u2019t want to sell those mortgages to put yourself kind of orb yourself negatively in the structure, I just trying to think about sizing what\u2019s left to sell in mortgage?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">You know Brennan I don\u2019t have that particular figure either with me or in my head, so I can\u2019t answer that question for you right now. We do have as you can see later in the deck, of the mortgage that remaining 51 of mortgages, about 23 of that is home equity. And as you can see that\u2019s declining at a fairly steady rate of about $1 billion a quarter. Obviously we\u2019re going through the reset period now \u201815, \u201816 and \u201817 are the year where virtually about 13 billion of 12 billion of that portfolio go through rate reset. And the rate resets are performing well now. What we\u2019re hopeful of is that the market begins to get a sense that the rate reset issue is not really a big detuned that perhaps a market for home equity loans will open up if not later this year then perhaps earlier mid next year. And then that might give us the opportunity to work down those balances in home equity loans at an even faster rate.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thanks a lot for all the color John.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Not a problem.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question will come from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Hi Matt.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">The color on the NIM - the color on the NIM in terms of OneMain and some of the houses was helpful. Just as I just try and put all together and thing about the earnings impact and the capital impact of those three things, one there in Costco debt restructuring. Any color there you can give us?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">No, I really haven\u2019t put the whole capital impact a story of each of those things into my head, so I apologize for that. Obviously we are not doing, OneMain is something that we\u2019ve focused on for some period of time, so that is all part of the holding story and trying to continue to wind down holding, so we would look at that as something is exiting a what is really a good business but if one that just doesn\u2019t fit with our strategy and Costco we continue to believe that that is something that will be accretive to next year. So we feel well about that. But I can\u2019t link the capital story for you of those three separate things, I am sorry Matt.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay, are the earnings impact, you said past that a way is to have the NIM drag but obviously there is some credit cost and expenses and things like that especially to OneMain as well?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yeah, OneMain you know again, OneMain is part of Holdings. You know what we are trying to do with Holdings and our target for Holdings is to remain above breakeven. OneMain certainly is a contributing of significant contributor to Holdings profitability but it\u2019s by no means the only profitable business that exists in that portfolio. And so we continue to believe that we can even with the disposition of OneMain, the earnings of the remaining portfolio plus the effect of the ongoing expense reductions as well as the continued retirement of high cost funding and we\u2019ll have other episode of gains and losses. So we think that that will enable us to maintain Holdings into next year at no worse than breakeven on an annual basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay and then just within North America retail banking you mentioned that passes spreads for improving and that was a key driver of the revenue. What\u2019s driving their deposit pressure that just mix of what is that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yeah, we\u2019ve been - if you take a look at our overall focus on deposits, deposit quality and cost of something that we\u2019ve been focused on for the better part of two plus years at this point in time. We see a definitive tradeoff as far as what you can do to be able to optimize your deposits. When it comes to optimizing deposits, we look at both making sure that we are improving the liquidity value of the deposits as well as then optimizing the cost, but there is a lot of situations where we\u2019re actually willing to pay more for high quality deposits if it gives us the ability then to shed low quality non-operating deposits.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">The whole - this whole topic of non-operating deposits is something that again we\u2019ve been focused on now for five, six quarter and we\u2019ve been steadily driving down our non-operating deposits. You know that\u2019s benefited us both from terms of a liquidity point of view and I think from and our ability then to overall fund the franchise.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay, thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">You next question will come from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Hi. With regard to your efficiency ratio, you are at 55% for Citicorp, you mentioned the growth and some of the regulatory growth should abate next year and you also said it should be better if and when interest rates go up, so and you saw project Rainbow actually if you give an update on that? So where should the long term efficiency ratio go and at what point would you think about being more aggressive with that target and again an update on project Rainbow?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Mike I think a lot of and John touched on it a bit where we go with our efficiency ratio is going to be function of the environment. We would be pushing towards in a rising rate environment. Obviously we\u2019ve talked about our sensitivity the rates and the impact in terms of revenues and our belief that we could get a lot of those revenues to the bottom line as rates begin to come up. And so we\u2019ve tried to be mindful, we said when we set to mid-50s that was predicated on a low to mid-single-digit revenue growth environment which is unfortunately proved to be the case as that revenue environment changes we would adjust our efficiency of that again trying to deliver positive operating leverages a result of that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And what about your ROA target, I mean you added over 100 basis points low and is 90 basis point. At what point would you consider increasing that target and I am not saying to do away with the concrete targets over a concrete timeframe but for next year or long term normalize so where should the ROA be?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">You know Mike, let me just jump in for a second because I think it\u2019s going to be hard for us to give a long term guidance as far as return on assets until we get more clarity around some of the regulatory rules that still need to be set including especially the TLAC. So it\u2019s possible that all financial institutions including us might actually as a result of TLAC, we force to put on levels of debt that would serve no other purpose - no other purpose but is certainly serve the purpose to end up grossing up our balance sheet which could therefore inhibit any bank\u2019s ability to improve ROA. So before we give longer term targets on ROA, we\u2019d like to see the rules under which we\u2019ll need to be operating.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And then just going back to my earlier question, one factor that\u2019s more unique to you guys project Rainbow as you consolidate your systems, you think it had more efficiency gains from that how much you are going to reinvest some of the savings, where do you stand with that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">You know Rainbow continues on its path of implementation, we continue to go live in countries around the world. And as we\u2019ve talked about historically when we launched Rainbow, we launched it with the premise that it would be an expense savor for us and in essence have rationalized the target that. What we\u2019ve seen is a combination of not just expense save but also some revenues gains as we\u2019ve got the system in place. We\u2019ve talked about from timeframe perspective, we continue to roll that out and fund it organically. And so work in progress but the result so far are quite positive.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Alright, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thank you, Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question will come from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Hi this is [indiscernible] on for John.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Hi.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Just had a quick question on revenues, the revenue in corp other has jumped up a little bit last few quarters and I know you mentioned some gains. So just if you could talk a little bit about what level at you are a little bit more sustainable at?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yeah, I think that you know longer terms you\u2019d probably expect Corp other revenues to be something in the 100 to maybe 200 range, so somewhere maybe even 150 to 200. So this is at somewhat higher levels right now. And we noted the fact that it included some gains on the sale of real estate and continued debt buybacks. Debt buybacks, the hedging activities that\u2019s all what we consider to be normal type of activity that could go into Corp other.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">The sale of the real estate gains and that generated about a $140 million of gains this quarter. So that\u2019s what I think you are really seeing is pumping up Corp other.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Alright, that\u2019s helpful, thanks. And then somewhat follow-up, looking at international consumer loan growth, it looks like trends are pretty good, ex-Korean, just wondering sort of what your outlook was there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">For international consumer or for Korea, I just want to make sure.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">For international consumer more broadly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. Well again we think that the drivers that we have in that business continue to reflect pretty well on the strength of the franchise. We would continue to expect to see both growth in deposits and average loans. And hopefully investment sales will continue, obviously investment sales are somewhat depended upon the overall state of the markets. And as I mentioned, we\u2019ve gotten I think reasonable - in the current environment reasonable growth coming out of the retail banking piece of the franchise. We had 3% revenue growth this quarter. We need to get the card\u2019s franchise back contributing and that\u2019s really more matter of just being able to lap those regulatory changes and make sure then that we\u2019ve seen the abatement in the spread pressure that we\u2019ve otherwise been facing, which is why we are more confident on the revenue growth of that franchise going into the second half of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Alright, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Not a problem.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Hi, good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Hi Steven.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Hi. John I had a one quick question on capital. I was hoping you could give us some inside or incremental color on what contingency plans you might have in place if the Fed were to incorporate GCB surcharges in CCAR, just given that it could have a pretty meaningful impact on your return profile as well as your payout capacity?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yeah, if the - let me approach it this way, one, if that would have to happen it would impact the entire industry not just us. So we\u2019d really have to take a look at what the entire industry response is.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Secondly, it will depend upon what GCB surcharge they were to add to the CCAR requirements. I don\u2019t know how the GCB surcharge will be calculated, I guess we\u2019ll all find that out Monday and that should be informative. If they give us the opportunity, if they come up with a GCB surcharge that we can actually manage and therefore take effective actions against then certainly part of our action plan would be to really focus on managing down our GCB surcharge.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thirdly, if they were to add the GCB surcharge into CCAR, I don\u2019t know what changes they might also make in the CCAR process itself. Don\u2019t forget some of the things that they build into CCAR such as the market shock actually serve the purpose of putting more stress on the larger institutions already. So you would think that if they were going to put the pressure on the capital then to be fair, they might take some of the pressure of the CCAR calculation themselves. So there is a lot that is unknown about what may happen and so contingency plans at this in time are somewhat dependent upon the scenario in which we\u2019re ultimately dealing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I understand. I appreciate that color John. And maybe just one more picky question on DTA, I did appreciate the color you had given surrounding the AOCI impacts of weighing on the pace of consumption. But just wanted to get a sense as to what drove the increase in the net operating losses, just given AOCI hedge are typically a timing DTA as you and it did increase by north of 500 million which is not immaterial?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">No. No, no, no, you\u2019re absolutely right. What the - that roughly 500 plus million dollar increase that you see in the back of the investor deck during the second quarter was actually cause by a $900 million in state and local net operating losses. That all resulted from audit settlements that we concluded during the quarter. So that influx of the state and local NOLs was partially offset by the utilization of roughly $500 million of FTCs in the quarter and the difference is it has to do with the general business credits. But the NOLs that we added in as a result of the audit settlements have got a 20 year life on them. So we\u2019ve got every confidence in the world that we\u2019re going to be able to generate use of those that $900 million of NOLs. And importantly the FTCs that were utilizing or the FTCs that will actually near term expiration dates in \u201817 and \u201818.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay, thanks for clarifying that John and thanks for taking my questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Not a problem Steven.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Hi, good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Hi Betsy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Just a follow-up question on the expense ratio and just a little bit of different angle on asking about the consumer where you\u2019ve indicated that for the near term the expense ratio would rise as you are reinvesting in the business. I know just you didn\u2019t change the overall company expense ratio, so just wanted to see if what you are saying is you\u2019ve got other cost saves even further ahead of plan happening elsewhere in the organization that\u2019s funding, this investments spend in consumer or you are saying we see good payback relatively good timeframe and as a result we\u2019re just going to let this rise up a little bit as reinvesting, we\u2019ll get it back next year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yeah, I\u2019d say it\u2019s some combination of all of that Betsy. When we take a look at trying to manage Citi, overall Citi to an efficiency ratio, it\u2019s very much as you say we\u2019ve got several things to look at, the performance of the ICG which from an expense point of view, even at efficiency ratio point of view this year has been quite good. We\u2019ve got consumer which has made great progress on its expenses but with the performance of the ICG and the performance of other things that we see in some of the staff functions, we feel that we\u2019ve got a little room then to let consumer and run this year at slightly higher efficiency rations and still bring the full firm in at our overall target.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And we thing that letting consumer go a little bit higher in this year especially because of some higher levels of marketing and investment spend will actually then have much better payoffs in the future exactly as you outlined.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And so when you are thinking about where you putting your incremental dollar to work, as you as considering the best place right now?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">We\u2019re very focused on U.S. branded cards. We think that U.S. branded cards is an excellent business. And consumer overall we think gives us excellent returns, we obviously have a lot of things going on with Rainbow and what not, so you don\u2019t want to overload activity into anyone area, but focusing specifically on branded cards, we think that there is good payback to begun from branded cards. As a matter of fact well all the investment that we\u2019ve made in order to I think that Jud and his team have done a great job as far as completely restacking the product offering that we have in U.S. branded cards in order to get the maximum amount of the work that they have done, we need to put a little bit more marketing dollars at work.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And then just lastly on card, you indicated that you are likely to get back some of the NIM compression from some of the - from the exists impart from portfolios like Costco, you know it\u2019s - you know understanding that there is some other portfolios out there that could be of interest to, could you just give us a senses to how you are thinking about, what kind of financial hurdles and goals you have in mind when you are looking at portfolios for purchase?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Well, we look at each portfolio standalone. We understand the targets that we\u2019re working towards. And it\u2019s not just a matter of looking at a portfolio and seeing does it make economic sense, it has to be a portfolio that really fits in with the business, that\u2019s one of the reasons why Costco was so attractive to us just because of the incredible client strength that they bring and it meshes is very well with the client profile that we\u2019re looking at. So for us Costco was a natural fit, other portfolios may not have that same good client mix.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay, thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Erika Najarian</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Hi good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Erika Najarian</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">My question is on how your best in class capital ratios particularly on the leverage is impacting your client conversations in markets. Do you get a sense that some of your competitors that held for example a much lower SLR and therefore have a less balance sheet to give are being less aggressive with in terms of competing in market or not really as competition really as curious as ever and the leverage ratio differences aren\u2019t really making an impact?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Erika, it is Mike. I would say that competition is fear so I am not going to dismiss that. But we don\u2019t have some of those same constraints and I would say we probably see it more pronounced in Europe where the European banks by enlarge our constrained by their leverage ratios. And I think we\u2019ve been able to consistently be in front of our clients and smartly trying to use our balance sheet with them which obviously drives the ancillary revenue. So we have seen that and have tried to take advantage of that as an opportunity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Erika Najarian</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Got it and just a follow-up question. John, the way you sort of answered Steven\u2019s GCB question on the CCAR, I am assuming also that until we get final rules in TLAC, we won\u2019t see you guys lagging in any potential issuance ahead of having the rules finalize in the U.S.?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">You know we\u2019re continuing to do debt issuance if that\u2019s request and obviously we\u2019ve matter of fact when we take a look at the amount of preferred and the amount of debt that we issued last question, I\u2019d say was quite substantial. We issued roughly - roughly we issued $2 billion of preferred, we did $3 billion of sub-debt and we did $5.5 billion worth of senior debt. So we did $10.5 billion worth of issuance last quarter and of course we also bought some debt back but overall we were in net issuer of 8 plus billion dollar worth of offerings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Erika Najarian</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And based on how you are understating the proposals, could you give us a range on what your TLAC is at the end of the quarter, the TLAC ratio?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">We\u2019ll give you more guidance on that next week when we do fixed income call, but the numbers that I\u2019ve seen would suggest that our TLAC ratio now is a - instep a little bit over where it was last quarter, I think we\u2019re at 21.3% as of the end of June, but we\u2019ll form up all the numbers for you when we do the fixed income call next week.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Erika Najarian</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Got it, thanks so much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Not a problem.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Good afternoon, gentlemen, thanks for taking my calls - my questions. John, just a question on the U.S. branch system, that\u2019s down about 15% year-over-year, however you\u2019ve got sort of expense reductions at least for part of this expense reduction is down about 3% year-over-year, is there more to go in terms of the U.S. branch count or are you pretty much done with that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I\u2019d say we\u2019re pretty much done. There is still probably some slimming that we could do as far as completing the focus of the branches on the seven focus cities. I think we\u2019re a little over a 90% now of branches that are in our seven focus cities. So there could be some additional but I think also importantly there is probably some case to made for opening up some additional outlets in some of those cities as well just to make sure that we\u2019ve actually got the proper coverage.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I used the term outlet as opposed the branch because I am not sure that in the future every outlet that we open will look like one of the branches that are out there today. It\u2019s much more likely that the branches of the future will be somewhat smaller in line with the fact that many more of our customers who are transacting with us by alternate mean is using mobile banking and the Internet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And then from my follow-up, just a question on your comment in terms of investment banking taking market share, it sounded like you were taking more market share in North America perhaps then at least in this quarter than you did in outside the U.S., is that also true in the markets business because a number of other banks this quarter have implied that they continue to get market share at least on the market side of the equation outside the U.S. to a greater degree than they are getting it in the - within the U.S.?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">You know you take a look at market in wallet share on any individual quarter. We try to look more at market share in longer term trends. We are continuing to add market in wallet share especially against our focus clients in both investment banking as well as with our markets business. And we see that as a strength of our franchise but I can\u2019t tell you whether we actually took market share in a particular business during the quarter. I don\u2019t track it quarter-to-quarter, I tend to look at more trends on a trailing 12 months basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. And then just finally, you did 26% increase in equity markets if we exclude the valuation adjustment. How much of that was the result of improved activity in Asia?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">A very piece of it that stem from Asia, Asia was one of our primary engine for growth. I don\u2019t have the percentage in my head but it was - it was the primary driver.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Great, thanks very much John.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Not a problem.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Thanks very much. John, just a couple of clarification questions please. One, I just want to make sure on the efficiency guidance for GCB, was that new guidance than what you had previously stated?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I believe it was.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. And so can you just repeat that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Previously, just to be clear, I believe that the when I spoke last quarter we would have said that we thought that GCB would be end the year with have an efficiency ratio for the full year near the top end of the range that we had set out the 49% to 52%. But with the some of the incremental spend what we are looking to do particularly in U.S. branded card that\u2019s going to knock that just slightly above. So that\u2019s why I wanted to make sure you were aware of the fact that it\u2019s likely to end they have for the full year an efficiency ratio slightly above where I would have said at the last time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Got it. Great, thanks for clarifying that. And just on the debt repurchases and the debt issuance that you went through with Erika a moment ago, where those consistent with the plan for this year or they - is the plan different than the one that that we talked about last quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">No, it\u2019s consistent with the plan. I mean we may have pulled forward some of the issuance into the second quarter that we otherwise would have planned to do in the third quarter, but we\u2019re still on our plan and we\u2019ll have more to say about debt issuances on Tuesday.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Sure. And the pull forward presumably was because of rate and market opportunity?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yeah, we have the opportunity to do some larger amounts than we otherwise would have given on the heels of certainly the first quarter results that we had and I think you\u2019ve seen kind of continues with the second quarter results, we found a favorable market for debt and we didn\u2019t want to disappoint any investors.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Great, thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">No problem.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question will come from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thank you. Hi John.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Hi.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">John, can you remind us putting off to the side for a moment the possibility of GCB being included in CCAR, can you remind us what the binding constrain on the capital ratio, which ratio were you guys looking at as that binding constrain?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yeah, right now, if the GCB surcharge comes in at the 400 basis points that we would currently estimated to be, it\u2019s sort of running neck and neck between the CET 1 ratio including the GCB surcharge. And what we would look at as far as the CCAR requirements. And that is somewhat dependent upon the scenario that you might get out of CCAR et cetera but it\u2019s pretty much neck and neck CET 1 with GCB and CCAR.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay, thank you. You\u2019ve talked about growing the card business and you\u2019ve had success with acquisitions, now you are putting more muscle into growing that business organically. If you - as you go on the offence from the defensive position you\u2019ve been in the past, are there other areas you guys are looking to grow possibly through acquisitions separate from cards?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I would say that when we think of acquisitions as John spoke earlier would need to be very much in strategy and it would be probably much more bias towards portfolios rather than business acquisitions. So again around our framework fitting in business and having the right accretive attributes where worldwide open to portfolio purchases.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And then my final question, overall credit continues to improve for you folks and the industry but I did notice that nonaccrual area incorporate North America sequentially had a jump in your nonaccruals whereas Latin America had a significant improvement. Could you give us some color on both of those line items?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yeah, the - let\u2019s start with the Latin America line item, that really refluxed an asset sale that we had done, so we actually exited a nonaccrual loan during the quarter so that - you see that reflected in bringing down the nonaccrual loans in Latin America. And then as far as the increase in nonaccrual loans in North America that\u2019s largely driven by some additional classifications of nonaccrual loans coming out of our energy portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And was that as a result of the Shared National Credit Exam, I assume or nowhere something separate?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Well, it\u2019s in connection with the Shared National Credit, we had decided to classify good portion of those loans is nonaccrual. And then what happens, so that let\u2019s leave it like that. But again so from an overall energy exposure point of view, our energy exposure actually declined during the quarter, as far as the exposure that we have to the producer type of client other than that we added to the energy exposure in what we consider to be more the high grade energy processors as far as our multinational clients. So we saw an overall increase in the energy exposure but a decrease in the exposure that we have to the exploration type of clients.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Great, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Not a problem.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Great, thank you. Yeah, most of my questions have been answered, so I have one follow-up questions related to the North America cards and the additional investment spend. I mean we think about it from a receivables point of view I mean where you have additional investment spend, I mean what are the expectations around receivable growth? I guess so differently, is that investment spend needed just to stabilize receivables or you expecting growth above from the arm what you have already because from 1Q to 2Q you saw 8% growth annualize, so you looking to get even further beyond that with those additional investment spend?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I am not quite sure but that 8% number that you referenced that doesn\u2019t quite ring with me, but we would expect then that the incremental market. When you are thinking about cards, it is somewhat of a time sensitive process and so when you spend marketing dollars, the first thing you are doing is you are acquiring accounts then you make those accounts active then those accounts get into spending and then from that spending you end up growing receivables. So marketing dollars spend today are likely to be growing receivables more in the 2017 range than early on in 2016. So it\u2019s not a case of you just add marketing dollars and you certainly sprout receivables.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay, great, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Not a problem.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Your next question comes from the line of David Hilder with Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Hilder</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Thank very much. Just a quick question on the Citi Holdings assets, I think you said that Citi Holdings is at 6% of total assets and it looks like from the footnote, it\u2019s more like 13% of your risk weighted assets, so it looks like the risk weighted assets in Citi Holdings are not coming down as fast as total assets, do you think that kind of relationship will continue and is it related to any particular type of asset to the Holdings?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Well when you take a look at Citi Holdings in particularly, as we got out of the risky assets in Citi Holdings early on we were very focused on making sure that we got out of the most risky assets in Citi Holdings. That relationship between risk weighted assets and GAAP assets in Citi Holdings has been steadily declining. So we\u2019ve got now a $116 billion worth of GAAP assets sitting there in Citi Holdings. The RAP assets, the risk weighted assets associated with Citi Holdings earnings $169 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So you know David, we\u2019ve been de-risking the Holdings portfolio all along and so there isn\u2019t a big multiplier effect anymore associated with that holdings asset. Within that 169 billion, $49 billion of the risk weighted assets are there for operating risk. So it\u2019s really a $120 billion worth of credit and market risk RWA associated with $116 worth of GAAP asset, so it\u2019s virtually a one to one relationship at this point in time between credit and risk - market risk, risk weighted assets and GAAP assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Hilder</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Great. Actually the reference or explanation on operating risk is actually quite helpful. Thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Very, very happy to help you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">John, I was very curious in your comment, most of the banks are getting ask about G-SIB in the inclusion in the CCAR, but now so we had done, there was some talk about counter cyclical buffer side the very beginning of this going into G-SIB. If you look at the counter cyclical buffer average for the money some of banks have 2.5%, the credit loss is in CCAR averaged 2.7%, you look at the G-SIB buffer average for the money center banks kind of looks like now it\u2019s around 3% and if you look at operational loses, it\u2019s actually 3.1%. So your concept of well what through the overall G-SIB buffer in the CCAR then they had have to make some adjustment to operational losses. I think I just was going to ask you to kind of think about that and expand on that concept?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yeah, I wasn\u2019t focused so much Marty on operational loses but there are other aspects of CCAR such as the market risk shock that we all go along with. That market risk shock is really targeted against the major banks. And because the way that market risk shock actually impacts the banks there is a doubling up effect on PPNR reduction and market risk shock. It\u2019s something that it\u2019s known by I guess CCAR [ph] autos and I mean - and again if there was going to be some add on the I can call it the denominator the capital, the I am going to say hope or my thought process would be that we could explore some reduction then in some of the add-ons that go into generating the losses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">But I agree with you, it wouldn\u2019t be operational risk, it\u2019s really just in the way that the CCAR calculations are done and the scenarios are constructed.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Just on saying that that would be coincide then all that these buffers are almost equaling the losses in CCAR and then when you look at the non-money center banks, they have very little operational loss at all and then have any G-SIB buffer. So it\u2019s just the parallel calculation seem to be more than just reveal?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yeah, maybe, I don\u2019t have any inside into how the Fed has come up with some of their models, but I am sure they are quite good at it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Last thing I am going to ask is, and I appreciate the time. As you look at your tangible book value, you\u2019ve without these extra charges because you\u2019ve tied a lot of thing reserved and those what\u2019s are ahead but just assume that less of the head versus what we\u2019ve seen in the past, are your ability to repurchase add or below tangible book value when the returns improving, growth this quarter annualize the tangible book values about 8%, it just seems like that acceleration could continue into the future and just want to see your thoughts on that? Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Well, agree with you that we do think that overtime we have the ability to grow tangible book, obviously as I mentioned before one of the items that you are always focused on with tangible book is the impact of rates on your AFS portfolio and you\u2019ve seen that there were times when that can have a - that can play a heavy hand in dampening down the growth, but we do believe that if we can continue to perform we should the way we have been, we have the opportunity to continue to grow tangible book. It\u2019s one of the reasons why we think that continuing with stock repurchases is the right thing to do from a capital return point of view.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Thanks again.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Not a problem.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Your next question will come from the line of Christopher Wheeler with Atlantic Equities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christopher Wheeler</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yes, good morning, gentlemen. David Hilder set my question out really well, he is colleague of mine. I actually do with the rundown of Citi Holdings that how that impacts this weighted assets because you mentioned the 34 billion which you basically got baked in and you just touched on the relationship between the GAAP assets and the RWA. So if we were to be looking at what is going to happen to the 12.79 billion of RWA you had fully faced at the end of the second quarter, I mean obviously I would imagine that a minimum would be 34 billion coming of that pro forma. And I supposed to question I am asking is how much more might come off in respect of the uplift between the GAAP assets and RWA? And also perhaps how much you think you might use in actually growing the business during that period? Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Thank you, Christopher. Let me pass through some of those questions. First, just to be clear the assets that we\u2019ve got under contract is 32 billion, I think I heard you say 34.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christopher Wheeler</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I must - I think that\u2019s just me, I went too many bank results obviously in few days.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Sorry, I don\u2019t mean to add to your numbers, but I just wanted to make sure that you\u2019ve focused on the 32. As much as I said that overall there is a virtually a one to one relationship between credit and market risk RWA and GAAP RWA that obviously is not the same with each asset that we have and included in that $32 billion worth of assets that I mentioned of course is the sale of our Japan retail bank. On our Japan retail bank would be one of those situations where the RWA associated where actually be much less than the GAAP assets. So I can\u2019t guide you to how much RWA is associated with the overall 32 but I wouldn\u2019t immediately jump to the conclusion that the 32 is one for one reduction in RWA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And John the piece I would add to that is from an expectation perspective, John mentioned the $49 billion of assets associated with operations, as assets come down you can\u2019t simply release the ops RWA, it\u2019s going to take time to work through that, so you should expect to see as a percentage of Holdings RWA as we reduce assets that ops piece continuing to growth both as a percentage. Yeah.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christopher Wheeler</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Both as a percentage. Okay, thank you very much, that\u2019s very helpful, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Not a problem.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And at this time, there are no further questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Susan Kendall</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Great, thank you all for joining us. If you have any follow-up questions please feel free to follow-up with Investor Relations.

Today's call be hosted by Peter Kapp, Head of Fixed Income Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions]. Mr. Kapp, you may begin.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Peter Kapp</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you, Brent. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CFO, John Gerspach, will take you through the fixed income investor presentation which is available for download on our website, Citigroup.com. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements which are based on Management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Actual results and capital and other financial condition, may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2014 Form 10-K.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">With that said, let me turn it over to John.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you, Peter and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to be hosting our fixed income investor review this quarter. I'd like to begin by highlighting some key points from our second quarter 2015 results, on slide 2.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Last week, we reported a strong quarter, earning $4.7 billion while making continued progress on our execution priorities. We saw balanced performance across our institutional and consumer segments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We grew revenues and achieved positive operating leverage in Citicorp. And Citi Holdings was again profitable during the quarter. Holdings assets are down 22% over the past year, to $116 billion and we have signed agreements to sell an additional $32 billion of these assets, virtually all of which we expect to close by year end. For the first half of the year, Citigroup's efficiency ratio was 56%, our ROA was 103 basis points and we generated a return on tangible common equity of 10.5%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We utilized $1.5 billion of deferred tax assets through the first half of 2015, contributing to continued strong capital generation. We have continued to maintain an efficient balance sheet, growing loans and deposits in Citicorp and generating a net interest margin of 295 basis points for the quarter. Credit quality remains strong across our consumer and corporate loan portfolios.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We maintained a strong funding profile, as our deposit quality continues to improve and we executed against our debt issuance plans. And our capital, leverage and liquidity ratios remained strong, as we generated $3.5 billion of CET1 capital during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">On slide 3, we show total Citigroup results, adjusted for the items noted on the slide. As I noted earlier, during the quarter, we earned $4.7 billion. Net income grew by over $700 million year over year, driven by core improvement in Citicorp.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Revenues declined on a reported basis, to $19.2 billion, but increased 3% year over year in constant dollars, driven by 5% growth in Citicorp. Expenses declined 7% year over year and 1% in constant dollars, mostly reflecting the lower legal and repositioning charges. Our second-quarter results provide a solid start to 2015, better demonstrating our underlying earnings power and the impact of the actions we've taken to simplify and streamline our operations.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Turning to slide 4, we show trends in our balance sheet. Our discipline in maintaining total assets at approximately $1.8 trillion over the past year and our efforts to improve the efficiency of our balance sheet, help us prepare for regulatory requirements and achieve our return targets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">On a reported basis, our total assets declined by over $80 billion in the past year, largely as a result of the dollar's appreciation against foreign currencies, especially the euro, Mexican peso and yen. To provide more meaningful insights into our underlying business trends, we presented this slide and several others in today's presentation, on a constant dollar basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">On this basis, net loans and deposits in Citicorp grew 4% and 3%, respectively, year over year across our businesses, offset by the continued wind-down of Citi Holdings. We have maintained a liquid balance sheet, with 27% of our assets in cash and investments and approximately half of our balance sheet funded by deposits.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We were able to further reduce short-term borrowings by $13 billion in the quarter and $32 billion from last year, as a result of growth in high quality deposits, as we managed our liquidity profile.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Slide 5 shows the trends in our loan portfolio. In constant dollars, total Citigroup loans decreased 1% year over year, as 4% growth in Citicorp was offset by continued significant reductions in Citi Holdings. Consumer loans grew 1% year over year, with broad-based growth driving a 3% increase in international consumer loans. Corporate loans grew 6% year over year. Our corporate lending portfolio increased 10%, with growth in North America and EMEA, as we continued to support our target clients.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Private bank volumes increased, particularly in North America and TTS loans declined 11%, as we have maintained our return profile by reducing our balances of trade finance receivables in response to spread compression in certain markets, especially China. Citi Holdings loans decreased 33% year over year, driven by a $16 billion reduction in North America mortgages, as well as the impact of our previously announced agreements to sell OneMain and the Japan credit card business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">On slide 6, we show continued stability in our consumer and corporate credit trends. In the second quarter, consumer credit remained favorable, with a net credit loss rate of 224 basis points. In North America and Asia, trends remained broadly stable. And in Latin America, the NCO rate decreased somewhat from last quarter, consistent with delinquency trends.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Our corporate portfolio also continues to see favorable credit performance. Nonaccrual loans remained stable, at 38 basis points of corporate loans. Latin America declined, as we sold the nonaccrual loans. And North America increased, primarily driven by downgrades in our energy portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We built reserves against our energy exposures by approximately $43 million in the quarter, mainly related to our North America E&amp;P exposures. We again realized virtually no NCL's against the energy sector during the quarter. While we are building reserves, we continue to believe that the risk is well contained and we expect any losses we incur to be manageable.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Turning to slide 7, we show our deposit composition. Citicorp deposits grew 3% in constant dollars, with continued high quality deposits flows across our franchise. Consumer deposits increased 3%, with 4% growth in international markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Corporate deposits increased 8% year over year, with a continued focus on growing high quality deposits and limiting lower quality deposits, such as non-operating deposits of financial institutions. Citi Holdings and other deposits declined significantly year over year, driven by the impact of our agreement to sell the Japan retail business which resulted in the reclassification of $21 billion of deposits to held for sale last year, as well as the continued transfer of MSSB deposits to Morgan Stanley which has now been completed.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Slide 8 demonstrates the diversity and stability of our deposit franchise. Over 55% of our deposits are outside the U.S., providing local funding for our overseas operations. We run these operations with balance sheets that are largely matched by currency and liquidity characteristics. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Overall, Citigroup's deposits have a 74% liquidity value under the LCR, up 100 basis points from last quarter. We expect deposit quality to remain relatively stable at this level, based on our current business mix. Each 100 basis point improvement in liquidity value reduces our HQLA requirement by approximately $9 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In our consumer business, our deposits have an 87% LCR liquidity value. Our efforts to deepen our relationships with retail customers, including increasing the penetration of direct deposit and bill pay, as well as other products like mortgages and credit card, have also served to increase the stickiness of our deposits.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">And in the corporate business, we have increased the liquidity value of deposits to approximately 68%. We have reduced non-operating deposits with 100% runoff to $56 billion currently, down by about one-third over the past year. And we continue to work with clients to grow operating accounts, while reducing lower LCR liquidity value deposits.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On slide 9, we update our regulatory liquidity metrics. Our LCR, under the U.S. rules, is 111%, in excess of the 100% minimum requirement and consistent with the levels we have maintained over the past year. Over time, we would expect to manage our LCR in the range of 105% to 110%, based on current regulatory requirements.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">As of June 30, our HQLA was $386 billion, down $15 billion from the prior quarter. Our estimated net outflows under the LCR declined by $14 billion during the quarter, reflecting the improvement in the LCR liquidity value of our deposits, as well as the continued reduction of our short-term borrowings. Continued discipline around our funding structure will allow us to maintain an efficient level of liquidity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On the right side, you can see the composition of our HQLA as of the end of the quarter, over 80% of which is in cash and sovereign debt. We continue to expect the U.S. regulators to propose a U.S. version of the net stable funding ratio sometime during 2015. We believe that our NSFR is in excess of 100% under the international version of the NSFR rule.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On slide 10, we show Citigroup's net interest revenue and margin. Our net interest margin increased sequentially, to 295 basis points, driven by a higher-than-expected contribution from trading NIM which can fluctuate quarter to quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Excluding this impact, our net interest margin would have been closer to 291 basis points and we expect to maintain roughly this level for the third quarter. Looking to the fourth quarter, our results will depend in part on the timing of a number of upcoming actions, including the completion of our OneMain and Japan retail business sales and our planned debt buybacks. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">And as you can see on slide 29 in the appendix, we continue to expect a NIM benefit from a rising rate environment, consistent with recent quarters. Our estimate of the net interest revenue benefit and a 100 basis point instantaneous rate shock scenario, increased modestly to $2 billion, of which $1.4 billion reflects the impact of U.S. rates. In managing our interest rate risk, we routinely consider the impact of many scenarios, including a range of market and macro-economic conditions, as well as the expected behavior of our clients.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On slide 11, we show the composition of our long-term debt outstanding. During the quarter, our long-term debt increased slightly, to $212 billion. Bank-issued debt declined $2 billion, as we reduced our reliance on credit cards securitizations, in anticipation of the potential impact of TLAC. Parent company debt increased by $3 billion during the quarter, to $155 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We currently expect to end the year with total Parent company long-term debt of roughly $160 billion. Our weighted average maturity fell to 6.7 years, due in part to the repurchase of some longer-dated securities during the quarter. Over time, we intend to maintain our WAM at around seven years. And our total preferred stock stands at $14 billion, providing nearly 110 basis points of additional Tier 1 capital.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On slide 12, we update our issuance and redemption expectations for long-term debt in 2015. For the full year 2015, we expect to issue approximately $25 billion of benchmark debt. We issued nearly $16 billion of senior and subordinated debt during the first half of the year, including offerings in dollars, euros and Canadian dollars.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">For the remainder of the year, we expect to issue approximately $10 billion of benchmark debt. Year to date, in addition to $10 billion of maturities, we have reduced long-term debt by an additional $11 billion, including $6 billion of buybacks. For the balance of the year, we expect additional repurchases of $4 billion to $5 billion of benchmark debt.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As previously indicated, we expect to buy back some of our higher-cost debt in connection with the completion of our sell of OneMain. Consistent with our prior debt buybacks, these will be NPV positive and will help us lower our cost of funds.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In the first half of 2015, we issued $3.5 billion of preferred stock. We will remain opportunistic around market conditions and currently expect to issue an additional $2 billion or so of preferred in the second half of 2015, as we continue to build towards 150 basis points of additional Tier 1 capital. On slide 13, we update our estimates of our total loss absorbing capacity, based on the FSB's November 2014 consultative document and our ongoing discussions with regulators and other industry participants.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We have yet to see any formal proposals or feedback from our regulators, although we continue to expect something this year. Accordingly, consistent with our prior estimates, we include CET1 capital, preferred stock and unsecured parent-issued senior and subordinated debt with at least one year remaining until maturity, as well as a small portion of our customer-related debt, in our estimates of TLAC.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We estimate Citigroup's total loss-absorbing capacity increased to $273 billion or 21.3% of our risk-weighted assets and 11.4% of our total leverage exposure. We calibrate this 21.3% against potential requirements of 22% to 26%, depending upon the base TLAC requirement of 16% to 20% and at 3.5% GSIB surcharge.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">I'll discuss the Fed's final GSIB rules more in a minute. This range translates to $282 billion to $333 billion of required TLAC or $9 billion to $60 billion more than our current TLAC estimate.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We have identified a number of sources with which to meet this incremental TLAC need, as necessary. As we have previously communicated, we already expect to issue $4 billion to $6 billion of preferred stock, as well as net issuance of $6 billion to $8 billion of subordinated debt, to meet our other existing regulatory capital requirements.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">And then, to the extent additional TLAC is required, we estimate approximately $10 billion of existing principal-protected notes, within our customer related debt, may become eligible under the final rules. And an addition $10 billion of customer-related debt could possibly be included, with some structural changes to our issuance program. These sources alone total nearly $35 billion of potential TLAC-eligible funding.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Beyond that, if necessary we would look to issue incremental senior debt to replace non-TLAC eligible funding, including non-eligible customer-related debt, securitizations and repo financing. So we have multiple ways of addressing our potential TLAC requirements based on proposals to date, but we continue to await formal regulatory guidance or rules.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to slide 14, let me summarize our capital position which remains among the strongest in the industry. During the quarter, our fully phased in CET1 capital ratio increased approximately 30 basis points, to 11.4%, driven by our retained earnings and DTA utilization and after returning $1.7 billion to shareholders, through share repurchases and common stock dividends.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Risk-weighted assets under advanced approaches also decreased $5 billion, to $1.279 billion. Under transition agreements, our CET1 capital ratio increased by 50 basis points, to 13.8%. Our supplementary leverage ratio grew to 6.7%, driven by the strong capital generation and $2 billion of preferred stock issuance, as well as a decline in our leveraged exposure. Citibank's SLR also increased 10 basis points in the quarter, to 6.7%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On slide 15, let me address the final U.S. GSIB surcharge rule released yesterday. Our review of the rule is ongoing. With that said, I'd like to make several observations about our current understanding. While in many ways the final rule is consistent with the December proposal, it does include several important changes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">First, the final rule determines the GSIB surcharge based on fixed aggregate measures of systemic importance, rather than the relative measures used in the proposed rule. Second, it replaces a spot FX rate with a three-year average of daily exchange rates. And third, it better recognizes the regulatory treatment of certain types of short-term wholesale funding.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Most notably, it reduces the penalty for holding non-operational deposits which have been addressed separately through the LCR. Under the original proposal, we estimated that we would be subject to a 4% GSIB surcharge. We now expect a 3.5% surcharge, based on our current interpretation of the final rule, consistent with the Fed's estimate.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">While this final rule did not go as far as we would have liked, especially with respect to the treatment of deposits, it is clearly a move in the right direction. As described, this rule affirmatively allows the industry to better measure the impact of specific actions on each firm's GSIB surcharge, consistent with the Fed's policy objectives.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Moving to our last slide, let me summarize four major points. First, we reported solid results in the second quarter, with revenue growth and positive operating leverage in Citicorp, lower legal and repositioning expenses and continued favorable credit trends. And we utilized $1.5 billion of DTAs in the first half.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Second, we have actively managed our balance sheet, maintaining total assets around $1.8 trillion and optimizing our assets and liabilities to support client needs and improve returns. Credit trends remain favorable across both our consumer and corporate portfolios and we have maintained a stable net interest margin.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Third, our deposit base remains a key strength, as we continue to improve the liquidity value of our deposits. Our 2015 issuance plans are on track, including preparations for formal guidance related to TLAC. And lastly, we have continued to prepare our business and balance sheet for the ongoing evolution of the regulatory environment. Our capital and liquidity remains strong.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">This concludes our fixed income review. I'll now be happy to take your questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p5\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Ryan O'Connell with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ryan O'Connell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">I would like to talk about two areas and one is just to clarify some things about Holdings. You've mentioned that there are $32 billion of sales in the pipeline. I guess I'd like to know how much of that is actually reflected in the numbers already? Or let's put it another way. Once those sales are completed which I think you've indicated might be by year end, what would be, ballpark, the level of assets in Holdings?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">It's kind of simple. If you just did those $32 billion, the 112 billion [ph] and of all $32 billion -- if $116 billion, the $116 billion of all $32 billion closed would drop down to 84%. Now of course, we'd also have other activities during the third and the fourth quarter, but all $32 billion that I mentioned are contained in the $116 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ryan O'Connell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">And then on the earnings call, I think what you said is that the target was to operate Holdings at breakeven. I wasn't sure if it was in to next year or through next year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Our goal is to operate Holdings at a breakeven through next year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ryan O'Connell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Secondary is on North American cards. Just if we could talk about some of the trends there? If I look at the branded cards, purchase sales are up 5%, so that is good. But if we look at the revenues, accounts, loans, they're all down about, let's say, 4% or 5%. And at least one of your competitors, JP, cards are up about 1%, sales are up about 7%. So I know you said on the call that branded cards is an area for investment. But I wondered if you could share a little bit more color on how you plan to restore growth in that business?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">That's exactly where the investments would be targeted, Ryan. I think that one of the things that we did coming out of the crisis -- certainly during the crisis, we had slowed down investments, as you can imagine, in virtually all of our products. Coming out of the crisis, we did ramp up marketing spend in branded cards, if you go back to 2010, 2011, but we really got substandard results from that marketing spend, simply because it was really our product array that needed work.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So we've been -- Jud Linville and his team have been hard at work, over the last couple of years, to really improve our product offerings. And I think they've done a great job, standardizing the product offering on a couple of common platforms and now that we've got the product array in place, what we believe is our next thing is, we need to get, once again then, begin to lift the level of marketing spend that we have in our cards business. So that is something that you will be seeing during the second half of this year and then clearly into 2016.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Your next question comes from the line of Robert Smalley with UBS. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Robert Smalley</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">I had a couple of questions, one on metals and mining exposure and then just a couple of questions on issuance around TLAC. First, on the metals and mining, could you talk about your exposure to coal, iron ore and copper? Specifically, I'm interested in if you can provide any numbers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">But also, I know that there has been a lot of reports about regulators clamping down or criticizing more assets in oil and gas. I'm wondering if the same thing has happened in coal? And what your experience has been with the portfolio there, as we're starting to see some of these companies file or try and restructure their outstanding debt?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Yes, Robert, I'm sorry. I'm not prepared to talk about anything to do with metals and mining exposure on this call, simply because, quite frankly, as we were preparing for subjects that we thought might be of interest, we didn't see anything in our portfolio that looked like it was going to draw questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Robert Smalley</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So if we could shift over to a couple of the questions around slides 12 and 13. John, you had mentioned and I'm talking about slide 13 here. On potential TLAC requirements, two things you had mentioned potentially, $10 billion in principal protected notes that might be included and then $10 billion with some structural changes. I believe last time, you had alluded to the -- making some modifications in structured notes. But has there been any change? Or why did you identify the principal protected notes as well? Have you gotten any guidance along those lines?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">I think we're just using maybe slightly different words to describe what was essentially the same as last year. The only thing I think we've noted is that we do think, now, there has probably two groups of $10 billion, as opposed to one group of $10 billion. We are getting some feedback that there could be some change in the definitions of the customer-related debt that would be included.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And therefore, it is possible that roughly $10 billion of those principal protected notes might then, therefore, become TLAC eligible. And then, there's also the other $10 billion that we think we could get to TLAC eligibility with some structural change. But all of that is going to be dependent on exactly how the final rule comes out and the specifics that would be contained therein.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Robert Smalley</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And then finally, on page 12, you had mentioned about $10 billion left to do in benchmark issuance this year. So far, I think you've done about $11.5 billion senior, $4 billion subordinated. Will that upcoming $10 billion be in the same proportion, senior to sub? Or have you fulfilled the sub requirement for 2015?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">I'm not going to address the mix that we might do towards the end of the year. But again, we are focused on doing $10 billion of the benchmark debt. But I really can't give you specific guidance as to what percentage might be or might not be, in either of those categories.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Your next question comes from the line of David Knutson with Legal &amp; General. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Knutson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">A couple of questions have been answered, but I wanted to ask a broader question about your emerging market exposures. The outlook, I think you talked about Asia being optimistic or optimistic on Asia, but Latin America seems to be struggling. It's a core part of the business. How does -- how patient will the bank be with some of the franchises throughout the region, as it goes through, maybe, a cyclical or structural decline?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Yes, David, interesting question. But the good thing is, what we have is really and what we've built, is truly a client-focused business. We're in these regions to support our clients. And when we take a look at whether it's some of the [indiscernible] countries that are either in Latin America or Asia or anywhere in the world, for the most part, the business that we do in those countries -- certainly on the corporate side, our institutional business -- is really focused, for the most part, on the subs of multinational clients that we bank around the world. So we feel very good about the credit quality of those relationships.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">We're not in those countries competing with the local banks for local businesses. We're either serving, as I said, the subs of those multinational clients or in certain instances, we'll be serving very large local multi-nationals. But we tend to focus our business on that specific client segment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And then to the extent we're in those countries with our consumer business, for the most part, our consumer business is really focused on what I'll call the mass affluent customer base. And again, that's largely an urban-based customer segment. And I think you've seen the results of how our credit performance has held up, over time, in the consumer business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And clearly in Asia, even with everything that had gone on in Korea and to a certain extent still goes on within Korea -- our NCL rate in Asia has hovered somewhere between 80 and 96 or 95 basis points. So we think that we're focused on, certainly, the right customer segment for us and it's something that we are very vigilant about.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Knutson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Your comment regarding no increase of NCLs from energy sector exposures, I appreciate. I imagine they flow in over time. Do you have an expectation of when, broadly speaking, analysts or we should start to expect to see energy companies crack? I guess people made a lot of noise when the oil price first dropped, but I imagine it takes time for companies to recognize the risk.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">David, if you think, on a public call, I'm going to tell you the time when -- energy companies are going to crack, come on.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Knutson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">All right, so maybe, from a different perspective I'm expecting the losses to come in over time. There shouldn't be any particular quarter. Or is there something about your energy exposures which would lump a loss recognition?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I don't think that you should be looking at any lumpy loss recognition. We've built the reserves. We'd like to think that we could manage through this without taking any significant NCLs. During the quarter, as I think I mentioned on last week's call, we did increase our overall exposure to energy and energy-related businesses, by $1 billion, $1.5 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">But importantly, we reduced our exposure to what might be considered to be the riskiest element of that business which would be the E&amp;P segment, that actually came down. So the E&amp;P segment now represents, I think, something like 27% of our energy portfolio. That's down from North of 30%, where it would have been last quarter. So again, this is all part of active management of the portfolio, as you would expect us to do.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Knutson</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And the last question, it's regarding TLAC, what you laid out. And when you think about the expected timetable to comply with it, it doesn't look to be that punitive, unless all the big banks will rush to comply, like they have with some of the other rules that have come out. In my mind, this is something that doesn't prohibit capital distributions or some other thing that would encourage management teams to rush to implement it quickly. Is that the right way to think about a TLAC requirement? That the full implementation time period will be used, instead of everyone rushing over the next two, three quarters to finish it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">That would certainly be my view of it. I can't speak for others, but that's clearly my view.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question comes from the line of David Jiang with Prudential. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Jiang</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">A question about your fully implemented Basel III RWAs. How much of that is operational risk RWAs? And if you could break it down between what's in Holdings and at the core?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yes. The overall op-risk RWA that is in the $1.279 trillion -- I think I may have said billion during the call, but I should have said $1.279 trillion. There is $325 billion of op-risk RWA in the $1.279 trillion. Within the $1.279 trillion, we've got $169 billion of risk-weighted assets associated with Holdings. And then within that $169 billion, $49 billion of that is op-risk.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Jiang</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So $49 billion of the $325 billion is in Holdings?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yes, exactly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Jiang</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">How do you think about how that rolls off? Is there a way to think about, as time passes on, that the models will incorporate less of that? Or is parts of it going to go away quicker, like Citi Holdings versus Citicorp?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">No, I would say that, in both cases, you're looking at multiple years before you're going to see a meaningful reduction in that amount, even as we continue to sell businesses in Holdings. Just the way of the op-risk models work and certainly, the supervisory guidance that we get indicate that it is the passage of time that ultimately, passage of time and the non-occurrence of similar events, that ultimately then will allow you to begin to take down that exposure.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">That's why, as we think in terms of that $169 billion of risk-weighted assets associated with Holdings, the $120 billion of that's associated with either credit or market risk, that, as we sell the assets, we'll get out of immediately, but that last $49 billion is something that is going to trail out over a number of years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Jiang</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Second question I had was, there has been some press reports about potentially selling Banamex U.S.A. And I was wondering would that change any of the strategy for the Banamex Mexico, the core unit?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">One, I'm not going to make any comment on anything that could be in the papers. And certainly, we don't comment on any sales activities or purchase activities, on these types of calls, until we're ready to announce something, but Banamex U.S.A and Banamex are two separate entities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rogers with Conning &amp; Company. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Rogers</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Just a question for you on your Standard &amp; Poor's rating. I'm just wondering, they remain out there with a negative outlook on the Holding company, as they've been for some time, seemingly awaiting clarity on the TLAC rules. Do you get any sense from them that the solid performance that you folks have certainly put on the board in recent quarters could be increasingly sufficient enough of an offset to save the A-minus Holding company rating?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">That's obviously something that they'll have to determine on their own. I can't speak for them. I know that they are aware of our performance and I'm sure they'll take everything into consideration.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question comes from the line of Louise Pitt with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Louise Pitt</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Most of my questions have been answered, but I just have a quick question with respect to the redemptions. So that number changed slightly in the slides this quarter, I think. Could you just walk us through what, if any, are your primary drivers about how you're looking at redemptions at this point? Is it currency, is it maturities, is it coupon? Is it all of the above?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">It's really all of that. Some of what we do is, we look at individual debt issues that could be trading at wider spreads than what our current secondary trading levels would be. So that provides an opportunity. And it's something that we look at on an issue by issue basis is about all I can tell you, Louise. We look for those inefficiencies and try to address them.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Louise Pitt</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Just a follow-up question, similarly related, but can you just clarify what approvals are needed and what the process for that is, with respect to redemption of capital securities? So either Tier 1 qualifying or Tier 2 qualifying securities? Do you have to formally request that from the Fed? Or is it just a phone call that you make ahead of taking those out?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">No, those are all included in the capital plan that we would submit to the Fed. So that would all be part of our CCAR submission.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Louise Pitt</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So that's more of a long-term planning, rather than a pure market trading level on those securities, in terms of redemption?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">It's something we certainly need to contemplate in advance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question comes from the line of Arnold Kakuda with Bloomberg Intelligence. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Arnold Kakuda</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Quick question on, you talked about the portfolio's sensitivity to interest rates and I think you mentioned that you slightly increased the sensitivity to rates this quarter? And I just wanted to contrast that with -- I think a peer talked about increase in the duration on its balance sheet. And they swapped floating-rate instruments for fixed. So I just want to see what you guys did with the balance sheet versus a peer's comments?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">The increase that we had, as I said, was fairly slight. I think it went from $1.9 billion to $2 billion. So it doesn't really reflect a significant shift, nor does it reflect any sort of significant change in our overall balance sheet management approach.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Arnold Kakuda</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And then on the GSIB surcharge, clearly, a 3.5% surcharge, better than the 4% that you expected, but how sticky is that 3.5%? Are there certain things that you can do to mitigate it down to maybe potentially a 3% bucket? And I guess, with some of the wind-downs in Citi Holdings for the rest of this year, would that incrementally potentially move you from a 3.5% bucket down to a lower one?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Even within these buckets, don't forget there are ranges. And so when you look at the buckets, the range, at least in the buckets that we'd be looking at, basically, it's about 100 points that are in there. So the Fed, I think, published that we had a score of 714. Our own calculations came out with 715. So we're pretty close to where the Fed was.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">In order to move down to the 3% bucket, we'd have to get under 630. So that would be an 85 basis point move which is not to say that it's impossible to do, but it is not necessarily something that you're going to be able to do in a short timeframe.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And we've had the final rule now for something less than 24 hours. So it's a little early for us to comment as to the feasibility or the desirability of putting together an active program to move down. The one thing you can say, that we have been saying, is we will do everything to continue to make this institution safer and stronger.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And simpler and smaller seem to be the order of the day and it's something we've been actively looking to do. So we will continue to do everything we can to drive those four things to be simpler, smaller, safer and stronger and still be able to serve our clients. And if we can do that by being in a 3% bucket, then that is exactly what we will do.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Arnold Kakuda</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And then lastly, another question on ratings, but more from the Moody's side, you benefited from a notch upgrade on the methodology. But just in light of the stronger earnings that you guys have had in the past few quarters, 9% return on equity for the first half of the year, yet you're still ranked at Baa 1 on the Senior Hold Co, a notch below others at A3. So just want to see if you guys are having updated conversations with Moody's? And getting their thoughts on your fundamental improvements there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes, no, we have conversations with each of the rating agencies on a very regular basis. So they are fully aware of the progress that we have made and we're very hopeful that, at the appropriate time, each one of them will recognize the progress that we think is evident in not just our net income performance, but in the construct and the management of our balance sheet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rogers with Conning &amp; Company. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Rogers</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes, John, just to follow up. These have been awful good times in lending, for quite a period of time now. And I just wanted to get your bigger picture view, as to where you may see excesses developing in lending that Citi has or will make a conscious effort to pull back from?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Again, we try to look very closely at every one of the activities that we're involved in. I think you'll note that we have been steadily moving down the league tables, when it comes to leverage finance. And so that might give you some indication of one of the areas, at least, that we would look at with somewhat less enthusiasm than others.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question comes from the line of Scott Cavanagh with APG. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Scott Cavanagh</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">It's clearly a star performer in the industry, on this perspective. So I just had a question on upcoming regulatory rulings or potential rulings. When we think about the single credit counterparty limit, how does this impact you? And what are you guys expecting?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I'm sorry, Scott, that's one area that -- I just don't have anything prepared on that one. I haven't looked at that in the last couple of days and I'm sorry. I just can't.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Thank you, that concludes the question-and-answer session. Mr. Kapp, do you have any closing remarks?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Peter Kapp</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. If you have follow-up questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to us in Investor Relations. We'll talk to you again next quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Thank you. This concludes today's conference call.

Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Mike Corbat will speak first. Then John Gerspach, our CFO will take you through the earnings presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we will be happy to take questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results and capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today, and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the risk factor section of our 2014 Form 10-K. With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Michael L. Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you Susan and good morning everyone. Earlier today we reported earnings of $4.2 billion for the third quarter of 2015 or $1.31 per share excluding the impact of CVA and DVA. The quarter had more than its fair share of volatility and our results speak to the resilience of our franchise globally. And despite the revenue headwinds we once again proved our ability to manage our expenses and will remain on track to deliver our full year efficiency and return on asset targets. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">I feel good about the quality and consistency of the earnings that we have demonstrated through the course of the year. We have also made strong progress against our other core priorities. We achieved both positive operating leverage and continued loan and deposit growth in our core businesses. We continued to improve the quality of our balance sheet by replacing legacy assets from Citi Holdings with high solid loans in Citicorp. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Citi Holdings was profitable again this quarter, Holdings assets declined 20% on a year-over-year end basis and we will end at 110 billion for the quarter which represents only 6% of Citigroup's balance sheet. We expect to close an additional 31 billion of asset sales during the fourth quarter. We utilized an additional 700 million in deferred tax assets this quarter bringing the total utilization to $2.1 billion through the third quarter which has contributed $3.5 billion to our regulatory capital. In total we generated $14 billion of regulatory capital so far this year and have been able to return over 4 billion of that capital to our shareholders in the form of share buybacks and common dividends. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We grew our tangible book value to over $60 per share and our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio increased to 11.6% on a fully implemented basis. With one quarter to go we are on track to hit our financial targets in return of assets and our efficiency ratio and we also earned a 10% return on tangible common equity so far this year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Turning to the results of our businesses, while the uncertain environment clearly dampened client activity in our market products, we made good progress in other areas. With revenue growth in treasury and trade solutions, security services, and the private bank equities also grew. And while our total fixed income revenues were under pressure we saw continued strength in our emerging market franchise. We also continued to see momentum in M&amp;A year-to-date as a result of investments we\u2019ve made in that business. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Internationally our consumer banking business was also impacted by slowing growth and shifting consumer sentiment most notably in Asia. In the U.S. our retail franchise continued to grow revenues, loans, and deposits even as we continued to sharpen the focus of our branch footprint. And in branded cards we are seeing growth in active accounts and purchase sales although it\u2019s going to take some time for the full benefit of our investments in this business to be reflected in our results. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">As we look to the end of the year, we still don\u2019t have clarity on many important issues. Predictions on the timing of an interest rate increase seem to change every day. We don\u2019t yet know the long-term impact of recent volatility on consumer and business sentiment. And in many large markets, there are high degrees of political risk which have economic ramifications. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">I think that this quarter showed that we are well equipped to handle what the world throws our way whether it\u2019s managing our risk, our expenses, or our capital. Challenging environments have become the norm and the work we\u2019ve done to make our firm simpler, smaller, safer, and stronger has given us a resilient and sturdy platform from which to operate. John will now go through the deck and then we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. John. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><strong>John C. Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Hey, thank you Mike and good morning everyone. Starting on slide 3, we highlight the impact of CVA, DVA, on our reported results. Excluding this item we earned $1.31 per share in the recent quarter compared to $0.95 in the third quarter of 2014. On slide 4, we show a total city group results. In the third quarter we earned $4.2 billion generating a return on assets of 91 basis points and a return on tangible common equity of 8.9%. Revenues of 18.5 billion were down 8% from last year mostly reflecting an impact of foreign exchange translation. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In constant dollars revenues declined 2% year-over-year as the slight improvement in Citicorp was more than offset by lower revenues in Citi Holdings. Expenses declined 18% year-over-year driven by lower legal and repositioning charges, as well as the benefit from FX translation. And net credit losses continued to improve offset by a significantly lower net loan loss reserve release. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Turning to the first nine months of 2015, the total efficiency ratio for Citigroup including Citi Holdings was 56.5%. Net income grew about 22% year-over-year. We generated an ROA of 99 basis points and our return on tangible common equity was 10%. In constant dollars, Citigroup end of period loans declined to 1% year-over-year to 622 billion as 5% growth in Citicorp was more than offset by the continued line down of Citi Holdings. And deposits were flat versus last year at 904 billion also reflecting 4% growth in Citicorp offset by a decline in Citi Holdings. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">On slide 5, we provide more detail on third quarter revenues in constant dollars. Citicorp revenues were up slightly year-over-year and Citi Holdings revenues declined by nearly 30% mostly reflecting higher gains on asset sales in the prior year including the impact of selling our consumer operations in Spain and Greece. On slide 6, we show more detail on expenses in constant dollars. Citicorp expenses were down 13% year-over-year driven by significantly lower legal and repositioning cost. And Citi Holdings expenses also declined on lower assets. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On slide 7, we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Year-to-date Citicorp has contributed over 97% of our net income while Citi Holdings although profitable has had a limited impact on total earnings. As I just described we generated positive operating leverage again this quarter in Citicorp with revenues up slightly and expenses down 13% in constant dollars. And for the first nine months of 2015 we achieved a Citicorp efficiency ratio of 55.4%. Citi Holdings remained profitable this quarter and ended the period with $110 billion of assets. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On slide 8, we show results for international consumer banking in constant dollars. In total international consumer banking revenues grew 2% year-over-year. In Latin America, excluding the gain of approximately $180 million this quarter on the sale of our merchant acquiring business in Mexico, revenues were roughly flat versus last year as a modest increase in loan and deposit balances was offset by continued spread compression. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Card loan balances in Mexico remained under pressure this quarter reflecting both slower economic growth and ongoing shifts in consumer behavior. However, we were able to offset this impact with growth in personal loans and other retail banking products. Overall, we are maintaining a strong share of consumer loans and deposits in Mexico and importantly credit continues to perform well which I will discuss more in a moment. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to Asia, consumer revenues declined 6% year-over-year driven by lower investment sales revenues as well as continued high payment rates and ongoing regulatory pressure in cards. We saw an industry wide slow down in activity in Asia during the quarter reflecting changes in consumer sentiment driven by slowing economic growth and the recent volatility in the capital markets. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In retail banking we continued to see year-over-year revenue growth in lending, insurance, and deposit products. However, this was more than offset by lower investment sales revenue. And in cards we saw a slower than expected growth in purchase sales this quarter. Card loans still grew modestly year-over-year but this growth was muted by the impact of continued high payment rates. And regulatory changes remained a headwind as well although we continued to believe this will abate somewhat as we go forward. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In total, average international loans grew 3% from last year, card purchase sales grew 5%, and average deposits grew 4%. Operating expenses grew 1% as higher regulatory and compliance cost and technology investments were mostly offset by lower legal and repositioning cost as well as ongoing efficiency savings. And credit cost increased 7% from last year driven by our loan loss reserve build in Latin America. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Our NCL and delinquency rates continued to improve this quarter in Latin America. However, given the macroeconomic environment we did build another loan loss reserves in particular in Brazil. We have taken a cautious approach in Brazil for several years now including the sale of our mass market credit card business, Credicard in late 2013. At less than $3 billion, the Brazil consumer portfolio now represents just 1% of our global consumer loans and we do not expect it to have a material impact on our total consumer cost of credit as we look forward. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Slide 9 shows the results for North America consumer banking. Total revenues declined 4% year-over-year and were flat sequentially. Retail banking revenues of 1.3 billion grew 3% from last year as continued loan and deposit growth and improved deposit spreads were partially offset by the impact of $15 million mortgage repurchase reserve release in the prior year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In branded cards revenues of $1.9 billion were down 9% from last year driven by a modest decline in average loans and an increase in acquisition and rewards cost as we have continued to ramp up new account acquisitions in our core products. We feel confident that we now have the right products to drive high quality account growth. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We expect the investments we are making today to generate higher net interest revenue overtime as growth in active accounts, better customer engagement, and higher purchase sales translated to higher full rate balances. We feel good about our progress to date of nearly 6% year-over-year growth in active accounts and 12% growth in purchase sales in our core products. Of course this has the revenue growth in cards will take some time and the full benefits of our actions may not be completely reflected in our results for perhaps another two years as we build new loans to offset the continued run off in our legacy products. In the interim we will benefit from inorganic growth next year with the acquisition of the Costco portfolio. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Finally, turning to retail services, revenues declined 2% from last year reflecting the continued impact of lower fuel prices as well as higher contractual partner payments, as we continued to share some of the benefits of higher yields and lower net credit losses with our retail partners. Excluding the impact of loan loss reserves, pretax income grew 7% in retail services. Total expenses of 2.3 billion in North America declined 6% as incremental investments were more than offset by lower repositioning cost and ongoing efficiency savings, as we have continued to capture scale benefits in cards and rationalize our branch footprint. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Since the beginning of 2014 we have closed or sold over 200 branches and plan to exit roughly 50 more by the end of the first quarter of 2016 including our Boston area branches. With these actions we are concentrating our presence in our most productive urban markets and also adjusting our model to reflect a significant shift in transaction activity to digital channels requiring fewer branches and lower headcount per branch. This shift also improves our ability to retain customer relationships as the physical footprint changes. Even when we exit the market entirely, we have found that we are able to retain a significant portion of the consumer deposits overtime. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Slide 10 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail. Asia credit was stable again this quarter with a loss rate of roughly 80 basis points. The loss rate in North America continued to decline to 2.2%. And both the NCL and delinquency rates improved again this quarter in Latin America driven by favorable trends in our Mexico cards portfolio that we expect to continue. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Slide 11 shows the expense trends for global consumer banking. For the first nine months of the year the total efficiency ratio for global consumer banking was 53% down from 55% last year. And we expect the ratio to be roughly 53% for the full year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning now to the institutional clients group on slide 12, revenues of 8.4 billion in the third quarter declined 3% from last year. Total banking revenues of 4 billion excluding the impact of gains on loan hedges were down 7% versus the prior year, mostly reflecting lower investment banking activity. Treasury and trade solutions revenues of 1.9 billion were flat year-over-year on a reported basis. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In constant dollars TTS revenues grew 7% from last year as growth in deposit balances and spreads more than offset a decline in trade revenues. This represents the seventh consecutive quarter that we\u2019ve generated both revenue and operating margin growth in TTS on a year-over-year basis. Investment banking revenues of 937 million were down 25% from last year. Equity underwriting revenues were down 43% reflecting lower industry wide activity this quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Debt underwriting revenues were down 17% driven by high yield and leverage loans, products where our core clients were less active this quarter than in the prior year. And M&amp;A revenues were down 24% compared to a very strong quarter last year. Year-to-date in 2015 we have continued to gain momentum in M&amp;A with 16% revenue growth, sustained wallet share gains, and a strong share of announced value. Private bank revenues of 715 million grew 8% year-over-year driven by strong growth in managed investments revenue as well as higher loan and deposit balances. And corporate lending revenues of 403 million were down 9% on a reported basis. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">In constant dollars lending revenues declined 4% from last year as higher volumes were more than offset by lower spreads and the impact of loan sale activity. Total markets and securities services revenue of 4 billion declined 5% year-over-year. Fixed income revenues of 2.6 billion were down 16% as we saw lower activity levels and a less favorable environment in the recent quarter particularly in securitized products in G10 FX. The revenue impact was most significant in North America and Western Europe and was partially offset by strong performance again this quarter in our emerging markets franchise where our fixed income revenues grew 4% year-over-year. Our G10 rates business as roughly flat year-over-year for the quarter but we did see significantly lower than expected revenues in the back half of September. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Turning to equities, excluding the impact of reversing $140 million of the valuation adjustment we recognized in the second quarter, revenues increased by 12% from last year driven by growth in derivatives with particular strength in North America and Asia. And in security services revenues declined 4% on a reported basis and were up 7% in constant dollars, reflecting increased activity and higher client balances. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Total operating expenses of 4.7 billion decreased 4% year-over-year as higher regulatory and compliance cost were more than offset by lower compensation expense and the impact of FX translation. Total credit costs were 309 million up sequentially reflecting a net loan loss reserve build this quarter compared to a net release last quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">In both quarters we built reserves for energy related exposures. However the build was more than offset last quarter by reserve releases in other portfolios. In the third quarter we built energy related reserves of roughly $140 million or about half of the total ICG build. The remainder was split between other portfolios and the impact of overall volume growth. Of course we are working closely with our clients to mitigate the risk of losses actually being realized. Total net credit losses were $34 million this quarter and while corporate non-accrual loans increased during the quarter, more than two thirds of the loans we added remained performing. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On slide 13, we show expense and efficiency trends for the institutional business. Over the last 12 months our efficiency ratio was 57% including over 100 basis points attributable to legal and repositioning charges. And our comp ratio was 27%. We continued to expect to achieve a total ICG efficiency ratio in the range of 55% to 56% for the full year 2015. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Slide 14 shows the results for corporate and other. Revenues were higher year-over-year driven primarily by gains on debt buybacks and expenses were down mainly reflecting lower legal and related costs. Slide 15 shows holdings assets which totaled $110 billion at quarter end, down 20% from a year ago. We have continued to make great progress in opening down Citi Holdings with signed agreements to selling additional $37 billion of assets, $31 billion of which we currently expect to close in the fourth quarter. By year-end we currently expect Citi Holdings assets to be somewhere in the range of $70 billion to $75 billion. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On slide 16, we show Citi Holdings financial results for the quarter. Revenues of 1.4 billion declined 32% from last year mostly reflecting lower gains on asset sales as well as divestiture activity. Expenses also declined driven mainly by the lower assets and cost of credit remains favorable driven by the North American mortgage portfolio where the total NCL rate improved to 1.2%. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On slide 17, we show Citigroup's net interest revenue and margin trends. The bars represent net interest revenue per day for each quarter in constant dollars showing a consistent growth trend year-over-year even as the contribution from Citi Holdings has continued to shrink. Our net interest margin was 294 basis points in the third quarter, roughly in line with the prior quarter as trading NIM continued to be higher than expected. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Looking to the fourth quarter, our net interest margin will depend on a number of factors including the level of trading them, the timing of expected divestitures in Citi Holdings, and a magnitude in timing of any debt redemption actions. Given all that we currently expect our net interest margin in the fourth quarter to be in the range of 285 to 290 basis points. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On slide 18 we show our key capital metrics on a fully implemented basis. During the quarter our CET1 capital ratio improved to 11.6% driven by retained earnings and DTA utilization even as we return $2.1 billion to shareholders in the form of share buybacks and common dividends. Our supplementary leverage ratio improved to 6.8% and our tangible book value grew to over $60 per share. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">In summary we continue to operate well in a challenging environment this quarter with continued cost discipline, significantly lower legal and repositioning cost, and great progress towards the wind down of Citi Holdings. Three quarters into the year we have an efficiency ratio in Citicorp of 55.4%, a Citigroup ROA of 99 basis points, and we earn the return on tangible common equity of 10%. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We continued to utilize our deferred tax assets this quarter and we ended the period with a very strong capital position. We are certainly seeing the impact of slower global growth and macro uncertainty on our top line results, but we feel good about our ability to manage risk through this cycle. We are remaining disciplined on target client strategy and feel strongly to focusing on these higher quality and more resilient segments is the right strategy in any economic environment. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Looking to the fourth quarter, in North America consumer revenues will likely be roughly flat to the third quarter and in international consumer we expect revenue to be slight to slightly higher than last year on a constant dollar basis as we expect continued modest volume growth with Asia revenues beginning to stabilize. Turning to the institutional franchise, we continue to see good momentum across treasury and trade solutions, security services, and the private bank which together generated 8% year-over-year revenue growth in the first nine months of the year in constant dollars. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Investment banking revenues will depend in part on the overall market but we continue to feel good about the strength of our franchise particularly in M&amp;A. And finally in markets we expect our overall performance to reflect the market environment with the goal of continuing to gain wallet share with our target clients.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">In Citi Holdings there are series of transactions that will impact the fourth quarter. As I noted earlier we currently expect to close roughly $31 billion of previously announced asset sales including our retail and cards businesses in Japan and one main financial. We will continue with other ongoing portfolio of sales and we also plan to redeem high cost debt. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">As we have said previously we expect the net gain on the sale of OneMain to be roughly $1 billion including the cost of planned debt redemption actions. In addition, we expect to incur gains and losses on other sales including some that maybe recognized through the cost of credit like and we expect to see higher transaction related repositioning and other expenses as we are up. And so on a net basis including the impact of all of these other transaction related items we would not expect the full $1 billion gain on OneMain to fall through the bottom lot. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Finally for total Citigroup we expect our cost of credit to be roughly flat to the third quarter excluding any impact from the portfolio of sales out of Citi Holdings. And with that Mike and I are happy to take any questions. </p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p6\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">[Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Hey, good morning guys. Just maybe a model question. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael L. Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Good morning Jim.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Hey good morning. Just the asset sales, 31 billion this quarter, potentially 37 billion in total, can you help us think about the impact on capital ratios when they are done?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John C. Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Well when you take a look at, I gave you that where I thought that Citi Holdings would end up on a total asset basis, GAAP asset basis for the end of the quarter or somewhere in that range of $70 billion to $75 billion of assets. So, we will certainly see a reduction but as we have said in the past particularly the Japan retail business is not risk asset heavy. So, associated with that is $31 billion worth of sales, you are looking at something that might be roughly half of that in risk weighted assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Right, okay. That is helpful, and I guess as we think about even though that is not a huge impact is that, I mean your capital ratios have expanded pretty significantly over the past 12 months. I know this is not a easy question to answer but if you look at your capital return, payout ratio is still below peers with the improvement in ratios sort of now better than most with asset sales, do you think you can get closer to peer payout ratios next year in CCAR or is there anything else we should be thinking about?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael L. Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Jim, it is Mike. I would answer that a couple of ways, one is as long as the stock continues to trade below tangible book our primary actions are going to be focused on share buyback rather than dedicating that right now towards dividend. And again we -- as our capital numbers speak, we had another strong quarter, we have had a strong year-to-date in terms of capital generation, and we have got to position the firm overtime to bring that capital back or we are simply creating our own denominator problem. So, we are focused on it. We don\u2019t know CCAR scenarios, we don\u2019t know all the processes yet but again we are very focused on it. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay, fair enough, I will stop there, thanks. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Hi, thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John C. Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Hi Glenn. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Hello there. I guess I wanted to start with credit and energy specifically. I mean the performance overall has been great. I hear your comments, and I have heard past comments about mostly investment grade, largely large corporate. I am just, I am sitting back and I listened to some of our energy team and they talked about the death and destruction in the oil patch and I see the large numbers that large banks like yours have and I am trying to square the circle there and say why should we feel good about future reserves or current reserves on the energy books. So, I guess let's just revisit why we take comfort in your exposures and then maybe you could help with talking through what you do have reserved away exposures are, I would appreciate it, thanks?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John C. Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Alright Glenn, so again as we have said in the past, and I will give you a bit of a run down, our energy related loans, the total exposure remains about constant to where we were last year at about $60 billion worth of total energy related exposure. The funded book has actually gone down slightly to $21 billion during the quarter. And the book does remain primarily investment grade. We have had some downgrades, we have also taken on some new business which in this market you can imagine is not necessarily at the same high level. But the overall book remains two thirds investment grade, down a little bit from -- the funded book remains two thirds investment grade and the overall exposure is still about 80% investment grade. So we feel very good about the credit quality. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Having said that we continue to work with our clients. We have been building reserves because it certainly is prudent in this environment. We told you that we took a 140 of reserves this quarter, that is roughly equal to what we took during the first half of the year. We took about 100 in the first quarter, 40 in the second. So this is something that we are looking at every day and we are adjusting the provisions accordingly. But it still remains a very high quality book and not one that is necessarily dramatically dependent on the specific price of that. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Again our exposure, to what you would consider to be close to the well head you know still remains fairly small. Roughly confident about a funded book of about $6 billion and we\u2019ve worked our way through a lot of the reconsideration events of the taking a look at reserve levels. So again all I can say is that it is something that we are looking at and it is something that we still feel really good about. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay, that\u2019s always helpful. One other question I had is just a more high level of which ways do we see your SLR premium ratio as an advantage and there is lot of downsize in Europe, lot of people trying to optimize their own balance sheets, where can we see that playing the role as a positive to help you bring on books of business and just be like basically the high bid?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael L. Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Well we don\u2019t always want to be the highest bid there. We like to get business at a reasonable price but you are right we do have a certain advantage with the SLR ratio and we feel that we are using that appropriately. Of course SLR is one ratio, you also take into account what we are doing on all the other ratios. But for instance the strength that we have got on our SLR ratio has enabled us to pursue a little bit more growth in the prime brokerage area and we see that as a way of getting additional penetration into some of our key investor clients. So again we are using it where appropriate but everything that we do is carefully thought out on several plains as you can imagine. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yes, I appreciate that, okay. Thank you. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hi, can you just elaborate a bit on why the NIM will be down 5 to 10 basis points what the assumed timing of the OneMain and balance sheet restructuring is part of that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John C. Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Why NIM is downsided.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I am sorry, I think the outlook for 4Q is for the net interest margin percent to be down 5 to 10 basis points and there is obviously a lot of moving pieces that\u2019s going to impact that. But how do we think about core NIM overlaying the impact of OneMain to debt restructuring. I am trying to figure out if it is down that much because of those transactions or is that down that much kind of on a core basis?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John C. Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">No, what we\u2019ve said in the past Matt is that both the Japan retail business as well as OneMain are high NIM producing businesses. So those are high NIM producing businesses and as we shed those businesses that\u2019s going to have an impact on our NIM and take it down several basis points. I can\u2019t remember the exact number that we gave you last quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Unfortunately I can\u2019t predict the timing of the sales when they will occur in the fourth quarter. So the fourth quarter is going to be somewhat of a transition quarter regarding NIM which is why I am giving you a range of 285 to 290. Once we cross the fourth quarter we\u2019ll be able to give you better guidance as to how NIM will progress in the future including don\u2019t forget we\u2019ll be bringing on the Costco portfolio in the second quarter of next year, so that would give us the ability to recapture a portion of that NIM that we are losing through the OneMain sale. And we will also make some of it back through debt buybacks, etc. but I apologize, the fourth quarter is going to be a little bit noisy from a NIM point of view and it is really going to be dependent upon the timing of all of those actions. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So as you think about the exit level of this year of the net interest margin, essentially a good kind of 1Q 2016 level, just holding rates, holding mix, and holding all that steady how would that NIM compare to the current third quarter NIM or what you are expecting in 4Q?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John C. Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Again I\u2019ll be in a much better position to give you that type of guidance and we will give you that type of guidance when we get finished with the fourth quarter and I know when these sales have closed and what impact they will then have on our reported NIM.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay, and then just separately the Costco deal you mentioned the portfolio coming on in the second quarter has that been finalized in terms of pricing and everything?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John C. Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">No, it still hasn\u2019t been finalized yet. Obviously we are still in a process, working through a process with AMEX and with Costco and with Visa, all being guided by the terms of the contracts that exists currently between AMEX and Costco and that is really all I can say about that. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay, alright, thank you. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John C. Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Alright. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Good morning. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael L. Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Hi.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So in the -- just following up on the Holdings questions in the sale of assets that you expect to close here in the fourth quarter, is there an updated sense about how much of the expense base of Holdings should come out on the back of this?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John C. Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">We haven't given that guidance. We will give you a better sense again after these deals close. You can imagine that associated with certain of these deals there are continuing transaction service arrangements where for a period of time we will be in a position of supporting the buyer with that business which means that we will retain a certain amount of the expense base into the future for which we will be paid. So, again once we determine the timing of all of these transactions and we finalize the terms of the sale including any ongoing service arrangements, I will be in a much better position to give you guidance on the impact on the Holdings expense base. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay, thank you. And then thinking about another exit but more recently announced Boston, can you give some color maybe on how much you think that might impact the North American GCB efficiency ratio or any other metrics?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John C. Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Well I told you where we expect to end the year with the efficiency ratio global consumer and that's really what we are focused on. We intend to end there at 53% of that that we basically have now. And we haven\u2019t given any future guidance on operating efficiency ratios but it is safe to assume that in the current environment we are looking to maintain those efficiency ratios in the ranges that we have said that are our targets. So the exit of Boston is part of that overall consideration and so I wouldn\u2019t think about it as being any more accretive to the year-end target of 53% that I gave you earlier. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Sure, I wasn\u2019t referring to a go forward rather than the year end but let me try a similar idea but maybe in a broader scope, so when we think about the efficiency ratio here and if we think about a revenue environment which is clearly difficult, I know you made reference in the past to the efficiency and then the need for revenue. But if the environment remains difficult, do you have the ability to pull levers and work the efficiency ratio down further from here or are we going to be in a waiting game until the revenues can come through, just how should we think about that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John C. Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I don\u2019t want you to feel as though you are in a waiting game but what we have said is that we intend to operate the business with an efficiency ratio. And the efficiency ratio target that we have put out for Citicorp and we have put this out more than two and half years ago now, when we were looking at what we thought would be a difficult environment in 2015 and the environment has actually proved to be even more difficult I think than we thought at that point in time when we said we can operate overall Citicorp with an efficiency ratio of in the mid 50s. And that's where we are. And given this environment we still feel, again we haven\u2019t worked our way all the way through our budget considerations and everything else but in this type of environment we think that that is a pretty good efficiency ratio to be operating under. And it takes a lot of management in this type of environment to continue to operate at that efficiency ratio and still have room to make the investments that you want us to make so that when the environment improves we can generate even higher levels of revenue growth. So, all of that is tied up in those efficiency ratio targets that we have put out there. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay, I guess last one from me then if we think about your new card offering how is it that you would recommend we measure success based upon the change, the new products that you\u2019ve put out the \u2013 the offering what metrics would you guys us to look to if some of the components of the environment for revenue remain challenging?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John C. Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">The metric that will guide you to and will begin to give you more of this probably next quarter, we\u2019ll be taking a look at our active accounts. I think that is where we\u2019re seeing the big difference. I mentioned active accounts are up 6% year-over-year and that\u2019s a big change for us. As I said we were struggling before to maintain a steady state of active accounts and so to see active accounts up 6% this year now basically compared to last year, that\u2019s pretty sizeable growth for us. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I talked about the fact that acquisitions on our core products were up 37% on a year-to-date basis. But having those acquisitions is good, having those acquisitions really transition into active accounts is where we need to be, and that\u2019s clearly where we have gotten to now and where we are going to keep on driving. So we\u2019ll give you metrics on active accounts. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Thanks for that John. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John C. Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Not a problem. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Thank you. John, just wondering on expenses, the year-over-year constant dollar expense trends look good. You are down 13% year-over-year. It is harder for us to kind of tease out how much of that was from lower legal and repositioning to compare to core expense, could you shed any light on that on how the core expenses trend on a constant dollar basis?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John C. Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">You know core expenses are up slightly and again it\u2019s in line with the plans that we had going into this year when we thought about what we needed to do in order to generate the efficiency ratios that we were targeting. So again a plus slightly but all included in the efficiency ratio target that we gave. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay and as you look ahead to the fourth quarter any thoughts on the core expenses, we can probably be in the same neighborhood are there any puts and takes to think about?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John C. Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Well it is going to vary business by business and everything. For instance in some of the businesses where we\u2019ve seen some of the revenue challenges, for instance some of the international consumer businesses, you can imagine that we have already begun to look at the core expenses there and have begun to adjust the trajectory. So these are all things that we look at. I am not going to give you specific guidance on exactly where core expenses is going to be. But again what we\u2019re committed to is to deliver on that mid 50s of efficiency ratio for Citicorp. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay and then this question is for Mike following up on your comments about using excess capital and trying to avoid the denominator problem. You have become more interested in trying to grow assets in organically as your capital grows and perhaps you get more comfortable with the regulatory rules and whether its card portfolios or consumer books. Is that something that you look more to in trying to grow through portfolio acquisitions? </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael L. Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I think John we\u2019ve been open to those acquisitions whether it was best buy or whether it will be Costco. But all of those need to be in our targeted segments. You are not going to see us going out breaking into a new products or things that we don\u2019t view today as really being core who we are as a franchise and whether that\u2019s the client segment or whether that\u2019s by geography or industry or whatever it maybe. But we are wide open to those portfolio acquisitions and if they hit our ROA and our return metrics and we think risk adjusted they make sense. We\u2019ll certainly look at them but again what we have really tried to build our business model around is just really driving our own organic core growth off of our existing platforms. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay, thanks. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Hi, when will we hear about new targets for 2016 and what -- can you give us a preview?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael L. Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Sure, well first as you can imagine in this environment we are really focused on delivering 2015 and our targets around that. So it will be some time as we get into the new year. We haven\u2019t set a date as to when we will do that. John said we are heading into budget season and we will be looking both at 2016 and some planning beyond that. I would say that some preview around that Mike is that, as John said, that when we went into these targets two to three years ago we said it is a tough environment. It is probably stayed as tough or tougher both from an economic or regulatory just overall backdrop than we had even thought at the time. It certainly doesn\u2019t feel like it is going to get a whole lot better here for a period of time. So I wouldn\u2019t expect big changes to those targets. Our goal is to manage the institution well through the environment we are in and be in a position to deliver strong performance, strong operating leverage, and all the things you would expect as the environment at some point in the future starts to turn. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So how much does getting where you want to be depend on higher U.S. interest rates?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael L. Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Well it is certainly -- it certainly hasn\u2019t been a help in terms of where we are. And where we are as we said we would get and run the institution to the mid 50s and again I think as you look across the industry it leaves us in a reasonable position. We have talked about changes in interest rates and as of now roughly 100 basis points upward shift of rates translate somewhere into about 2 to 2.1 of revenue which we would hope we believe largely translates into EBIT and so they are tailwinds that can come out of some of those shifts. But again as we have seen, as the Fed has contemplated its move you would want those moves to come on the back drop of perception of economic strength. And if economic strength is there you get the double tailwind of not just the rate push but you get some stability, you get some markets trending, you get some confidence back in the market that I think would be welcomed by both consumers as well as the institutions and corporate. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I mean is it fair for us to expect to a little bit higher returns. I mean you are shedding some non-core assets, you are repositioning the firm, you just announced you are retreating some from Boston and I guess Korea has passed some of the restructuring. I mean is it fair for us to expect a bit more if you look out?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael L. Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I think a lot of that Mike depends on the environments there. But what you can expect is that we are going to continue to closely manage the place and we are going to keep an eye. And management has a strong eye towards the targets that we have put out there delivering on those and continuing as I said in opening remarks not just around expenses but around risk of capital to try and manage the place smartly. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And then last follow-up. The IMF and other forecasters have reduced their growth rate for Asia and this quarter saw some pull back in China markets but here you are saying on this call that Asia consumer is stabilizing, so can you help me with that disconnect?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John C. Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">When you take a look at the IMF, they have lowered their growth forecast but they are still forecasting growth. And when you take a look at our Asia consumer revenues we believe that they will stabilize. They are stabilizing now and they should stabilize going into the fourth quarter and then into next year. So, I don\u2019t think that those two things are inconsistent. I would like to get more growth out of Asia but with the lowered -- with everybody sort of living in a lower GDP environment, getting high levels of growth is going to be difficult even with the levels that you are seeing, that we are seeing now. Again we are still getting good engagement on loans, on deposits, so it is not that we are not seeing some levels of growth even at this point in time. </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Alright, thank you. </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Thank you. Good morning guys. Can you show where -- the Citi Holdings as you bring the assets down, I think you pointed out that today the assets represent about 6% of total assets and 13% of risk weighted assets. So clearly there is more capital supporting the Holdings suite we have always known about. Do you think that when you bring it down actually to zero, will all that capital be freed up or is there some operational risk that the regulators will require you to maybe keep more capital in there as the assets are no longer there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John C. Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes I\u2019d say that is the most likely case Gerard. So when you think about Citi Holdings, Citi Holdings at the end of the quarter had about $157 billion worth of risk weighted assets, at the end of the third quarter Mike. It was $157 billion of risk weighted assets and in that $157 billion consistent with what we said at the end of the second quarter there is about $49 billion worth of risk weighted assets associated with operating risk. And I just don\u2019t think that we\u2019re going to get to a point where even if we shut holdings down that we are going to be able to relieve ourselves of that $49 billion of risk weighted assets. So that may come overtime but it\u2019s going to be time not a quarter or two. So I think it is really, you really need to look at the $108 billion then of credit and market risk assets that are supporting to the holdings as really being the opportunity that we have now for further capital reduction and as we wind down the balance of the holdings. </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Would there be -- thank you for the clarity there. Would there be any operating expenses that have to stick around with that 49 billion of the operating risk assets, when Citi Holdings assets all go to zero would you still have to have some operating expenses to support that 49 billion?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John C. Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">No, we shouldn\u2019t. We have been pretty good at making sure we attack any stranded costs in holdings as we\u2019ve gotten rid of the assets. And this 49 billion it will be driven based upon model. At some point in time we had businesses that generated of operating risk events and it is just going to take time then to have that fade into the past. And then the time frame is just one that we\u2019ll have to work through our own models and then certainly with some of our regulatory friends. </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Great and shifting gears you mentioned in your prepared remarks about card loans, they grew modestly year-over-year but the growth was muted by the impact of continued high payment rates than regulatory changes. They both remain headwinds but you then went on to say that you think that the regulatory changes there might be some abatement in this in the upcoming year or was that more just due to the high payment rates that you think that could slowdown to help the growth?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John C. Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And I think you quoting me from the comments that I made about Asia specifically. And in Asia we had almost every country in Asia implement some version of the U.S. Card Act during the past two years. And so what we have been doing is working our way then through those impacts on the Asia card book, whether that\u2019s higher payment rates, whether that\u2019s lower debt ceilings, items like that. So that has been working its way through the book and what we are looking at now is that the impact of those regulations are abating both because there are not so many new regulations coming new, and also because we are lapping the impact of the changes that were put in place a year or two ago. So both of those factors give us again some of the confidence that those impacts will be lessening as we look forward. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And then finally on cards you mentioned that the revenues in branded cards was down about 9% and this was due to the increase in acquisition and reward cost. How long did they last and is that primarily from when you buy a new portfolio or is there an ongoing cost as well just going out reaching out for new customers?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John C. Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">No, this is the cost of growing accounts organically. Two different models as far as inorganic and organic growth but when you get into an organic growth model which is where we are right now predominantly we will get as I mentioned a boost from inorganic growth we had in the Costco portfolio so that will be a big plus. But from an organic point of view the first thing we did is we had to restructure the product offering in cards which I think we have successfully done. And we have gotten a nice balance now of new products dealing with both the value product, rewards product, the value product will be simplicity, the rewards product would be thank you. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">We have introduced double cash giving us a cash back product and so we got a nice balance there between cards that appeal to spend oriented consumers and revolve oriented consumers. We have got a nice balance on our product portfolio between proprietary cards and co-brand cards and now it is a matter of putting investment dollars at work to grow -- to first acquiring new accounts, have them transition into active customers, and then gross spend and revolve behavior on each one of those cards. And so the first phase that you run into once you have restructured is you get into a rebate and reward phase where as you add in those accounts there are certain amount of cost that you incur upfront to acquire the account, all those rebates, and they basically hit your revenue line. As well as then the rewards cost that you pay as they continue to drive spend early on and that also was a, is a muting factor on your revenue line as well. So, once we get through with the -- that will eventually pace itself out and we will go from rebates and rewards and then we will get into a revolving period as well. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Thank you for the clarity, I appreciate it. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John C. Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Not a problem. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Erika Najarian</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Hi, and just one quick follow-up from me, the roughly 400 million that you called out John and quarterly increase in corporate non-accruals in North America and EMEA, what percentage of that increase quarter-over-quarter was related to energy?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John C. Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Roughly 80% of the net add was energy related. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Erika Najarian</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Got it, thank you. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John C. Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Not a problem.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ken Usdin</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Hi, thanks. John, just on the debt buyback front can you help us understand as to how much the benefit was this quarter and if the premise of doing more in the future is also baked into your expectation for the future NIM?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John C. Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">The impact of the debt buybacks is incorporated in my 285 to 290 range. You know obviously debt buybacks you get a certain benefit in the quarter in which you do it but it is usually more of a forward-looking benefit. And debt buybacks is just one of the tools that we use as far as active management of our long-term debt portfolio. We find series of debt that just are not particularly trading well and that gives us an opportunity then to buy that back and then usually it ends up giving us the opportunity then to reissue that at better rate. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ken Usdin</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And was that a modest benefit this quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John C. Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">We had certain, I haven\u2019t been able to isolate it in my head anyway the impact of debt buybacks on this quarters NIM but I am sorry, it is blended in with our overall cost of funding which did come down. And that is something that is really going to -- that is going to trickle in over many, many quarters. </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ken Usdin</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Got it, so it has got a card order which is going to be my follow-up, because I would think you would see a kind of -- you really see it in the cost of debt on the liability side of the average balance sheet page. So I was just wondering if how much benefit you could still get from that going forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John C. Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Well again a lot of that is going to depend on how markets perform and everything else. We have been fairly successful in the past dealing with the debt buybacks. It is something that we look to do. If it is there it is there. </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ken Usdin</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay, got it. And then just a follow up question on the international consumer banking side and to your point about flat year-over-year constant dollar, and your comments about the investments sales slowing, any sense if that investments have slow down, was kind of just customers freezing given what was happening this quarter and what are you seeing just in terms of the international consumer activity aside from revenue just in terms of the behavior and activity as you look ahead?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John C. Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Activity level obviously it is going vary a little bit region by region but a lot of our wealth management business its concentrated in Asia and there it's very much to your point. What we see in times of market volatility and market uncertainty is that our wealth management clients are not as active as you would imagine. It is just not as active in putting more of their funds to work in the markets and that therefore has an impact on our investment sales. So it\u2019s a little bit of market sentiment, it\u2019s a little bit of consumer confidence, its all of those things and as far as how does what do we think about it going forward at the markets sort of clear themselves as people become a little bit more confident again, they know where they are going. We see that activity come back but this was a particularly tough quarter for investment sales. </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ken Usdin</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Right, okay, got it. Thanks very much. </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John C. Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Not a problem. </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead. </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Hi, good morning. John I had a quick question on risk weighted assets and just wanted to clarify couple of things relating to the disclosure in the release or in the presentation. So it looks as though the headline number has declined about 4% year-on-year but just looking at the capital impact disclosure which maybe reflect some FX related impacts, its looks as though the RWA on a constant dollar basis have been relatively stable. I just wanted to get a sense as to how we should be thinking about it in 2016 where maybe you don\u2019t have the offset of the holdings run off and you still have continued core growth in Citicorp, should we expect those RWAs to begin to trend on an upward trajectory?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John C. Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Let me help you. Let me deal with the sequential decline in risk weighted assets, alright. So, on a sequential basis risk weighted assets dropped from I don\u2019t have the page open 12.79 to 12.58, about $21 billion. And roughly half of that decline was FX related, alright. So, don\u2019t forget we take that into consideration as part of our overall capital hedging program because our capital hedging program is built on a ratio hedge. So we hedge to our CET1 ratio. And so just as our capital in various countries is going to be impacted by fluctuations in FX rates, we also know that our risk weighted assets are going to be impacted by that as well. So all of that is baked into capital hedge. But that means that for the quarter we actually saw a non-FX related reduction in RWA of about $10 billion. So that\u2019s what's baked into that number and some of that is in holdings and some of that is in Citicorp. </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">In general again we do expect to see Citi Holdings continue to reduce. That should give us room to grow Citicorp. We have not worked our way through our overall 2016 plan as yet. so I cannot give you guidance as to where we are going to think about what we are going to think about RWA levels going into next year. But we\u2019ll take all of that into account as we finalize the budget and as the budget gets finalized around both our efficiency targets as well as our ROA targets and our ROPCE targets as well. </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Well thank you for detail there John and just wanted to switch gears for a moment. I appreciate the color that you had given on Brazil in terms of some of the consumer exposures there, one of the things I was hoping you can give some priority or detail on as rolling into corporate exposure specifically, well it looks like Brazil is about 5% of the total loan book. I know in the past the disclosures you\u2019ve given suggest that the majority of those corporates are actually based in Brazil in lieu of other regions or maybe its predominantly multinationals. I want to get a sense as to how your -- what the credit trends look like today, how they are performing, and whether you start to reserve for any potential losses within the institutional segment. </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John C. Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Our Brazil book is structured in a very similar along the line of every other country in which we operate which is that it is a book that really again focuses on those large multinationals and again it is somewhat similar. We take all of that into account, we certainly been on the wait to see that S&amp;P downgraded Brazil before we began to take a look at some of our Brazil book and build the appropriate reserves. </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">But again it is a consistent strategy, large multinational corporates, global investors. At the end of the third quarter we had total exposure of $14.5 billion or so in Brazil and most of that, 75% of the corporate lending book is as you said is the Brazil based companies and a large portion of the book, more than half, well more than half, I think it is like 60%, 70% is TTS related. So it is trade related loans. So you have a combination of short dated secured loans on TTS, large multinationals, I am not going to tell you that the book will never have an NCL but we feel pretty good about the quality of the book. </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Excellent and then just one more from me John and obviously you are getting a bit knit picky here but it did sound as though the guidance you have given on the full year efficiency range for ICG is 55% to 56%. I do believe on the last quarter's call you had said the midpoint of the 53% to 57% target range which is just maybe some upward pressure on the efficiency ratio and I just wanted to guess as to whether that is a reflection of revenue pressures. I know that revenues on a constant dollar basis were down about 1% year-on-year through the first nine months or more a function of what you are seeing in terms of the performance thus far, maybe your outlook ahead of the fourth quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John C. Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yeah, I think the language that we had last time was closer to the midpoint as opposed to specifying the midpoint. So, you can assume that this is, I am thinking that we are going to be slightly above where I would have targeted at the end of the last quarter and it very much reflects the revenue pressure that --</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay, well thanks for clarifying that John. And\u2026</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John C. Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Having said that it is somewhere between 55% and 56% compares really well with our peers. </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Tangible [ph] rate, thanks John for taking my questions. </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John C. Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Not a problem. </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Hi, good morning. </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John C. Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Hi Betsy. </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So, just a couple of follow-ups, one is on corporate, I was going to ask the question about corporates in Asia, you mentioned the slightly softer growth coming out of the consumer, just wanted to get a sense as to how corporates are trending because what we are hearing from folks is that there is a little bit of softer demand given China is not doing as much?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael L. Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Betsy, it is Mike. I would say that that's accurate. That there is this activity on the corporate side of the loans and just overall calendar has slowed a bit. That being said, John talked about other parts of our business there in particular our EM sales and trading businesses and our EM sales and trading business in Asia has actually been quite strong. So while headline volumes have slowed, you can imagine through our TTS business, our foreign exchange business in some of those markets, more activity as company's try and position and spend more time focusing on the balance sheet directory running in those companies. So, a bit of in and out but yes, the region is not escaping the slowdown. </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And then just a question on your bond portfolio that you manage globally, I am just wondering are there any opportunities to optimize your investments across geographies or the investments are really just -- in each of the countries that you are generating that deposit flow from?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael L. Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">You know Betsy, it is a little bit of both. Alright, so obviously we have got a bond portfolio that is at the top of the house but we do have bond portfolios in each of the countries. And so within each of the countries we look to optimize within the country and at the top of the house we look to optimize across the institution.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And is there any more that you can do here, I am just thinking about the relative rate environment, could there be some opportunities for incremental optimization and lower rate environment?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John C. Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">You are having the budget discussion that Mike\u2019s going to have with me is to whether or not my treasury unit is doing the right job, did he subcontract this out to you? </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael L. Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Thank you Betsy. </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay thanks. </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John C. Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">The answer Betsy is we look at all this stuff all the time and we\u2019re always finding new things that we can do. So, it is something that we do look at every day but I can't give you a specific answer to is there a lot more than we can do. We think we are doing a lot right now. </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay and then just lastly on the U.S. credit card environment you mentioned that the two years forward is when with the new accounts you get to a better lending environment obviously because at first you get the new accounts in and they spend and then they borrow, I just wanted to understand was that two years to what you think is average run rate in borrowing or in revolving for the accounts that you are looking for, or is that, when you start to see the beginnings of borrowings. So I am just trying to understand what the two year number was about?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John C. Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">We should see as even as early as next year, we should begin to see growth in our overall loan portfolio. So you should start to see average net receivables. First they will stabilize, maybe that will be very early next year and then we should begin to see some growth. But it is going to take almost that full two years before you see the real full impact of everything that we are doing. We\u2019ll be able to show you metrics along the way so that you will be able to gauge just how well we are progressing. I mentioned to one other caller about giving active accounts but you will also see the growth in ANR. But given the heavy impact of that reward and rebate on the top line revenue it is going to take some time. </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">If you think about the 9% down that we have got year-on-year in cards just to maybe give you an example, I\u2019d say about 10% of that decline is environmental, some hangover from regulatory. About 30% of that decline is just the impact of the run off portfolio, the legacy portfolio is running off, and again that will begin to abate as well. But then 60% of that decline is really being caused by this instrument activity that we have. So it won\u2019t always be at that high level but it is going to be at a level for some time. </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I got it, okay, thanks that was very helpful. </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Your next question comes from the line Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Good afternoon, thanks for taking my questions. Just one question on loan growth and sort your outlook into fourth quarter. I guess following up on an earlier comment it seems like while there is continued growth expectations across many of your international markets growth expectations are coming down and you reported core loan growth in Citicorp is being at about mid single-digit, are you expecting that to continue at mid single-digit levels over the next quarter or two or are there markets where you think that could slow down substantially?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John C. Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">You know I don\u2019t want to get into a specific guidance point on loan growth in Citicorp on constant dollars but we do think that again, this quarter it did present certain challenges. I don\u2019t think the environment is going to change dramatically in the fourth quarter. So I wouldn\u2019t look to the fourth quarter as being radically different from what we\u2019ve seen on a sequential basis looking at the third quarter. But again we\u2019ll have to just see how everything continues to develop off of there. What is happening, it is not just of course of the fact that you get loan growth but what also matters is where you get the loan growth and in what loan products do you get loan growth in. And so the key for us is to begin to see the loan growth in those higher margin credit card products. We like to see the loan growth in the retail bank that\u2019s fine but those loans are usually slightly lower margins because they\u2019re securitized. Then there is a fixed payment scheme as opposed to revolving behavior that you have on cards. So loan growth is one thing and I feel pretty good about our ability to grow loans but I feel better when we begin to see even better growth coming out of the card products. </p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay, John thanks, that\u2019s helpful. And then just a very quick follow-up, I just want to make sure I heard you correctly in terms of your commentary about credit cost in the fourth quarter, I believe you said that those would be relatively stable with the levels of the third quarter, is that correct?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John C. Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Other than whatever asset sale impacts we have, some of the asset sales that we\u2019ll be doing out of holdings actually you know the gain or loss gets recognized in that cost of credit line. Outside of those activities it should be stable. </p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay, fair enough. Thank you very much. </p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead. </p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Hi, good morning. I just had two quick questions. On the hedge gains that you called out were those related to the specific sector meaning energy or they region like in Brazil or somewhere else that shows the big gain this quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John C. Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Well I am not going to go into specific things but in general the hedges that we\u2019ve got on our loan book that\u2019s just part of our ongoing risk management efforts. We use loan hedges to manage credit risk concentrations primarily and to the extent that we can and for the most part we do we use single name CDS to hedge those concentration risk. So it is not because we\u2019re worried about any particular name but because we are just trying to manage again our concentration of risk in a particular sector. </p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And so in the third quarter as you saw what happened in the environment, credit spreads were generally widening and that had two impacts. We had gains on those loan hedges and at the same point in time we took provisions on the loans. And it shouldn\u2019t be -- that\u2019s in line with the way that you should expect them. I am not going to say it is always going to line up correctly but I think if you go back to the last two quarters what you\u2019ll see in each of the last two quarters to the extent we had small losses on the loan hedges, that gave us then the opportunity it usually matched up with an opportunity to release reserves in the corporate portfolio and to the extent where we had a small gain, we usually had a small build in the loan loss. Again I am not going to say that its perfectly co-related, but it certainly has been somewhat co-related over the last three quarters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay, that\u2019s helpful, thanks. And just switching gears to the mortgage banking, I know you said you wanted to increase the market share there, back to where you were historically or getting closer to it but looks like Q on years not much changed in the market share, as they just left emphasis on growing markets -- market share and mortgage bank or is it just function of the market?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John C. Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">It is not less emphasis it really is very much a function of the market itself. And there is also so it\u2019s a combination certainly of the market. You\u2019ve also seen I think everyone has seen some of the gains on sale being reduced in the mortgage books. So that\u2019s also having an impact on the overall revenue stream that we are getting out of mortgages. But we\u2019re still focused exactly as we were. We are not trying to be one of the top three or four producers of mortgages but we do want to be in a position to be able to support our retail clients when it comes to their mortgage needs. </p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Good, thanks for taking my questions. </p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John C. Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Not a problem. </p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Your next question comes from the line Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. </p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Thanks very much. John, I just maybe want to consolidate my understanding of your answers to several of the questions that have come before, so just to preface for a quick second, it seems as if the\u2026</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John C. Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">You are not going to go through all 40 questions that have been asked so far are you?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">No, it's just 37 cause couples are repeats. </p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John C. Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay alright. </p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">So it seems as if the overall sort of dynamics is some rebasing of NIM because of change in asset mix and a fairly constant efficiency ratio given the challenges of revenue generation and reinvestment and putting aside maybe some of the volatility in capital markets, it seems then that the primary lever on the income statement for some acceleration in earnings is therefore asset generation, is that correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John C. Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">That is one way of looking at it, yes. </p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And so the -- and so within that, I just want to make sure I understand, it seems that if what you are pointing to as the primary drivers of incremental asset generation meaning beyond the current run rate trends are card in the U.S., retail loan in international consumer, and treasury, PSS, and private bank in ICB is that broadly correct by category?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John C. Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I think what you have isolated on is what we would consider to be our core banking activities which is exactly where we were focused. And don\u2019t forget, everything that we do starts with having a clearly articulated strategy that we have been consistent with for the past five to six years. And that strategy really guides us along the way. </p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">The second thing that we are very, very proud of is the strong balance sheet that we have built and so when you start with a well defined strategy and a strong balance sheet that again then gives you the opportunity to pursue appropriate levels of growth. We have gotten to the point now where our core banking activities; cards, retail, PPS, security services, private bank, corporate lending all of those account for more than 75%, close to 80% of our revenues. And that is where we continue to see our growth coming from in the future. </p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And just in corporate banking, we didn\u2019t hear too much about it on the call, but is there any reason to expect some change in trends line there on quarter review from asset generation perspective?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John C. Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">From asset generation we will continue to support our clients as they need assets whether those be corporate loans or debt or equity underwritings. But our ability to generate assets is really governed by the needs of our clients.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael L. Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And John what we may see to Eric's question is that if and as the markets remain volatile we may see corporates choosing to access the loan market versus the capital markets and maybe transition that over time. So, we have seen some periods of volatility. We will probably be asked to put our balance sheet to work and so you could see loan growth coming through the corporate sector in that form as well. </p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Very interesting, thanks very much. </p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John C. Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Okay. </p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Operator</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">At this time there are no further questions. </p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Susan Kendall</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Thanks Regina and thank you all for joining us here today.

On our call today, our CEO, Mike Corbat, will speak first then John Gerspach, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we'll be happy to take your questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results in capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including without limitation the Risk Factors section of our 2014 Form 10-K. With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Michael Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you, Susan. Good morning everyone. Earlier today, we reported earnings of $3.4 billion for the fourth quarter of 2015 or $1.06 per share excluding the impact of CVA and DVA. And for the full year, we earned $17.1 billion or $5.35 per share. I'll go into more detail on the year after making a few points about the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Overall, our institutional businesses saw improved performance from the fourth quarter of last year. Revenues increased in Treasury and Trade solutions, Investment Banking and our private bank, as well as across our equities and fixed income businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">In Consumer, our North American performance continued to be impacted by investments we're making in our branded cards business, but we saw continued underlying growth and efficiency gains in retail banking.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">And internationally, market sentiment clearly affected our investment sales contributing to lower overall revenues from a year ago. However, we did continue to see growth in deposits, loans, and card purchase sales and credit continued to be stable in our cards and our retail portfolios.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We had a substantial decrease in Citi Holdings assets during the quarter largely driven by the closing of the sale of OneMain and consumer franchises in several countries. Holdings assets ended the year at $74 billion or a 43% reduction from the previous year. And importantly, we believe the actions we took this quarter will enable Citi Holdings to be marginally profitable in 2016.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Overall, we had strong performance in 2015. The $17.1 billion we generated in net income was the highest since 2006 when our company was very different in terms of headcount, footprint, mix of business and assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Over the last year, we grew revenues 3% in constant dollars while holding our core operating expenses flat. And as we committed, we significantly reduced our legal and repositioning costs and we drove loan and deposit growth of 5% in Citicorp, while reducing the overall size of our balance sheet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We also made significant progress on DTA utilization, generating significant regulatory capital and ending the year with a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 12% on a fully implemented basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">I'm especially pleased with our progress over the last three years. In early 2013, in addition to announcing my execution priorities, we set several financial targets we hope to reach by the end of 2015 in terms of return on assets, a Citicorp efficiency ratio and a return on tangible common equity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">At 94 basis points, we reached our target in terms of return on assets, while at 57.1%, the Citicorp efficiency ratio was just over our target and it was more than 300 basis points lower than in 2012. Excellent progress that I think compares very favorably to that of our peers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Although we weren't able to begin to return meaningful capital to our shareholders until 2015, we were still able to increase our return on tangible common equity to 9.2% for Citigroup and we reached 11% excluding the capital which supports our disallowed DTA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In addition to these financial targets, we made significant progress against each of my execution priorities. We've become a simpler and smaller company. We've made the tough decisions regarding what businesses couldn't generate the returns our shareholders expect and deserve.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">And as an example, we've exited or are in the progress of exiting from 19 consumer markets. We said we'd wind down Citi Holdings and drive it to breakeven and now consists of only 4% of our balance sheet and not only as holdings broken even, it\u2019s been profitable for six straight quarters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Overall, we've reduced headcount by 28,000 people, assets by over $130 billion and reduced our legal entities by over one third. We've shrunk our real estate footprint by almost 20%, including 182 operation centers as part of our efforts to establish shared service centers and mine the efficiencies in our opportunities of our business model.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">The other side of the coin is to make sure that we allocate these finite resources to where they can get the best returns. In our Institutional businesses, we've successfully focused on our target clients, achieving wallet share and market share gains.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In Global Consumer, we've reduced our brand's footprint by 25% to concentrate our presence in the fastest growing cities, while investing in our mobile channels. We've simplified our branded cards portfolio reducing our offerings by 60% and are preparing to launch the Costco card this year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Our customer satisfaction is measured by net promoter scores has improved meaningfully. We are unquestionably a safer and stronger company. As 2015 shows, we've significantly improved both the quality and consistency of our earnings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We said we would begin to consistently utilize DTA. After it increased to $55 billion in 2012 we've utilized over $7 billion of DTA in the last three years. This contributed to the generation of $50 billion of regulatory capital over the last three years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Last year, we were able to begin returning some of that capital to our shareholders and we've reduced our outstanding common shares by over 70 million and increased our common dividend.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We've already exceeded regulatory thresholds for the Common Equity Tier 1 and supplementary leverage ratios. We continue to invest in our capital planning process to ensure that it's sustainable and can meet the increasing expectations placed on a bank of our scale and scope.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We've also made the necessary investments in our compliance, risk and control functions which are critical to maintaining our license to do business. Everyday we work to be an indisputably strong and stable institution.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">While as the early days of 2016 have shown, the environment hasn't gotten and isn't likely to get any less challenging. And while there are bright spots such as the US, Mexico or India, growth globally remains muted and makes other factors, whether they be the price of oil or interest rates, difficult to predict.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Volatility may present some trading opportunities but more often keeps investors on the sidelines and dampens consumer sentiment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">As I discussed earlier, we've worked hard to transform our company and the changes we've made have put us in a strong position to navigate the current environment. We've continued to reduce our exposure to lower return consumer markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We run a very balanced and tightly risk managed loan book. We've become even more disciplined in our focus on target clients. And our capital and liquidity are amongst the highest in the industry.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">John will now go through the presentation and then we'd be happy to take your questions. John?</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Starting on slide 3, we highlight the impact of CVA/DVA on our reported results. Excluding this item, we earned $1.06 per share in the recent quarter compared to $0.06 in the fourth quarter of 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On slide 4, we showed total Citigroup results. In the fourth quarter, we earned $3.4 billion. Revenues of $18.6 billion grew 4% from last year, mostly driven by gains on asset sales in Citi Holdings, as well as growth in our institutional franchise, partially offset by the impact of FX translation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In constant dollars, revenues grew 9% year-over-year, including 3% growth in our core Citicorp business. Expenses declined 23% year-over-year driven by lower legal and repositioning charges, as well as a benefit from FX translation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">And net credit losses continued to improve, offset by a significant loan loss reserve build this quarter largely in Citicorp compared to a net release in the prior year. On a full year basis, the total efficiency ratio for Citigroup including Citi Holdings was 57.3%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Net income grew by nearly 50% year-over-year. We generated an ROA of 94 basis points and our return on tangible common equity was 9.2%. In constant dollars, Citigroup end of period loans declined 1% year-over-year to $618 billion, as 5% growth in Citicorp was more than offset by the continued wind down of Citi Holdings and deposits grew 4% to $908 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On slide 5, we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Citicorp revenues of $15.7 billion were down 2% from last year on a reported basis. In constant dollars, as I mentioned, revenues were up 3% from last year driven by growth across our institutional franchise.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Citicorp expenses declined 24% reflecting significantly lower legal and repositioning charges, as well as a benefit from FX translation. And cost of credit grew 29% from the fourth quarter of last year driven by the net reserve build.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to Citi Holdings, we accomplished a lot this quarter. We completed the sales of OneMain, our Japan retail and cards businesses and other assets driving a $36 billion reduction to the end of the year with $74 billion of assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We executed buybacks for roughly $10 billion of outstanding debt and we position Citi Holdings to remain at or above breakeven going forward. The net result of these actions was a pre-tax contribution from Citi Holdings of $1.3 billion this quarter, better than we previously expected, driven by higher net gains on asset sales, as well as improved credit.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">While Citi Holdings did outperform our expectations in the fourth quarter, the greatest driver of earnings growth for the full year was our Citicorp franchise. Citicorp earned $16 billion in 2015, an increase of over $4.8 billion from the prior year, driven by growth in our operating margin, as well as a continued decline in net credit losses, partially offset by the impact of changes in loan loss reserves.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On slide 6, we provide more detail on Citicorp results for full year 2015 in constant dollars. Now going into the year, our goals were to generate top line growth to deliver modest positive operating leverage on our core expense base and to significantly reduce the earnings drag from legal and repositioning costs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">And as you can see on this slide, even in a continued challenging environment, we did achieve each of these objectives for the full year. Citicorp revenues grew 3% while core operating expenses grew only 2%. And our total legal and repositioning expenses fell from over 900 basis points of revenues to roughly 200 basis points.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As a result, our operating efficiency improved from 65% to 57% for the full year 2015. And importantly, we were able to deliver results that better reflect the underlying earnings power of our franchise.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to each business. On slide 7, we show results for International Consumer banking in constant dollars. In total, International Consumer banking revenues declined 2% year-over-year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In Latin America, revenues were flat to last year, as a modest increase in loan and deposit balances was offset by continued spread compression in cards. Card purchase sales continued to grow up 10%, but card loans were flat year-over-year in Latin America driven by higher payment rates in our Mexico cards portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We expect the cards payment rate in Mexico to remain elevated as we continue to focus on higher credit quality segments of the market. We were able to offset this impact however with growth in personal loans and other retail banking products.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to Asia, consumer revenues declined 4% year-over-year driven by continued pressure on investment sales revenues, as well as continued high payment rates and ongoing regulatory pressures in cards.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We saw slightly better momentum in card volumes in the fourth quarter. Payment rates remained fairly stable sequentially and we continued to work through the impact of regulatory changes across the region.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">And in retail banking, we continued to see year-over-year revenue growth in lending, insurance and deposit products. However, this was more than offset by the lower investment sales revenues.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In total, average international loans grew 2% from last year. Card purchase sales grew 5% and average deposits grew 5%. Operating expenses grew 3% as higher regulatory and compliance costs, technology investments and certain one-time items were partially offset by lower legal and repositioning costs, as well as ongoing efficiency savings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">And credit costs increased 8% from last year and 17% sequentially. In credit cards and other retail loans, our NCL and delinquency rates remained broadly stable versus last quarter across the emerging markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">However, we did see an up-tick in net credit losses in certain markets in our Commercial business, which serves small and mid-size companies. And we had a modest reserve build this quarter, as reserve releases are largely behind us as credit has stabilized.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Slide 8 shows the results for North America Consumer banking. Total revenues declined 6% year-over-year and were flat sequentially. Retail banking revenues of $1.3 billion declined 6% from last year including the impact of $130 million gain on the sale of a mortgage portfolio in the prior period. Excluding this gain, retail banking revenues grew 4% reflecting continued loan and deposit growth and improved deposit spreads.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In branded cards, revenues of $1.9 billion were down 9% from last year, driven by a modest decline in average loans and an increase in acquisition and reward costs as we have continued to ramp up new account acquisitions in our core products.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We continue to feel good about the investments we are making with 8% year-over-year growth in active accounts and 13% growth in purchase sales in our core products. We achieved modest year-over-year loan growth this quarter in our core portfolios, which account for roughly 80% of our total US branded card loans.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">And with continued momentum, we believe we should return to growth in both total loans and revenues in the latter part of 2016 before the benefit of acquiring the Costco portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Finally, turning to retail services, revenues declined 1% from last year mostly reflecting the continued impact of lower fuel prices on both loan growth and purchase sales.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Total expenses of $2.4 billion in North America declined 6% driven by lower repositioning costs and ongoing efficiency savings, as we continued to capture scale benefits in cards and rationalize our branch footprint.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">As previously announced, we plan to exit roughly 50 branches in the first quarter of 2016, including our Boston area branches. With these actions, over 90% of our branch footprint will be concentrated in our six key markets where we are investing to deepen our customer relationships and continuing to adapt to a significant shift in customer behavior in digital channels.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Slide 9 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail. Credit was broadly stable in North America and Asia again this quarter with loss rates of 226 and 84 basis points respectively. And in Latin America, we did see an up-tick in the NCL rate to 4.8%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">But as I described earlier, the increase was concentrated in the commercial portfolio including losses on a wind down portfolio in Brazil, most of which were offset by the release of previously established reserves.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Our overall credit outlook remains favorable in Latin America driven by continued stability in our Mexico card portfolio and the benefit of ongoing credit discipline across the region.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Slide 10 shows the expense trends for Global Consumer banking. The total efficiency ratio for Global Consumer banking in 2015 was nearly 54%, above our previous outlook of roughly 53%, driven mostly by lower than expected revenues in our international business, particularly in Asia.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on slide 11. Revenues of $7.4 billion in the fourth quarter grew 4% from last year with broad based growth across the franchise. Total banking revenues of $4.2 billion, excluding the impact of loan hedges, grew 3%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Treasury and trade solutions revenues of $2 billion grew 9% from last year in constant dollars driven by growth in high quality deposits and spreads. This represents the eighth consecutive quarter that we've generated both revenue and operating margin growth in TTS on a year-over-year basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Investment banking revenues of $1.1 billion increased 6% from last year, while our equity underwriting revenues rebounded somewhat from the third quarter, they were down 18% from last year on lower overall industry activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Debt underwriting revenues were up 12% from last year with share gains across debt and loan origination and M&amp;A revenues grew 15%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Private bank revenues of $691 million grew 3% year-over-year, driven by higher loans and deposits. And corporate lending revenues of $401 million were down 7% on a reported basis. In constant dollars, lending revenues declined 2% from last year as higher volumes were more than offset by lower spreads.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Total Markets and Security Services revenues of $3.2 billion grew 9% from last year. Fixed income revenues of $2.2 billion were up 7% from last year with growth in both macro and spread products, but were down 14% from the prior quarter, reflecting seasonally lower activity as well as the impact of continued macro uncertainty.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Turning to equities, revenues grew 29% from a difficult fourth quarter a year ago, driven by growth across products and improved performance in EMEA. And in Security Services revenues grew 2% on a reported basis and were up 12% in constant dollars reflecting increased activity and higher client balances.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Total operating expenses of $4.8 billion declined 1% year-over-year as higher regulatory and compliance costs as well as compensation expense were more than offset by lower repositioning costs, incremental efficiency savings and the impact of FX translation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Total credit costs were $641 million, up from $309 million last quarter, mostly reflecting the impact of loan loss reserve builds. A little more than half of the cost of credit this quarter was energy related.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We incurred roughly $75 million of net credit losses on a limited number of credits in the energy portfolio this quarter, about two thirds of which was offset by related reserve releases.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Excluding the impact of these specific reserve releases, we built roughly $300 million of energy related loan loss reserves this quarter, reflecting our view that oil prices are likely to remain low for a longer period of time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">And we built a similar amount of reserves for other areas of our portfolio. About half of which was related to volume growth and overall macro adjustments, roughly a quarter was related to non-energy credits in Brazil and the remainder was disbursed across other regions and sectors with no particular concentration.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">With these actions completed, we currently believe ICG cost of credit in the first half of 2016 should be more in line with the run rate we saw in the third quarter of 2015 or in other words, credit costs of roughly $600 million in total for the first half.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Taking a step back and looking at the full-year for ICG, we feel good about the progress we are making in our core products. In fixed income, despite the volatile back drop our rates and currencies revenues grew 4% over the prior year with momentum in both local markets and G10 products.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Our local markets rates and currencies business was remarkably stable and profitable franchise again in 2015 generating revenues in the range of $1 billion per quarter. In equities, we grew 13% year-over-year with revenues approaching our near term goal of $800 million to $900 million per quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">M&amp;A revenues grew 16% with sustained wallet share gains for the year. And we saw mid to high single digit revenue growth across TTS, security services and the private bank.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So while we face certain industry wide headwinds in areas like credit and securitized products, we remain focused on our target clients and continued to gain wallet share across the franchise in 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On slide 12, we show expense and efficiency trends for the Institutional business. The total efficiency ratio for ICG in 2015 was 56.7%, a little higher than our previous outlook of roughly 56%, mostly driven by lower than anticipated revenues in the fourth quarter, as well as higher repositioning costs. And our comp ratio was 27%, down from 28% in 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Slide 13 shows the results for Corporate Other. Revenues were higher year-over-year due in part to gains on debt buybacks, and expenses were down, mainly reflecting lower legal and related costs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Slide 14 shows Citi Holdings assets. GAAP assets totaled $74 billion at year end, down over 40% from a year ago. Risk-weighted assets in Citi Holdings came down significantly as well by over $50 billion to $134 billion, with more than a third of this year end amount relating to operational risk.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">As of today, we have signed agreements to reduce Citi Holdings GAAP assets by an additional $7 billion in 2016 and we'll continue to pursue other sales as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On slide 15, we show Citi Holdings financial results for the quarter, which reflect the net gains on asset sales, as well as the impact of our debt buyback activities, legal and repositioning charges, and other episodic items.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">As I described earlier, the net result of these actions was a pre-tax contribution from Citi Holdings of $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter, greater than we had anticipated, driven by higher net gains on asset sales, as well as improved credit.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">But even more important than the fourth quarter impact is what we believe these actions will enable us to achieve in 2016. We currently expect the benefits of lower funding costs, the exit of loss making portfolios and other repositioning efforts to offset virtually all of the operating earnings previously contributed by OneMain.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">As a result, we believe Citi Holdings should be marginally profitable in 2016, and the assets should continue to come down as well with a corresponding benefit to RWA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">On slide 16, we show Citigroup's net interest revenue and margin trends. The bars represent net interest revenue per day for each quarter in constant dollars, showing consistent growth year-over-year in Citicorp, while City Holdings has continued to shrink.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Our net interest margin was 292 basis points in the fourth quarter, somewhat higher than we had anticipated due mostly to trading net interest margin, and our net interest margin for the full-year was 293 basis points.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Looking to 2016, our net interest margin will reflect the loss of OneMain earnings partially offset by the benefit of debt buybacks for a net reduction of about 8 basis points. We should recover about 3 basis points of this impact when we acquire the Costco portfolio which we currently expect to occur closer to the end of the second quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">We also expect to see a benefit from higher rates as we move through the year, but this rate benefit could be all or partially offset if trading NIM normalizes in 2016. Given all of these factors, we would expect our net interest margin to be in the range of about 285 to 290 basis points for the first half of 2016 and then it will reflect Costco in the second half.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">On slide 17 we show our key capital metrics on a fully implemented basis. During the quarter, our CET1 capital ratio increased to 12%, driven by net income and a reduction in risk-weighted assets, partially offset by movements in OCI, as well as $1.8 billion of common share buybacks and dividends.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Our DTA balance grew in the fourth quarter by approximately $600 million, driven by movements in OCI, partially offset by operating earnings. But on a full year basis, we utilized $1.5 billion of DTA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And importantly within our DTA, we reduced our foreign tax credits by roughly $2 billion, thereby fully utilizing FTCs that would have expired in 2017. Our supplementary leverage ratio increased to 7.1% and our tangible book value grew to $60.61 per share.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">To conclude, I'd like to spend some time on our outlook for the coming year. As we look to 2016, we see both opportunities and challenges. We expect the operating environment to remain difficult with uneven global growth, sustained low commodity prices and a slow trajectory for US rate increases.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">But even with this backdrop, similar in many respects to 2015, we believe we can achieve low single digit revenue growth in Citicorp, while staying disciplined around our target client strategy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">We also believe we can drive continued efficiency gains in our core businesses, as we continue to streamline our operations, adjust capacity, and capture the benefits of scale.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">However, we need to carefully balance these ongoing efficiency efforts with the opportunities we see to invest, particularly in highly efficient, higher ROA segments of our franchise.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">The most significant of these planned investments for 2016 are in US cards, including the continued effort to grow active accounts in A&amp;R and branded cards, which as I said earlier, should allow us to return to growth in both loans and revenues by the latter part of 2016.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">The completion of the Costco portfolio acquisition for which we are already ramping up operations, but do not expect to acquire the portfolio until around mid year. And finally, the impact of renewing some important partnership programs in a competitive environment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Together, we believe these investments are important for growing our cards business and for improving our overall Citicorp efficiency and returns over time. However, they will cause a near term drag on our results.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">We currently believe the efficiencies we can drive in our core businesses combined with certain other actions will be enough to fully offset the impact of these investments on our efficiency ratio in 2016. This would mean that our Citicorp efficiency ratio should remain relatively unchanged at around 57% this year, before improving in 2017 and thereafter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Turning to credit in Citicorp. We do expect credit costs to be higher in 2016 as loan loss reserve releases are largely behind us now. But the run rate for full year 2016 should be somewhat lower than we saw in the fourth quarter of 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">As I noted earlier, we believe Citi Holdings should be marginally profitable for the year and we expect our tax rate to remain in the range of around 30% to 31%. Finally, we expect our ROA to remain at 90 basis points or above.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">With that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p8\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hey, good morning, guys.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Good morning, Jim.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Maybe just a follow-up on credit. I think if you look at the last two quarters and then your guidance for the next two, it seems like you're adding, depending on what we assume for charge-offs $1.34 billion of reserves in the corporate book. It seems a little bigger than your peers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Generally we've talked about your exposures to larger multinationals that you wouldn't expect to see this kind of stress. So if you could just walk us through what you're seeing in your portfolio, where the stress is, maybe more specifics? That would be helpful.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yes, thanks, Jim. As you can imagine, most of the stress that we're seeing obviously is in the energy portion of the portfolio. And the guidance that I gave you as far as the roughly $600 million worth of cost of credit in the first half of the year, that's really based on a scenario where oil prices remain at the - at least current levels when I walked into this meeting, of around $30 a barrel and staying there for a sustained period.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Beyond that, as the portfolio is in excellent shape and mirrors the overall strategy that we have. But obviously, there is some pressure in the energy related markets at this point in time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Well can you help us with any sense of what you view as the worst case if we stay at $30 a barrel for 18 months, 2 years, with how much more it might be beyond that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Well I'm not going to go into scenario-by-scenario. The scenario I've given you is what our cost would be with oil at $30 for a sustained period. And think of sustained period as being something over a year, okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">If oil were to drop to say $25 a barrel and then stay there for a sustained period of time, then that first half cost of credit number that I gave you might double.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just one other question on the balance sheet. I think outside the asset sales it came down pretty nicely. Is that just the environment or do you think is that real progress in shrinking the balance sheet?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And we saw one of your competitors lower their surcharge. Any update on that or the ability to shrink your surcharge?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yes, we've been managing our balance sheet carefully for some time. You've seen our balance sheet gradually reduce. One is we've wound down holdings and then as we always adjust our balance sheet to the needs of our clients.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And as we continue to try to make the balance sheet more efficient and that's clearly been something that we have worked on for several years. You've seen us address the LCR ratio. We've got, I know others are talking about massive reductions this year in their non-operating deposits.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">We came into the year with less than $100 billion of non-operating deposits and we exit the year with less than $50 billion of non-operating deposits. So I can't reduce my balance sheet by hundreds of billions of dollars of non-operating deposits because they're not there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">As far as from a GSIB point of view, if you recall, I'm doing this a little bit from memory, in 2014, when the topic of GSIB first came out, our estimate was that we would actually be in the 4% bucket.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">However, the continued efforts that I just referenced to improve the efficiency of our balance sheet resulted in us actually appearing in the 3.5% bucket by last year end. And as you can see, we've continued to make progress in 2015 on improving the efficiency of the balance sheet and those efficiency efforts naturally also do have some impact on our key GSIB drivers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So I would now estimate that our score puts us very deep into the 3.5% bucket. And if you want some specifics, during 2015, we've reduced our OTC derivative notionals by 21%. We reduced our Level 3 assets by 21% and as I think I remember, we've reduced our short-term wholesale funding score by 19%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Now there's still elements of the calculation that are still being finalized such as our cross jurisdictional claims and liabilities. So I can't comment on the final surcharge calculation today. But clearly our continued efficiency efforts have had an impact.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. Great. That's very helpful. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Hi, thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Hi, Glenn.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I know this is a tough one, but I want to see how you think about it. With the benefit of hindsight obviously, we look back in '08 and saw the hidden leverage, now see the hidden leverage related to a decline in housing, and obviously there was a lot of products in CDL land and things that lead to the destruction that we saw. This is not the same. There are not products like that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">However, curious to see how you think about the potential hidden leverage or maybe the follow on impacts in other sectors of the lower oil prices. So while I think you're doing a conservative job the way you described it in reserving for specific energy credits, I'm curious on how you even begin to stress and think about it across the rest of the portfolio?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yes, fair question, Glenn. And it's something that we look at constantly and we're always doing that. One of the reasons, we haven't seen any real knock on effects as yet broadly across the rest of the portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">But frankly, if part of what I had commented on earlier, I mentioned that we had a $600 million reserve build, about half of that had to do with energy, and then of the other $300 million, roughly half of that is money that we've put away just for macro concerns.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Where we don't see specifics in portfolios, but we're trying to make sure that we've got something there because again, just as you, there may be knock on effects that appear later that just aren't there right now. And that's one of the reasons why we do things like put up macro reserves.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. I appreciate that. And then there were specific declines in one of the slides, it showed, you showed in your appendix the specific declines in consumer credit receivables in both Korea, Brazil and I guess Russia.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">But I'm just curious, are those specific actions you're taking to manage risk or is there pay down, charge off, just curious on those specific markets?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yes. Let's start with the last one that you mentioned. Russia, obviously as you know, Russia has been going through a bit of turmoil over the last several years probably at this point in time, at least 2 years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And we've been tightly managing our book there. We actually feel very good about the way the credit portfolio has performed in Russia over that period of time. Yes, we've had some elevated losses compared to what we would assume to have in normal times.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">But the portfolio in general has actually performed much better than we had originally modeled. And again, I think that's by and large a theme that you'll hear as I talk about every country and whether I'm talking about consumer or the ICG, is that overall, our very tightly focused customer strategy in each of our businesses gives us a credit portfolio that is quite resilient when it comes to times of trouble.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Doesn't mean that we're going to be completely immune from having to take some losses, but we think that it produces a very resilient book of business. So with Russia, it's a little bit of just - there's less business there. We are carefully managing credit lines and really nothing more than that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">With Brazil, there's certainly - that's another country that we look at very, very closely. And again, the reductions in Brazil, some of that comes out of a wind down of a commercial portfolio that we have in Brazil.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">You'll recall that I mentioned the up-tick in Latin America NCLs in the fourth quarter. The largest part of that up-tick is related to some losses that we took in the CCB, in our commercial business and that is really centralized in Brazil and it's this portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We're winding it down. Those NCLs were offset by reserve releases and again, we feel pretty good about the way the overall portfolio is operating in Brazil.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">John, if I can chime in and you think about, Glenn, the countries that you mentioned interestingly, they fall into some different buckets. So you've heard us on this call for quite a while talk about the restructuring in Korea. And I think you see the balance sheet in Korea reflect the tightening branch closures, tighter target market in Korea.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">In Russia's case there's a couple levers that naturally occur. One naturally occurs and the other come as an after of that. And so you've had a currency depreciation. So in dollar terms, your loans, your local currency loans tend to naturally shrink.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">But at the same time as those economies slow and you stay focused around your target client, your client acquisition, your asset acquisition, your lending, just tends to naturally slow as part of those economies and as you stay disciplined, that's what you would expect to see.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And in the case of Brazil, in some ways a combination of those, a restructuring of what's gone on there, John talked about the commercial portfolio. You've heard us talk historically about the sale of our Credicard business, which was the mass merchant card business which didn't fit, which in hindsight was a terrific sale, and just staying disciplined around those things. So I think its part of our natural credit and business process.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. Well I appreciate it. And I guess that the bottom line is you're still able to grow international consumer a couple of percent a year right now. So I guess stay disciplined. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Thanks. Good morning, guys.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Hey, Brennan.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So could you give some color, obviously there's a lot of investor concern over emerging market health, maybe given your unique position allows you to comment on it. Could you give some color on what you've seen as far as spending trends and credit trends in Asia and LatAm?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Obviously John, you already weighed out very clearly that the majority of the up-tick in the credit losses was the wind down in Brazil. So we need to half that roughly at least. But maybe some additional color and some spending color might be helpful too?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes, let me start. Again, when I mentioned earlier, I talked about Latin America specifically regarding CCB credit but we also saw a slight up-tick in Asia. You'll see that the up-tick got us from 79 bps to 84 bps. But it was there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And again, when you take a look at what's going on in the commercial portfolio certainly outside of Brazil, we've got some deterioration in SMEs. But most of that is in areas that are really tightly related to either commodity prices or perhaps some GDP concerns coming out of China.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So its - but we really haven't seen globally yet any clear patterns of consumers being stressed due to any of these weaknesses. Lower oil prices in particular are a benefit to customers on a broader scale probably than any impact on the SMEs. So we just don't see that there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Now obviously if the economies go south due to the fact that and driving higher unemployment, then we'll likely see some natural follow on in the consumer portfolios. But we don't see that today.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And as I had mentioned in response to Glenn's question, even if that were to happen, we still expect our consumer portfolios to be more resilient than the broader market given our focus on higher quality segments, and which we think is really the right strategy for us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So when you take a look at our EM consumer exposures around the world, we continue to feel good about the underlying credit quality overall. And again, that's driven by our target client strategy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">We took actions early on. Mike mentioned the sale of the Credicard portfolio in Brazil. We've exited other portfolios in other countries. We reshaped the portfolios in India, in Mexico, in Korea.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And there's a lot of good also regulatory controls that exist in Asia, that while it may dampen our revenue prospects from time-to-time, they actually form a pretty good basis then for a solid credit story.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And you think about Asia. Asia accounts for 70% of our total International Consumer portfolio and we've seen loss rates under 100 basis points in Asia for the past 4 years. And even as we've seen slowing economic growth and other pressures in the region, we're under 100 basis points.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And again, I hate to bore you, but that's a function of our target client strategy. Over 80% of our originations are to borrowers that would be comparable to 700 plus FICO scores in the US. And as I mentioned, we've tightened the client focus in Korea and India to really focus again on these higher quality segments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I mentioned about benefiting from some of the strict regulatory issues. Mortgage loan to value is probably a good example of that. Our mortgage portfolio in Asia, the mortgage outstandings have got an updated LTV of less than 50%. And our historical NCL rate on our Asia mortgage portfolio is close to zero.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So again, I feel pretty good overall about the consumer picture. And if you want to go in Latin America, Mexico is by far and away the largest market for us in that region. And even though we've got more mass market borrowers in Mexico, the credit story has really improved because we've again, tightened the focus to a much narrower client segment over the years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So again, pretty good. And spending patterns, you've seen the growth in purchase sales. It's still there. It's somewhat muted because of the overall economic environment, but it's still there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Great. Thanks for that, John. And then, switching over maybe to holdings. I know there's a lot of noise this quarter. But could you maybe set for us how we should think about now at this point from where we are, and I know it's a fluid situation because as you announced, you've still got several billion dollars of sales already inked here for 2016.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">But what's the right way to think about the revenue and expense rate jumping off point from here in holdings?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">You know, it's a great question and I'm sure it frustrates you as you try to come up with how you want to model holdings out into the future. And the truth is holdings is somewhat - it just doesn't lend itself to a good model.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">A lot of what goes through Holdings, as you can imagine, is episodic. There's just episodic numbers that hit whether we have a gain on sale. We move something into a held for sale.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">When you look at the cost of credit line in holdings this quarter and it looks extremely high. And it's like wow, how come you had such a high cost of credit in holdings?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Well, we moved a couple of large, about $8 billion of loans into held for sale. We expect that we'll be able to get rid of these loans somewhere in the first half of the year. But the way accounting works, the loss that I expect to take on that loan sale I have to run through my loan loss reserve.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So there was $160 million of loan loss reserve build that I had to have in holdings this quarter just because I took $8 billion of loans and moved them into held for sale.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So it's really tough. The best guidance I can give you, Brennan, is the guidance that I tried to give you during the call, which is think in terms of holdings being marginally profitable on an EBT point of view in each quarter next year. That's really what we're striving for.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Not a problem.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Hi, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Hey, Matt.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Can you talk about the outlook for DTA consumption and maybe some of the levers to pull if there's continued headwinds either related to OCI or just macro environment impacts to the actual earnings?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes, our look at holdings, if you take a look at DTA for the full year this year, consistent with what we've said, we got about $2.5 billion of DTA reduction out of our - out of our businesses. So our earnings consume $2.5 billion of the DTA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And when we take a look at our DTA planning for a given year, we're focused first and foremost on what are we going to get out of the core businesses. So that was pretty good I thought.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And then, I can't do much to control OCI. But don't forget what happens through OCI really impacts timing differences of DTA. And so that will, you know, especially when you think about the impact on our available for sale securities, those are losses that we need to take today that will largely accrete back to us over time. And so that's just merely a timing difference.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">The more critical elements for us in DTA are the foreign tax credits because those are items as we've said before that have got a time slot connected with them. There's an expiration date associated with that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And so we felt really good about our ability to utilize $2 billion of net foreign tax credits during 2015. Maybe the better story within that is I mentioned that we fully utilized the $1.9 billion of FTC that we had coming into the year that was going to expire in 2017.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">But we also utilized a $0.5 billion of the FTCs that are starting to - that would otherwise expire in 2018. So we've gotten a little bit of a head start on 2018 as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And that's really from a DTA planning point of view. That is our first and foremost most important objective, utilize FTCs and focus on utilizing FTCs that have a near term expiration date.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">The one thing that we never want to do is we never want to go into a year and have FTCs set to expire that year. So that's really how we think about DTA planning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. And then just separately, you mentioned about investing in high ROA businesses and obviously spent some time going through the US credit card effort. Are there other businesses that may not be as high in the pecking order or not represent as big of an investment that you had highlight?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I think there had been an article in one of the papers recently about the equities business. If that's one or if there's other areas that you had mentioned?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes. So Matt, you're right to call out equities. Equities is one of those places where we think we've got continued upside. We talked about wanting to get equities in that $800 million to $900 million per quarter range.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">We got real close to that. We think we've got more we can do and so we're investing in there and people and research, electronic trading platforms and other things you've probably seen and read about.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Obviously our Treasury and Trade Solutions business, we think continues to be an area where we can continue to take share around our target clients. We think some of the disruptions amongst the European banks and other things out there, given people may have more balance sheet constraints than we do, that we can use our balance sheet smartly around some investments in parts of that business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Our security services businesses, our private banks, private bank. A lot of the things where you've seen this year where we've had good growth but think there's more.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. And lastly if I can squeeze in, you've obviously made a lot of progress, huge progress de-risking. A lot of progress refining the portfolio of businesses. You probably wouldn't tell us which ones they would be.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">But is there another cut at looking at the geography, looking at the businesses, overlaying those and coming up with another handful of businesses or a handful of markets to reposition?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yes. We've consistently talked about, we've got a methodology that we've applied consistently to our businesses around our invest to grow, optimize and grow, stay the course or restructure mentalities that we've applied towards businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And what we've said is we need to see our businesses and our geographies on the right trajectory to be accretive to our company and to our shareholders. And we are constantly reviewing that and those buckets and businesses continue to evolve around capital and balance sheet efficiencies. And that's work I think in some ways that never ends.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So we've made progress. And as I said to our team, I'm pleased but not satisfied in terms of where we are and we've got more work to do.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Hi, good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">A couple quick questions. One is on the outlook for capital excess capital and capital return. I don't think we spoke too much yet about that. And with the OneMain sale, could you speak to how much RWA you're able to move off and to the degree that you can speak to how much excess capital you think it generates that you could potentially ask for in the upcoming CCAR?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Betsy, let me - this is John. Let me talk to OneMain and then Mike can talk to the capital distribution broadly. When you take a look at OneMain, we said it was about $9 billion worth of the GAAP assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">But it was actually part therefore of the GAAP asset reduction that you saw in holdings. And in the same fashion, it was part of the roughly 30 billion - $23 billion worth of reduction in RWA that we had in holdings this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So overall Holdings came down 23, risk-weighted assets in Citi Holdings came down $23 billion this quarter and OneMain was part of that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So when you look, we've made continued progress in driving down holdings. We've made continued progress on the rest of the balance sheet as well and all of that leaves us to the 12% CET1 ratio that we have at the end of this year. And Mike\u2026</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So Betsy, what we do know is we know our numbers, we know our ratios. You've seen our capital generating capacity net of approximately $6 billion capital return. We still generated 140 basis points of CE Tier 1 in the course of '15 and we think we continue to have significant capital generating power going forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So we feel like from where ratios are, we're coming into this year's exercise or this year's submission in a stronger place. We also know that we're going to be using - the industry is going to be using a Gen-4 balance sheet. We think that's for us a good balance sheet, but what we don't know is we don't know the scenarios.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And so we feel good about our drivers, but until we know the scenarios and how those impact us, it's tough to put any kind of number on that. But going back to what we've said before, we recognize our capital generating capacity and power and we've got to position the institution and affirm to continue to ramp up and more meaningfully be returning capital to our shareholders. Otherwise we're just going to be faced with a denominator problem.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay, I appreciate that. And then just one clean up question on energy. Did you give a ratio of your energy reserves to your energy exposure and if you could split it between oil and gas and metals and mining, wondering if you have that handy?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">One, Betsy, I didn't give that ratio and I don't really intend to give that ratio. But obviously, we've taken what we think are the appropriate reserving actions for it. Metals and mining is actually outside of energy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So metals and mining would not be specifically covered in any of the energy related comments that I gave. But consistent with the energy story, we've also taken a good look at the metals and mining.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Now don't forget, metals and mining we don't report that separately. Metals and mining is part of the larger sector that we report. But when you think about the metals and mining, our exposure overall to metals and mining is about $14 billion and that includes about $5.6 billion worth of funded loans.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And again, it's another portfolio that as you can imagine is run consistent with the overall strategy. So good investment grade rating. I think it's somewhere around over 70% in metals and mining. And there's nothing special to talk about from a reserving point of view in metals and mining this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Thank you. Good afternoon, guys.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Hi, Gerard.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Mike, can you share with us, obviously, you guys have a very strong capability of generating capital as you just explained. We don't know what the final capital ratios will be for our G-SIFIs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">But what buffer do you think you're comfortable with, maybe its 2 years from now. Again, we don't know what these final numbers will be. But how much are you going to carry in capital above whatever the final requirement is for you guys?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I think based on what we know today, we think a buffer is somewhere in the range of 50 to 100 basis points. That obviously could evolve over time, but I'd say based on what we know today, we think for a company with the construct of our balance sheet, risk profile, et cetera, that's probably the right range for now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. Thank you. And then, John, you mentioned in the Equities business, that you might be taking some market share from some of your competitors or potentials, particularly the European banks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I saw on your slide 33 in the appendix how your local markets rates and currencies, you are doing well there. Are there any banks that you're seeing that you are able to take market share from in Europe or Asia?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Well, it's Mike, Gerard. We're not going to get specific but obviously around a number of those banks that there is questions in terms of strategy going forward. Oftentimes in those banks what you'll see is the binding constraint around leverage, and rates and currencies very often is one of the areas where leverage for obvious reasons causes some of the tougher challenges and where I think we've seen people pulling back balance sheet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So again, around scale, around local presence, we've had the ability to take some of that share. And I think that the slide you call out on page 33 is a great illustration of one of our franchises that happens to sit in a trading business, but has tremendous stability to its revenue generating capacity and capabilities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Thank you. And then you mentioned I think you're going to close 50 branches right off here, a bunch of them up in Boston. Can you guys talk to us about the success you've had in other areas where you've just shut branches down? But you talked about or touched upon the mobile channel.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">How you're able to keep some of these customers because of mobile banking inroads that everybody is making. What kind of success are you seeing in keeping these customers where maybe you physically have left the market?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yes, I mean, again, and we've, as you know, exited a few markets across the country. And in general, we find that we're now able to retain slightly over 50% of the deposits from those customers even as we pull back on the branch banking in those areas.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">That's one of the reasons why we're trying to make an even bigger push into digital or mobile banking. We think that that's more responsive to the way people are really going to access their bank in the future.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And so, we think that that gives us a lot of opportunity and it's something that we're spending money trying to improve our capabilities there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Great. And then just finally, I know John, you talked about the pretax contribution that your actions in Citi Holdings had in the quarter, about a $1.3 billion. What was the actual gain on the sale of OneMain? I don't think I heard you say. I don't know if you're going to disclose it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">You've never heard me say it and we're not likely to disclose it. So it's in the results for holdings for the quarter. And again, we utilized a fair portion of that gain to buy back a high coupon debt that was supporting the rest of the holdings business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So again, to us it's not whether or not we made a big gain on that. It's overall what's the cost of exiting everything that we've got in holdings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. Thank you, I appreciate it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Not a problem.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Hi. I think I heard the positive comments about 2015. You had an ROA of 94 basis points, an ROTCE of 9.2%, efficiency of 57% and your tangible book is up to $61. I don't think anybody cares today and that leads to my question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">John, you mentioned you're not seeing a knock on effect from what's taking place in China and commodities. At least not enough to change your reserve guidance more than you've already done.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">But I just think it would be helpful to have some more data on the exposures in energy, in China and just perhaps Mike, a bigger picture perspective on what you think is taking place in the markets right now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Sure. John, do you want to start on China and we can talk a little bit about and I'd love to that point to call everybody's attention. I think the information we've got on the combination of slides 29 and 30, if you spend a little bit of time with it, is in some ways quite informative.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">We talked a bit about some of the consumer numbers earlier and the diversifications there and the mix between North America and International. I think it's interesting when you take that consumer exposure and you transition to page 30 and actually look at the balance, look at the balance of our portfolios, the lack of concentrations, the mix of loan composition.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And so, when we go to the EM exposure, I'd actually call your attention to the $113 billion of loans in the EM. We're actually over a third of those are in the Treasury and Trade Solutions space. So in the Treasury space, the very short term nature, they are largely to multinationals and the Trade Solutions space, they're largely collateralized.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So a little bit in my mind, Mike, like going back to when we went through all of the disclosure and GIPS [ph] $1 of loan can take on or $1 of exposure can take on very different meanings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And I think in our case, you really need to drill into these and see that of the $113 billion in EM, actually $49 billion is in corporate lending. And John has talked historically about the multinationals and what the credit quality of that books looks like.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">37% or $42 billion of that is in short term or collateralized space and $23 billion of that happens to be probably in the private banking related space. So don't think of those loans as being all the same and we take comfort from that. John, do you want to add to that before we go\u2026</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Again Mike, to close out on Mike's thought. When we take a look - the way that we run our business in the emerging markets is the same way that we run our business everywhere else around the world.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And it's focused on those large multinationals and some very top tier large local corporate\u2019s. And the overall portfolio has got - it's over 80% investment grade. So we do think it's a resilient portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">You mentioned China though, so let me - you mentioned China, let me try to build off of what Mike talked about a little bit in China. One of the things that we do Mike in our 10-Qs and 10-Ks is we lay out for you the top 20 emerging market countries as far as where we've got lending exposure. And we put that - it's on page 91 of our September 30 10-Q and we'll update that when we file our 10-K.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And if you take a look at page 91 of the 10-Q, it says that we've got $20.5 billion of aggregate exposure to China. And then we break it out for you as far as how that is between trading account assets and investment securities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And you'll see that as of September 30th, those two amounts totaled about $6.8 billion and those were largely dealing with sovereigns. So again, it's a pretty good book. And the sovereign securities in this quarter came down by about $1 billion. So you'll see that reflected when we update this page in the 10-K.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">When you then take a look at the consumer loan book, the consumer loan book is about $5 billion and I think that's pretty much what you'll see when we update it. But you heard me mention before about the high quality mortgage portfolio that we have throughout Asia.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Well, about half of that $5 billion is a high quality mortgage portfolio. Now the difference between what I gave you for Asia and China is that I mentioned that Asia in aggregate has an updated LTV of less than 50%. In China, the updated LTV is less than 40%. And again, it's underwritten to a high FICO equivalent, 700 plus.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">That leaves you with about $1 billion in credit cards and personal loans, same thing, very high FICO equivalent in excess of 700, and very good loss performance. Then we've got about $1 billion of commercial loans in China and we have been reducing the commercial exposures to China year-over-year as we've seen the economy slow. But again, even here this portfolio has been broadly stable.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So that leaves me with the last category that we give you which is the ICG loans of $8.8 billion. And the corporate book was flat to last quarter as well. And as we said in the past, more than half of that portfolio, as Mike talked about, the way it works around the world, it works the same way in China, more than half of that portfolio is either TTS loans which are generally short term secured financings or they are in the private bank.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So that leaves about $4 billion in what you would consider to be a traditional corporate lending book and over 90% of that corporate loan book in China is to either subsidiaries of large multinationals domiciled outside of China or to large state owned Chinese companies.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So as you would expect with a portfolio of that nature and consistent with our overall ICG strategy, the vast majority of this portfolio is also investment grade.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Well that's helpful. Can we move to energy though? I don't want you being the only bank not disclosing reserves to energy, oil and gas loans. I mean, I think most others have disclosed that who have reported so far.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And I mean, your stocks down 7%, the whole market is down a whole lot. But even if it's a low number it can't hurt too much more from here. So how much in oil and gas loans do you have and what are the reserves taken against that? I know you were asked this already but I'm going back for a second try?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">When you take a look at the overall portfolio Mike, we've reduced the amount of exposure. Our funded exposure to energy related companies this quarter is down 4%. It's about $20.5 billion. The overall exposure also came down about 4%. The overall exposure now is about $58 billion and that includes unfunded.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">When you take a look at the composition of the funded portfolio, about 68% of that portfolio would be investment grade. That's up from the 65% that we would have had at the end of the third quarter. And the unfunded book is about 87% investment grade.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">So while we are taking what we believe to be the appropriate reserves for that, but I'm just not prepared to give you a specific number right now as far as the amount of reserves that we have on that particular book of business. It's just not something that we've traditionally done in the past.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Well, if I can just test your conviction. You gave guidance of $600 million in loan loss provisions for ICG for the first half of the year, and so that would be half the run rate from the fourth quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">So something - I guess you're feeling pretty positive contrast to the market about those expectations, unless if oil goes to $20 as you said before. What's your level of confidence in that guidance?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">That level - I feel very confident at that level of guidance with oil at $30 a barrel. And I feel very confident about the additional guidance that I gave you should oil fall to $25 a barrel.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And then last follow up and maybe this is back to you, Mike. One theory that was put out there is that we are in a vicious cycle of liquidity, not due to Citigroup, not due to the banks. But you have a lot of bought investors that have been burnt, whether it's junk bond or private equity or liquidity funds.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And to the extent that liquidity dries up, you could have pressure on some of your borrowers even though it's not due to you. Do you think we are in a vicious cycle of liquidity or are you seeing any evidence of that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I think Mike, that liquidity today I would break into strata by credit segments. And I think you've seen that the bond markets throughout this, big financing done the other day, almost record setting financing in the investment grade space. So I think around investment grade credits the market's open. It will have its ups and downs but those windows will continue to largely stay open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I think as you go down the credit spectrum and on the back of Fed, on the back of uncertainties and unevenness in the world, I think you're going to see lower segments of the credit spectrum continuing to be challenged. And that will certainly be challenged in various forms of liquidity and most notably, illiquidity in some of those instruments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">All right. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ken Usdin</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Hi, good afternoon. Just one question, John, I believe you were talking about the still seeing that ability to grow Corp revenues this year. And I'm presuming you're talking constant dollar basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">So I was just wondering, obviously, a lot of uncertainties that we can caveat. But as it stands now, how much do you expect rates to inform that growth and how would you break the growth potential between NII and the fee side?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Well let me try to answer that in a couple different ways. One, again we're talking about low single digits and that's somewhat consistent with what we have here. There's not a heavy rate component in that guidance of 3% revenue growth.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">So we've had about, we certainly have had the first 25 basis point increase and that's good and we're counting on that and that's performing pretty much the way that we would have expected as far as the impact on our businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">We've got a modest level of rate increases built into the tail end of the year, maybe a rate increase somewhere towards the middle of the year and one right at the very end of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">So again, there's not a heavy increase in rate element of that low single digit number, equivalent to effect the - we had 3% this year, we'll see what low single-digits will look like next year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ken Usdin</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay. And then one question on balance sheet size, still things coming out of averages after the sales this quarter, the pending sales going forward. Do you have some type of view on where average earning assets balances out, where the kind of settle out point is after you've worked through the last part or the lingering parts of what you're planning on getting rid of?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">You mean for the overall - for holdings or the overall firm, I just\u2026</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ken Usdin</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I was thinking more overall firm because I'd presume that holdings kind of just dwindles back to the point where at some point you put it back into the overall firm. But I'm thinking more just big picture top of the house?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Yes, from a top of the house, I think what you've seen is that we adjust the size of our balance sheet based upon the opportunity that we see, and more importantly, the needs that our clients have. And so neither Mike or I have ever put an absolute cap that says we will not grow the balance sheet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Where we see that our clients have needs and we can provide solutions, we're more than happy to put our balance sheet at work. It's one of the advantages that we have given the capital level that we have and more importantly, given the supplemental leverage ratio that we have, and given the LCR that we are currently running at, which is at 112%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">So we do think that we've got a lot of capacity to put to work if and when we get faced with client need.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ken Usdin</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Right, okay. So we'll see a little bit of push up but you're not necessarily seeing a major shrinkage and you'd give yourself room for it to grow again, you're not capped out?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">No, but what you will consider, continue to see us do is try to make our balance sheet ever more efficient. And that means running off the low ROA assets and trying to gather more of the high ROA assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">That's the exact theory behind and the plan behind the investments that we're currently making in the US branded cards book.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ken Usdin</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Understood. Thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. John, a question for you on the Asia regional consumer and sort of your outlook there for operating leverage improvement. It looks like on a year-over-year basis you were able to generate some operating leverage with revenues down a little bit less than costs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">But I guess, I'm curious, given your comments about continued challenges on the regulatory front and the potential for slowdown in many of those economies, what's your thinking about potential operating leverage within the Asia consumer business in 2016?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Yes. I'd prefer, I mean, Asia and Latin America are going to be interesting next year and from a revenue perspective they both kind of have the same story which is more of revenue stabilizing in the first half of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And then as volumes grow during the balance of the year, we'll begin to see then a sequential growth in revenue, which will get us then to year-over-year revenue growth in the latter part of 2016.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And when I think about the expense story, again, I'm trying to manage, we're trying to manage the two together. And so from an international, overall international consumer point of view, I'd expect as we continue to make investments in selected growth investments, whether its technology or I mentioned digital and infrastructure, I'd say that we're going to pace the revenues against the revenue growth. And for the international GCB overall, we would look to return then to positive operating leverage in the latter half of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay. So it sounds like that guidance really hasn't changed very much?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">No.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Okay. And then just back stateside, given your strong capital levels and where you sit relative to your minimum requirements. I guess, I'm just curious if you're thinking even more aggressively about potentially using some of that capital to focus on non-organic growth in some of your US businesses as a way of accelerating use of the DTA?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">You know Matt, what we've said there is that we don't and will not look at transactions and rationalize the transaction or a purchase around DTA utilization. DTA utilization is the benefit that comes out of good transactions and that was the case in Best Buy, we believe that's the case in Costco.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">And we're wide open as John said we've got the resource balance sheet capital capability around things that are accretive to our firm to step into large situations and we're open to that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Unfortunately in this environment there's not a lot of those out there, but we'll continue to look. And again, staying true to our strategy, staying true to our target client base, if those opportunities present themselves, we'll try and take advantage of it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Okay. Fair enough. And finally, an administrative question. John, you'd mentioned in the past when holdings was a much bigger portion of the overall balance sheet that maybe at around 5% of assets you would think about folding holdings back into at least the reporting of the company. How are you thinking about that now that you're at about 4%?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Yes, and actually we've had conversations like that. The question always becomes where would we put it? And I don't want to take the assets that are in holdings and simply put them back into the businesses quote, from whence they came. Otherwise we would spend the entire call with you explaining how much of anything that happened was related to legacy assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">The alternate construct would be just to take and put it all into Corp/Other, but I almost get to the same point where I'd think then you'd all want to have more detail as far as what is in Corp/Other related to those legacy assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">So it's still something that Mike and I talk about all the time and at some point we will likely collapse it into say Corporate/Other. But it's probably still just a little bit too big to put into Corporate/Other just to avoid basically splitting it all out again just so that you guys will have a clearer picture of it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">So it's a bit annoying to have it out there as something separate, but we're not ready to combine it yet with Corp/Other.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Not a problem.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Yes, thanks. A quick question on the Costco. Was it right that you said it was expecting, the portfolio acquisition was expected to close late in the second quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Yes, we said later in the second quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Okay, is there any risk though that since it's an April 1 cutoff for the contract that you've started the contract without actually acquiring the portfolio? And why did it get pushed back past the contract date?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">No, as you can imagine, we're involved in a rather intense discussion with both the current owner of the portfolio as well as Costco. And as we have gone down trying to figure out what is the best way to affect the handover.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">What we determined in running down this process is that a date where we can get a concurrent closing of the portfolio as well as then a conversion of all of the operations is probably the simplest and most efficient solution for everybody. And it's probably the best way to ensure a seamless customer experience as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">So then as we looked at various dates, something in June just seemed to work best as far as a date that we could point to when we could not only transfer the portfolio, but then also make sure that there's a nice clean hand off of all the operational aspects of the portfolio as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Okay. And then just a second question. I know you laid out the macro conditions and how they are deteriorating somewhat across the globe, but I mean, doesn't that argue for a period of belt tightening as opposed to renewed investment?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">I know there's attractive opportunities you're saying, but I mean, isn't there other places that should be cutting as well at the same time on expenses?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Well, as you look around the globe, we're forecasting somewhere, depending how you build China into the forecast, somewhere GDP growth, somewhere between 2.5 and 2.8. 2% out of developed markets, 4% out of developing markets. And if you look at the US, the US has a candidly, a pretty good feel to it. And so, I wouldn't argue to belt tightening there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">If we look at what's going on in Europe and we talked about what we see, not just some of the absolute, but some of the relative opportunities there, that feels pretty good. And then you start to look at pieces and parts of the rest of the franchise. A lot of these franchises on the ground are TTS franchises and different parts and pieces there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">So we're going to continue to be very mindful. You've seen us, we talked about the overall headcount reduction which is net of significant investment into controls and we're going to continue to be mindful and to make sure that we are scaling and sizing our company to what we think the opportunities are.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">And I think that we've shown we haven't been afraid at the right times to make the investments and we haven't been afraid at the tougher times to pull things back, and I think that will be the case in '16.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">And don't forget, I mean, with the investments that we're planning, our guidance is that we intend to hold the operating efficiency ratio constant with this year. So therefore, our goal is to fund those investments through additional operational efficiencies.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">As I mentioned, we're constantly looking to make the place more efficient and adjust the capacity level. So all of that will continue and all we're saying is that we're going to use those savings to fund these investment programs which we think are beneficial for the future.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Okay. Great. Thanks for taking my questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Erika Najarian</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Yes, hi. I just wanted to slip one quick question in as a follow-up to Betsy's question on CCAR. Mike, we appreciate that you're coming into this year's CCAR with strong ratios and of course, we don't have the parameters yet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">You've always talked about the progress on the qualitative side as just that, progress. And I'm wondering if you're satisfied enough with your progress in terms of your qualitative report card to feel confident about a step up in ASK [ph] this year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Again, I think the ASK, there's a couple components there because you layout to the ASK. And one is what do your numbers tell you and second is, how do you feel from your process? We have continued [Technical Difficulty]really ever gets to an end state, we'll see.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">But I feel better today than I felt a year ago given our investments about where we are qualitatively and I hope I feel better a year from today than I feel today around that. So long winded answer of saying feel better about where we are qualitatively, but more work to do.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Erika Najarian</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Great. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Good afternoon.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Hi, Steven.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">So I have actually a follow-up to Erica's question. Just thinking about the upcoming CCAR submission, recognizing it's still early days. But within the submission itself, Mike, you mentioned that you like how the fourth quarter balance sheet looks, but does Costco and the additional receivables have to be contemplated as part of your submission?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Steven, we'll assume in CCAR that we go ahead with the Costco acquisition. We think that that is responsive to the rules as they currently exist. But again, the acquisition date will be somewhat later in June.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">And so we'll have to see what stress tests look like as far as what the condition of the portfolio would be in when we acquire it in June.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Understood. And just switching over to the risk-weighted asset size within capital. I appreciate a lot of the guidance that you've given in terms of the holdings trajectory and the reduction that we're expecting on the coming year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">But it appears as though that benefit is now going to be exhausted or largely exhausted in terms of RWA shrinkage and yet you're going to be continuing to grow Citicorp on a core basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">And just want to get a sense as to how we should be thinking about the RWA trajectory for 2016 given all of those moving parts?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Yes, we rarely give guidance on the RWA. But again, there is several things that would go on there. One, as you mentioned, we will continue to wind down holdings and we will continue to get some benefit there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Currently, we would look to see that, that should more or less give us some ability then to manage growth in the rest of Citicorp with the exception of course of the addition of the Costco portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">But then you've got on the other hand, we continually, as I said before, looking to make sure that we're running even a more risk efficient balance sheet. So I think you might see some increase in RWA coming into 2016, but I wouldn't guide you to some huge amount of growth.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Understood. And just given the market risk proposal that came out and recognizing you've only had a mere 24 hours to digest the release from BASEL. But do you have any preliminary expectations or takeaways from what came out yesterday, and what's a reasonable expectation for even a range of potential market risk inflation?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">My initial impression, not that I have gone through the whole thing, but from people that I've spoken to here that actually have begun to go through it, is that they still need to do a lot more work. And so we will continue to try to pass appropriate commentary on to the right parties to see that that work is done.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">But if you take a look don't forget, our risk-weighted assets coming out of market risk currently are $77 billion. It's roughly 6% of the total RWA. So while this proposal could have a significant impact on our market risk RWA, you've got to gauge it in the fact that we're talking about 6% of our total RWA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Got it. And then just one ticky tack question on the NIM guidance. John, you mentioned that any rate benefit, which sounds like it'll be relatively modest that's contemplated within the guidance for '16, is going to be offset by a reduction in trading NII.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">I just wanted to get a sense as to what's driving that? Is it a function of lower inventory levels, issuance tied to TLAC or is it something else?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">No, trading NIM is something that is largely variable, and only because you - the composition of your portfolios change constantly. And so this year, I would just say that we've had a larger than expected contribution to NIM coming off the trading book than we would have experienced in years past. And I haven't gotten yet to the point where I'm comfortable saying that that's the new norm.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">And so, if trading NIM reverts back closer to where it was in the past, then it could offset some of the - all or some of the benefit that we expect to get out of rates. But you know, I'll certainly have more to talk to you about as we get further into '16 and we see whether or not we've actually got the trading NIM really working consistently at this point in time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Thanks for clarifying that, John. And appreciate you taking my questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Not a problem.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Hey, Eric.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Hi, how are you? Mike, I just want to bring together some of your comments to make sure I understand sort of the strategic imperatives as it comes to a lot of the repositioning that's occurred.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">So on the four quadrant slide that you first introduced that seems to still describe your approach. Is the bar getting higher for the businesses that are in the upper left hand quadrant or is that more or less a static standard?</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">I would say at the time we introduced that, we also - at the time we introduced that firm wide was also coincided with it at the point in time we put our targets in place. So I would say that those have largely been the same or consistent over the 3 years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Clearly, leverage has been introduced, supplemental leverage has been introduced since then. There's been the evolution of CCAR and CCAR returns. And so today, I would say that actually we're looking at it in some ways consistently, but in other ways with the additional view of some of the lenses I just mentioned.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Okay. And is anything that's going on in the broader macro economy causing some business lines or geographies to fall out of that segment and into the lower right segment?</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">No, I would say not right now. You'll get some things that have some aberration. So an example I would give you is we have in parts of our cards portfolio, we've got gasoline cards.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">So simply spend on gasoline cards have come down by a third when volumes are the same. And so you're not necessarily going to take a short-term view and say that gee, gas cards is a bad business. It may not be what we wanted at this point of the cycle or at this inflection point in oil prices.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">But again, in here, we're not taking short-term views around these. So I would say at this point not.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Okay. And John, one quick balance sheet question. You talked about the debt buyback as a consequence of the OneMain sale and the fact that you have so little non-operational deposits left.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">At this stage, is there any real balance sheet optimization opportunity left to you or have those been largely exhausted?</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Well, I'd say there's always some opportunity. I mean, obviously, we've taken a good chunk of the opportunity so far and become more and more efficient. But there's still ways of optimizing the balance sheet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">So not necessarily making it more efficient by making it smaller, but there's still elements of balance sheet optimization such as shifting more of the balance sheet towards those higher ROA businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">So I'd say that maybe the word going forward will be optimization rather than making it more efficient. But in anyway it's still targeting our focus on improving the overall ROA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Got it. Excellent. Thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Thank you.

Today\u2019s call will be hosted by Susan Kendall, Head of Citi Investor Relations.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Kendall, you may begin.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Susan Kendall</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you, Brent. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Mike Corbat, will speak first then John Gerspach, our CFO will take you through the earnings presentation which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we\u2019ll be happy to take any questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation may contain forward-looking statements which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results and capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including without limitation the Risk Factors section of our 2015 Form 10-K.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you, Susan. Good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported earnings of $3.5 billion for the first quarter of 2016 or $1.10 per share. These results reflect a difficult macro environment, which was more challenging than we anticipated when we entered the year. That said, we continue to make progress in key areas. We grew loans and deposits in our core businesses, utilized different tax assets, generated and returned capital to our shareholders and reduced our expenses while absorbing a significant repositioning charge.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">In our institutional businesses, market sensitive products clearly suffered from weak investor sentiment during the quarter. This primarily impacted our trading and investment banking revenues. However, our accrual and transaction service businesses posted 7% year-on-year growth, consistent with recent quarters. These businesses are gaining market share and now contribute almost half of our institutional revenues.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Investor sentiment was also impacted our consumer business including wealth management and especially in Asia. And while U.S. branded cards showed stronger performance across key indicators, both top and bottom-line results remained lower due to the investments we are making in that business. Overall, credit trends remained very stable in our consumer portfolios as we continued to focus on our targeted segments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Our global consumer bank is now entirely focused on our priority markets of the U.S., Mexico and Asia, and we see real path for growing our franchise. We\u2019ve been optimizing our footprint in terms of countries and branches to make sure we are allocating our resources to areas where they can generate the best returns.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In the last three years, we have exited or are in the process of exiting from 19 consumer markets. And in February, we announced we would sell our consumer businesses in Brazil, Argentina and Colombia and focus solely on our growing institutional business in South America. During the quarter, we also reduced our branch footprint by 82 while increasing our average deposits in our nearly 2,700 branches globally.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We also took a repositioning charge in the quarter. Repositioning is part of our effort to make share Citi is appropriately sized and structured for the current environment. We have identified opportunities for greater efficiencies in our regional models including additional delayering and shifting staff to our service centers which now host more than half of our people. That will drive an additional reduction of headcount which was down 3% during the quarter to 225,000, almost 40,000 fewer than when I became CEO.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We also drove another significant reduction of assets in Citi Holdings, which were down 10% from the end of last year and down 44% from one year ago. For the seventh quarter in a row, Holdings was profitable. And while our work isn\u2019t done with Holdings assets now accounting for just 4% of our balance sheet, we won\u2019t report Holdings results -- we won\u2019t report Holdings separately after this year. And being able to do, this is a testament to the excellent work of the Holdings team, which we expect to remain intact and continue to unwind the remaining assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">The wind down of Citi Holdings is a significant milestone for our institution and it\u2019s been a long time goal. We said, we take Citi Holdings to a point where its assets weren\u2019t meaningful enough to merit separate reporting and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. Another area we\u2019ve focused on is shrinking our deferred tax assets. In the first quarter, we utilized an additional $1.6 billion in DTAs, which contributed to a net increase of $6 billion in regulatory capital and our CET1 ratio increasing to 12.3%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We continue to return capital to our shareholders, repurchasing 31 million in common shares during the quarter, bringing the net reduction of outstanding shares to just under a 100 million over the last four quarters. Our tangible book value per share increased almost $2 to $62.58 in the quarter. We continue to make progress in our efforts to be a safer and stronger institution. And earlier this week, we learned that neither the Fed nor the FDIC found any deficiencies in our 2015 resolution plan.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">And last week, we submitted our capital plan to the Federal Reserve. We believe that the combination of an even stronger capital position and the improvements we\u2019ve made in our capital planning process as well as in our risk management, compliance and control functions have allowed us to make a strong submission.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">While 2016 didn\u2019t get off to the start we\u2019d hoped for, the environment stabilized in the second half of the quarter. Volatility decreased as some of the more pessimistic scenarios failed to materialize. However, the outlook is still right with risks from political elections to interest rates. I think as we\u2019ve shown in this quarter, we can manage through challenging times. We think we have -- where we have too much capacity, we\u2019ll reduce it, while still serving our clients. We think certain sectors are showing science of weakness, we\u2019ll manage our exposures even more tightly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">John will now go through the presentation and then we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. John?</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Thank you, Mike and good morning everyone. Starting on Slide 3, we highlight the impact of CVA/DVA on our prior period results. Beginning this quarter, we adopted Fed B\u2019s new accounting standard on the reporting of DVA or debt valuation adjustments. Under the new rule, changes in DVA that relate to Citi\u2019s own credit spreads are no longer recognized in earnings, but instead are reflected in OCI. So, we longer need to adjust our reported revenues in net income to exclude this item. Going forward therefore, we will speak to reported results in our earnings presentation, which should be largely comparable to the historical results excluding CVA/DVA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On Slide 4, we show total Citigroup results. In the first quarter, we earned $3.5 billion. Revenues of $17.6 billion declined 11% from last year, mostly driven by lower industry-wide activity in markets and investment banking, a continued wind down of Citi Holdings and the impact of FX translation. In constant dollars, revenues were down 9% including a 6% decline in our core Citicorp businesses. Expenses decreased 3% year-over-year, driven by the wind down of Citi Holdings, lower legal expenses and the benefit from FX translation, partially offset by higher repositioning costs and ongoing investments in the franchise. And net credit losses continued to improve offset by a loan loss reserve build this quarter compared to a net release in the prior year. In constant dollars, Citigroup end of period loans grew 1% year-over-year to $619 billion, as 5% growth in Citicorp was partially offset by the continued wind down of Citi Holdings and deposits grew 5% to $935 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On Slide 5, we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Citicorp revenues of $16.1 billion were down 9% from last year on a reported basis. In constant dollars, as I mentioned, revenues were down 6% from last year, mostly driven by capital markets related businesses, fixed income, equities, investment banking and Asia Wealth Management as well as the impact of our continued investments in U.S. branded cards.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Citicorp expenses increased 2%, reflecting the higher repositioning charges and ongoing investments in our franchise, partially offset by efficiency savings and the benefit from FX translation. And cost and credit grew 29% from the first quarter of last year, almost entirely driven by the energy sector. Otherwise, credit quality remained favorable. In ICG, we saw very little net cost of credit outside of energy this quarter. And in consumer, our NCL and rates, both continued to improve, although we are not benefiting from reserve releases as we had in the prior year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Citi Holdings contributed pretax earnings of $477 million this quarter, mostly driven by gains on asset sales. For the remainder of the year, we expect Citi Holdings to be closer to breakeven. We reduced Citi Holdings assets by $8 billion this quarter and in the period with $73 billion of assets or just 4% of total Citigroup with signed agreements in place to sell $10 billion of this remaining amount. And as Mike noted earlier, 2016 is the last year we\u2019ll report Citi Holdings as a separate segment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning now to each business, on Slide 6, we show results for international consumer banking in constant dollars. In total, international consumer banking revenues decline 2% year-over-year. And Latin America consumer, which is now comprised solely of our Mexico franchise, revenues grew 2% as growth in retail banking continued to be partially offset by pressure in cards. We saw good momentum in retail banking drivers, including 11% growth in average deposits and 9% growth in average retail loans. However, card balances remained under pressure in Mexico, as continued growth in purchase sales was offset by higher payment rates, reflecting our focus on higher credit quality segments of the market.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to Asia, consumer revenues decline 4% year-over-year, driven by weak investment sales revenues, as well as continued but abating regulatory pressures in cards. Outside of wealth management, retail banking revenues continued to grow year-over-year. And in card, we believe we are through the most significant regulatory headwinds, which I\u2019ll discuss more in a moment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In total, average international loans grew 1% from last year. Card purchase sales grew 4% and average deposits grew 5%. Operating expenses grew 4%, driven by higher repositioning charges and an increase in technology investments, primarily in Mexico, while core expenses in Asia were roughly flat. And finally, total international consumer credit costs increased 7% from last year, reflecting the impact of reserve releases in the prior period. Net credit losses declined and the NCL rates improved to 1.6%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On Slide 7, we show Asia consumer in more detail. The first quarter is historically a strong period for wealth management in Asia with higher transaction activity driving strong investment sales revenues. Given weak investor sentiment during the quarter, we didn\u2019t see the typical rebound in transaction activity and therefore our wealth management revenue declined significantly from last year. However, we have seen consistent net inflows in our assets under management, as you can see on the slide with the declining year-over-year trend in AUMs, driven by the impact of lower equity market values. Therefore, we remain well-positioned to serve these clients as market confidence improves in the future.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to cards, card purchase sales have slowed in the current environment but payment rates have stabilized and as a result our average card loans have continued to grow. As we begin to cycle past the most significant regulatory headwinds, this loan growth is starting to have a positive impact on revenue. So, while card revenue still declined year-over-year, the trends continue to improve and we believe we\u2019re on a path to achieve revenue growth in cards by the second half of the year. And credit trends remain favorable across the entire consumer business in Asia.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Slide 8 shows the results for North America consumer banking. Total revenues declined 4% year-over-year. Retail banking revenues of $1.3 billion were roughly flat, excluding a $110 million gain on the sale of our Texas branches last year as continued growth in loans in deposit spreads was offset by lower mortgage gain on sale revenues. In branded cards, revenues of $1.9 billion were down 6% from last year, driven by higher acquisition and rewards costs as we have continued to ramp up new account acquisitions in our core products. I\u2019ll talk more about branded cards in a moment. So, we continue to feel good about the investments we are making. And in fact, we saw a year-over-year growth in our average loans this quarter for the first time since 2008.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">And turning to retail services, revenues of $1.7 billion increased 3% from last year, mostly reflecting gains on the sale of two small portfolios. Even including the impact of these asset sales, average loans were flat year-over-year and purchase sales increased 2%. Total expenses of $2.5 billion in North America increased 7%, driven by higher repositioning costs and marketing investments, partially offset by efficiency savings as we continue to capture scale benefits in cards and rationalize our branch footprint. As previously announced, we exited over 50 branches this quarter, as we continue to concentrate on our key markets and adapt to a significant shift in customer behavior to digital channels.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">And finally, credit costs in North America increased 17% from last year, driven by a reserve build of approximately $80 million this quarter in our commercial portfolio related to energy credits. Our energy exposure in the commercial business is significantly smaller than the corporate portfolio we report in the ICG. On a global basis, we have energy exposure of $2.1 billion in the commercial business with $1.4 billion funded, 90% of which is in North America. The credits are mostly in the E&amp;P and services and drilling segments and are predominantly non-investment grade. We have no exposure in the commercial portfolio to junior or second lien positions and our funded reserve ratio is roughly 9%. We provide more details on this portfolio in the appendix to our earnings presentation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On Slide 9, we show some key performance indicators for North America branded cards including year-over-year growth in average active accounts, average card loans, and purchase sales for our total portfolio. In the second half of last year, we began to ramp up new account acquisitions in our core products and these investments are beginning to have a significant impact. Growth in average active accounts and purchase sales began to accelerate late last year and these trends are now driving total loan growth as well even as our legacy portfolios continue to shrink. Card revenues were still down year-over-year this quarter but we believe we can return to growth sometime in the latter part of 2016, not including the benefit of acquiring the cost Costco portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Slide 10 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail. Credit remained broadly favorable again this quarter with stable to improving NCL and delinquency rates in every region.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So, as we look at our consumer franchise globally, there are few things to highlight on Slide 11. First is the impact of the current environment on market sensitive businesses including wealth management as well as mortgage, which together drove a year-over-year decline in revenues of nearly $150 million. Second is our continued investment in U.S. cards, which is putting pressure on revenues today, but is also starting to drive real underlying performance improvement. And third is the impact of regulatory changes in our business particularly in Asia, which we believe is abating. When you pull back these drivers, you can see we are achieving growth, although muted, driven by overall growth in personal loans, card volumes and deposits. And we\u2019ve achieved this growth with very little change in our core expenses, in fact year-over-year the entire increase in our consumer operating expenses was driven by the combination of investments and higher repositioning costs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">As we move forward, we believe, we are making the right investments to grow the higher return markets and products in our franchise and that as these investments mature and we cycle past the remaining regulatory headwinds, we will be well positioned to drive higher returns to something in the range of 20% RoTCE in a more normal rate environment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Turning now to the intuitional clients group on Slide 12, revenues of $8 billion in the first quarter declined 12% from last year, driven by market sensitive businesses, fixed income, equities, and investment banking, total banking revenues of $4 billion excluding the impact of loan hedges declined 6%. Treasury and trade solutions revenues of $2 billion grew 8% last year in constant dollars, driven by continued growth in transaction volumes with new and existing clients as well as improved deposit spreads.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Investment banking revenues of $875 million were down 27% from last year, driven by an industry-wide slowdown in activity levels as well as our strong performance in M&amp;A the prior year. Private bank revenues of $746 million grew 5% year-over-year, driven by higher loan and deposit balances. And corporate lending revenues of $455 million were down 4% on a reported basis. In constant dollars, lending revenue declined 2% from last year as higher volumes were more than offset by the impact of positive fair value marks in the prior period.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Total market and security services revenues of $4.1 billion declined 15% from last year. Fixed income revenues of $3.1 billion were down 11% from last year. Rates in currencies grew 5% year-over-year with particular strength in March as market conditions improved versus the start of the year. However, this growth was more than offset by lower activity levels and a less favorable environment in both securitized products and commodities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Equities revenues declined 19%, reflecting the impact of lower volumes in cash equities as well as weaker performance in derivatives. In security services, revenues grew 3%, reflecting a modest gain on the sale of our private equity fund services businesses. And other included a charge of approximately $180 million, reflecting the write-down of virtually all of our investments in Venezuela as a result of changes in the exchange rate. Total operating expenses of $4.9 billion were up 5% year-over-year, driven by higher legal and repositioning costs. Core expenses were down 1% as higher regulatory in compliance costs and investments were more than offset by lower compensation expense and the impact of FX translation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On a trailing 12-month basis, excluding the impact of severance, our comp ratio remained at 27%. Total credit costs of $390 million were down from the fourth quarter but up significantly from last year. Nearly all of the ICG credit costs this quarter were related to energy. We built roughly $260 million of additional reserves and recognized losses of roughly $150 million in the energy sector. The reserve builds were concentrated in the E&amp;P and services and drilling segments driven by ratings migration due to sustained low oil prices as well as the impact of regulatory guidance. At quarter end, our total energy exposure in ICG was $57 billion of which approximately $22 billion was funded. The funded reserve ratio was 4.2% including a funded reserve ratio of over 10% on the non-investment grade portion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We have very little second lien exposure in the corporate portfolio with $85 million of total exposure and reserves against roughly a third of this amount. We provide more details on the corporate portfolio as well as the nature of our unfunded exposures in the appendix to our earnings presentation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">As we look at the potential for additional energy and non-energy provisions for the rest of 2016, if oil prices were in the range of around $30 per barrel, we now estimate our full-year ICG cost of credit would be roughly $1.4 billion. This is higher than our previous estimate of roughly $1 billion with about two-thirds of the increase related to the potential impact of regulatory guidance and the remainder reflecting our revised view on the portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">If you look across both the commercial and corporate portfolios, our total exposure to reserve based lending in North America is roughly $4 billion of which $2 billion is funded and we have a 9% funded reserve ratio against these loans. We estimate that our total RBL exposure could be reduced by roughly $500 million as a result of the upcoming spring redeterminations, and year-to-date, we have seen no material draw downs against these facilities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Turning back to ICG, we saw a significant increase in corporate non-accrual loans this quarter, up by $730 million sequentially with roughly $500 million related to energy and $90 million related to metals and mining. Our total metals and mining exposure was $13 billion at the end of the first quarter with roughly $5 billion funded, and we did not incur any cost of credit on the portfolio in the first quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">The increase in non-accrual loans in metals and mining as well as other sectors outside of energy did not result in a material cost of credit as we have significant collateral against many of the loans. Nearly two-thirds of both the total additions as well as the energy-related additions to non-accrual loans this quarter remain performing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On Slide 13, we show the year-over-year EBT walks for ICG, highlighting several themes. First, despite the challenging market conditions this quarter, we continued to see growth in several of our accrual and transaction services businesses including treasury and trades solutions, private banks, and security services.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">The market environment had a biggest impact on fixed income, equities, and investment banking, which together were down 16% year-over-year. To offset these pressures, we continue to actively address our structure, reducing capacity in areas where revenues are likely to remain muted, while preserving our client facing capabilities, and these actions drove much of the repositioning charge in ICG this quarter. The remaining EBT drivers were the write-down of our investments in Venezuela, mark-to-market losses on low hedges driven by spread movements and of course the higher credit cost in energy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Turning to the next slide, as I noted, we saw continued growth this quarter in many of our ICG businesses. Together, TTS, corporate lending, private bank and security services account for nearly half of total ICG revenues and they grew 7% year-over-year this quarter in constant dollars. This growth trend has been consistent over time as we\u2019ve deepened our relationships with our target clients and gained market share, particularly as some peers have retrenched and reduced their global presence. Our strategy focused on providing integrated solutions to a targeted set of clients on a global basis is clearly yielding positive results. It does not mean that we would be immune to revenue swings in more market sensitive businesses like markets and investment banking, but our mix of traditional banking and transaction services does provide a stable, growing base of revenues in more efficient, higher return businesses where we believe revenues are likely to remain muted and we\u2019re taking appropriate measures to optimize our capacity without diminishing our client capabilities, and we are remaining disciplined on credit. So, while we will not be immune to credit cycles, we strongly believe that our focus on larger multinational clients should result in better performance through the cycle. All of these reasons are why we are still confident that our ICG business is capable of producing an RoTCE in the range of 14% in a more normal environment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Slide 15 shows the results for corporate/other. Revenues increased year-over-year, mostly reflecting higher investment income. And expenses were down, mainly reflecting lower legal and related costs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">On Slide 16 we show Citigroup\u2019s net interest revenue and margin trends. The bars represent net interest revenue per day for each quarter in constant dollars, showing consistent growth year-over-year in Citicorp while Citi Holdings has continued to shrink. Our net interest margin was 292 basis points this quarter, flat for the fourth quarter as the sale of OneMain was fully offset by the impact of higher rates. Our NIM should be fairly stable at this level in the second quarter as we continue to offset the impact of the wind down of Citi Holdings, with improvements in the core franchise. And we expect the acquisition of the Costco portfolio to provide a benefit of about 3 basis points, resulting in a NIM of roughly 295 basis points in the second half of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">On Slide 17, we show our key regulatory capital metrics, on a fully implemented basis. During the quarter, our CET1 capital ratio increased to 12.3%, driven by net income, OCI movements and approximately $1.6 billion of DTA utilization, partially offset by $1.5 billion of common share buybacks and dividends. Our supplementary leverage ratio improved to 7.4%. And our tangible book value per share grew by 9% year-over-year to $62.58.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Before we turn it over to questions, I\u2019d like to make a few comments regarding our expectations for full year 2016. Clearly, this year started with a more challenging environment than we had anticipated, resulting in lower revenues and a higher operating efficiency ratio than we had planned, even before the pull forward of certain repositioning actions into the quarter. While the expense saves resulting from these repositioning actions will help offset some of this pressure, we still expect our full year operating efficiency ratio to be higher than we had anticipated, in the range of around 58%. This outlook assumes that equity and fixed income market revenues will be roughly flat sequentially in the second quarter and then exhibit a normal seasonal decline into the third and fourth quarters. We believe investment banking revenues should recover from first quarter levels, if the environment is favorable, based on the significant backlog of deals we have pending with our clients. And we should be able to continue growing the accrual and transaction services businesses year-over-year in ICG, as I described earlier.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">On the consumer side, we continue to believe we can achieve year over year revenue growth in our existing U.S. branded cards and Asia cards businesses in the latter half of 2016. And of course, we will benefit from the acquisition of the Costco portfolio in June.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Turning to Citicorp expenses, there are a few things to consider. First, we believe that regulatory and compliance costs have started to plateau. And we expect the repositioning actions we took in the first quarter to payback with roughly $400 million of total savings during the remainder of the year. So, even though we expect to incur significant additional expenses related to Costco in the second half, we believe our core operating expenses in Citicorp can remain roughly flat sequentially going into the second quarter and then decline somewhat thereafter. Repositioning cost should be significantly lower for the remainder of the year. And in total, legal and repositioning costs should run in the range of about 225 basis points of Citicorp revenue this year, higher than our original estimate of 200 basis points, again due to lower revenue assumptions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">While this quarter\u2019s results were disappointing, we believe we are taking the right actions to address our cost base, while at the same time continuing to invest in those areas where we have a competitive advantage and can achieve strong returns over time. We continue to demonstrate strong capital generation this quarter and we remain highly focused on resource allocation across the franchise.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And with that Mike and I are happy to take any questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p8\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Question on energy, I appreciate the update, but that\u2019s a $30 oil or $40 now, obviously that can move. But do you think that if we stay above 40 that the pressure would be a little less should we think but how do we frame I guess oil prices if they remain higher?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yes. I think a little bit of that is going to be determined based upon where sentiment plays out. So, clearly when we set up these guidance for year and what we\u2019re looking at is the expectation, let\u2019s say oil in a band of 30 to 35. The oil consistently stays above 40 and especially on a forward curve, you see continued price increases, then yes, the credit costs that I quoted should be somewhat less.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay, but not dramatically so, materially higher?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">There will be somewhat less.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Fair enough, and just maybe a follow-up on the Costco acquisition. I appreciate the color on expenses. Should we expect that overall with all the puts and takes to be -- I think you initially were hoping would be modestly accretive, is that still the expectation?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Very modestly accretive. I mean, I think that\u2019s a net income. I think it\u2019s really going to be roughly flat, Jim. I mean that\u2019s I think the best way to think about it. We\u2019ll generate a buck or two of net income, but really the way to think about it is flat.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I just want to make sure I got all the moving parts, and I appreciate all the guidance. I think it\u2019s fair to assume, we\u2019re not going to model loan hedges, the hit that you took this quarter, the write down of Venezuela that happened this quarter. It sounds like with the new guidance, energy reserving could stay about this level, given your past comments to Jim\u2019s question. So, the big deltas from here over the next couple of quarters would be trading gets better and your comments about legal and repositioning being a lot lower. Have I got all the big moving pieces right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yes. And also, don\u2019t forget, we do believe that in the second half of the year, we are going to get year-over-year revenue growth coming out of the U.S. branded cards business as well as the Asia cards business, one as we see those investments begin to really kick-in on the final piece of the puzzle. We\u2019ve gotten new account acquisition, now we\u2019re seeing the receivable balances build, so that revenue growth now should be clearly visible in the latter part of 2016. And in Asia, again, credit cards, we believe that we\u2019re working our way through the last of the regulatory pressure and therefore we should get growth out of that business. But yes, I\u2019d say it\u2019s those things and then the continued growth of the accrual businesses and ICG, and the big wild card is going to be what happens with market sentiment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yes. And then, if we could drill down on the comments about markets. Obviously, January and February had a lot thrown at it and we all saw the weakness. Your comments for flattish markets revenues in second quarter, I think a lot of us were thinking like it\u2019s not great, but it\u2019s better than where we were in January and February. I\u2019m curious if there is more behind that conservatism besides just that we\u2019re not far out of the woods just yet?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Well, I think that March was clearly better than January and February. And April is kind of following along March\u2019s path. But I wouldn\u2019t call either March or early April robust, it\u2019s good, better than it was in January and February, but it\u2019s still not a robust market. So, maybe I\u2019m being a bit cautious, but I\u2019d rather be a little cautious and plan that way than say that everything is bounding back and it\u2019s all going to be a great and glorious second quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Fair enough. Last little one is the proxy came out, I was curious to see the elimination of the ROA target in the outset and go all in on total stockholder return. I think shareholders would like that piece, but I\u2019m curious on what brought the change?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Glenn, it\u2019s Mike. Your last comment of shareholders would like what?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">The fact that 100% of management\u2019s long-term incentive plan is now driven by total shareholder return, but I was curious on why the drop of the ROA component of it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Well, as John referenced in his comments, we\u2019re not walking away from targets and the disciplines in the firm having change. So John laid out the path of getting to 57 for the remaining three quarters, bringing us in somewhere around 58 in a reasonable environment through the year in firm, so ROA focused and all those. But realistically, we thought we would be transitioning here to much more of a return on equity set of targets; John spoke about some of the targets that we\u2019re putting into the businesses. And at the end of the day, really what you\u2019re looking at is the pathway to how we can get our firm to getting to the returns that you want and expect. And so maybe we were overly simplistic in the plan this year really just focusing on that. Again these plans are year-to-year will continue to take feedback and if that feedback is consistent out there, we\u2019ll think of those things as we go into the future.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So, just a quick one on the return on tangible outlook that you gave for both GCB and ICG, so, the 20% in GCB, I think you indicated a normal rate environment. Could you maybe give us some color around what normal is, John? And then in ICG, it was a bit more broad than normal. So, if you could maybe just help us understand what you mean by normal in ICG too?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Well, I\u2019d say that we think in terms of what we consider to be a normal environment. I\u2019d say you\u2019d start with certainly having a U.S. GDP growth something closer to 3% than the 2% that we\u2019re looking at and you certainly would have a higher GDP growth then coming out of the emerging markets. You would expect market sentiment, a little less volatility, less fear, driving improvements in markets as well as investment banking activities and none of that was clearly visible in the first quarter. And I\u2019d say a more conducive rate environment with let\u2019s just say a fed funds rate of about 200 basis points or so higher than where it is today. I think that would be a good start as far as trying to defining a more normal environment. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s beyond the realm of possibility.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And then next one, I am not sure what you can say but you guys got a very, very favorable living will outcome here this week and some investors pointed the fact that you\u2019ve highlighted a commitment to increasing capital returns in your deck upfront while certainly that\u2019s not a new goal for you thinking about CCAR right around the corner. Is there anything that you can add on those fronts and on the regulatory front and how those discussions are going?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I think the results we\u2019ve got in terms of the resolution planning was one where the whole firm came together to submit the plan, and we were obviously very pleased with the outcome. And in many ways, it\u2019s the same way we refocused the firm around our CCAR submissions. It\u2019s what we\u2019ve really tried to build into the fabric of the place. So, our investments that we put forward, we think on the qualitative side hopefully will show themselves. And again in this kind of environment, we\u2019ve been producing lots of capital. And we know we\u2019ve got to be in the position for meaningful capital return and we want to be on that path. So, we think that the submission we put in on CCAR was a strong one and we will see in June the results.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">You\u2019ve highlighted your progress, which is good reducing headcount, branches, consumer markets, holdings expenses and DTAs but the ROE, tangible ROE is still only 7%. Now, you did say that the results were disappointing and that you\u2019ll get better returns with a \"more normal environment\u201d, but from my standpoint having covered the -- for a long time, the market\u2019s not buying it. The stocks at 72% of tangible book value looks like this year will be the 10th in a row with returns below the cost of capital and note some large U.S. peers managed to have much higher returns. So, the question is why not do more?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So, the tactical question, which is I think is an easy one, if the efficiency ratio this quarter was 60%, you\u2019re guiding this year for 58%, that implies the next three quarters should be much better than 60%, if you could just clarify why that\u2019s the case. And the tougher one is the strategic question, can\u2019t you accelerate restructuring more than what you\u2019ve already done? You\u2019ve highlighted what you\u2019ve done but with the stock at 72% tangible book value, you should be selling the silverware in the dining rooms or the paperclips in the desk or that the desk chairs or the whole desk to free up capital buyback stock here. And the one area in particular I know we brought it up before, but why not sell Banamex, why not sell the Mexican bank, monetize that gain, use the DTAs to avoid paying taxes, avoid integrating it for Project Rainbow and use the proceeds to buy back stocks? What else can you do? And can you give us a sense of additional urgency because with the 7% ROE and 72% of tangible book value at stock price, it seems like you guys should be doing more?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Brennan had a two questions limit. Let us start, Mike, maybe I\u2019ll\u2026</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">You go and then I\u2019ll jump in.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So, let\u2019s talk about efficiency ratio. So, the comments that we made on the 58%, what we said is that the expectation would be that the repositioning actions that we took this quarter should begin to drive down expenses in the second half. And I think if you followed the revenue guidance that we gave, Mike, and the expense guidance that we gave that should get you to a point of about a 57% efficiency ratio for the balance of the year, that had been our guidance for the full year, tough to recover from the first quarter that we had but we felt that it was important to get the balance of the year back on the target that we had originally set. And we think that again with the outlook that we've put forward by and large we're there. So, that's on the efficiency aspect of it. As far as how we improve the returns and everything one of the things that you need to focus on is the fact that we do have $29 billion of capital tangible common equity tied up in DTA. It's hard for us and that's impossible for us to get a return on that capital, what we do in the back of the deck is we do show you that adjusting for that DTA capital even our current business over the last four quarters in the environment that it is whether you look at Citicorp or Citi Holdings, we're generating a 10% return on the capital excluding that capital tied up in DTA, and that's not making an excuse it's just showing you where we have the issue which means that we're really focused on driving down the DTA, utilizing the DTA which should add to the capital strength and which should then give us the ability overtime to return more capital to our shareholder, so that is definitely consistent with what we have been talking about.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And there's another element, we'll continue to drive down Citi Holdings. We've driven it down to where it is now at the level at it is, we've got still more assets to do, that is capital tied up in Citi Holdings that is not really earning an adequate return, we'll free that capital up, we'll return that capital to the shareholders. So, those are elements of the path forward and then the final is as we have put out we still believe that our consumer business is capable of generating a 20% RoTCE in a normal environment and the ICG of 14% in consumer we told you and we're focused, we're focused on cards and wealth management, we think that that's the right path forward, we think that's the right way to grow revenue, we think that those are both good efficiency and a high return businesses, we've got to focus on moving more of our account acquisition to digital channels that'll really benefit the efficiency ratio as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">In the ICG we've got a nice base selling in those accrual and transaction services business. 7% compound annual growth rate even in the somewhat challenging environment that we've all been operating in the last two years, investment banking we feel really good about that franchise, it's a bad quarter, there wasn't much deal volume. But we've got a very high backlog in investment banking and that's why we feel that those revenues should improve in the balance of the year. When it comes to our fixed income franchise, I don't think anybody can top our rates and currencies franchise. Even in this environment rates and currencies revenue is up 5% year-over-year and those are good performing businesses. I think our rates business really outperformed because basically foreign exchange was somewhat flat year-over-year, our real outperformance was in rates, we've got a great franchise in rates and our customers recognize that. We've got some work to do as far as adjusting capacities for our products, we're taking care of that and finally we're continuing to make investments in equities, the equities should help us overtime, it did not help us in this quarter. But that's the path forward Mike, we don't think it's the time to start selling the furniture Mike I don't know if you've got a comment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">If it\u2019d help I'll just close it with the conversation on Mexico because you specifically mentioned Mexico. Mexico for us is an important franchise and as John talks about the pathway to a 20% returns in the consumer businesses, Mexico plays an important role in there, and when we look at the business in every sense of the word it's accretive to the company and to its shareholders. Second piece around it is as we look at the growth prospects for Mexico and where we think Mexico as an economy is headed we like what we see and Banamex plays an important role in the Mexican economy around that. Third and final piece is, is if we were to take some type of action against Banamex based on capital planning and submission processes. You actually don't know how much of that capital would actually be liberated or entitled to go back to investors. So, it's a good business, it's a growing business, we think it's a strategically important business and simply selling the furniture to liberate some capital here we don't think is the right long-term or intermediate term decision.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">A question you touched on a couple of times, your backlog and investment banking, can you give us a little more color if it is it more North America or is it Asia? And then the second how does it compare to the end of December, has the backlog picked up from there or is about the same?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes, it's, backlog is up, we have probably got one of our best backlogs we've had in several years and you can think of the markets and just to put in context, yesterday was April 14th and realistically that was the opening of the IPO market here in the U.S. So, as you can imagine there's a fair number of things to do. So, when you think of that M&amp;A, when you think of about the equity calendar, if we can get some kind of reasonable environment, I think could see a lot of transactions coming through the pipe there. From our own perspective I think there's a good balance around the globe, U.S., Europe, Asia in terms of the backlog. So again if we can get any kind of reasonable environment we think we're going to be quite active.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And then in terms of what's going on in the UK with Britain thinking of leaving the EU, can you guys frame out if that happens what the risks could be to Citigroup?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes we guess from a Citi perspective but more importantly from a Citi client perspective we think that the EU staying together as it is, is the best outcome, but we'll leave that to the UK voters to decide. From our own perspective as probably you know, we operate in most of the 28 EU countries, and so we have a lot of flexibility in terms of what we could do. We run a significant bank out of Ireland, we have trading, we've got people in a number of the countries so we would have options in terms of where we would choose to headquarter a European trading business or where we would put, but clearly around the UK we would still have significant resources there, so we've got contingency planning but we've got a lot of potential options if that's the path it goes down.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And then just one last question on credit, I know you have given us good detail on energy. In the non-energy area there was some deterioration in credit, granted it wasn't as significant as energy. What type of industries was that deterioration in?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I mentioned the fact that some of the non-accrual loan as were in metals and mining. And the rest were small bits in other industries, no particular concentration, and no particular geography that I'm aware of. So it was just sort of spread around.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And actually it is continuing that, you had nice improvement in charge-offs in the consumer outside the United States. Do you expect that to continue especially in Asia and Latin America?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Well we don't see it getting any worse, as we look at the delinquency statistics I mean it's running pretty well, you have a total NCL rate outside the U.S. of 1.6% that's probably close to 70 basis points lower than the loss rate that we have in the U.S. and that's all-in including Mexico. So I don't want to say it's going to get much better, I'm not quite sure how much better it can get but I don't see it getting worse.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Chris Kotowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes looking at the global consumer bank, in the last couple of years you've given us guidance on positive operating leverage and maybe not on a quarterly basis but on an annual basis we saw that you delivered that in both 2014 and '15, and this year, I guess the first quarter doesn't look good and then you've got all these moving parts with Costco coming in and other jurisdictions being shutdown.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Chris Kotowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Can you give us an idea what is kind of the underlying same stores sales operating efficiency or leverage. Is there a positive operating leverage or is it just the card business revenue give ups are too much?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">It's going to be tough to overcome for this year. Especially with the large amount of repositioning then that we did in the first quarter, so I think it is going to hard to generate that type of story for 2016, but we do think then that again, the business that we're growing and the business that we're investing in is one that is going to be capable of generating on a consistent basis positive operating leverage and higher returns, so that's what we're trying to do Chris.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Chris Kotowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">It is where we are headed.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Chris Kotowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And then secondly kind of unrelated just if you can say on something like Venezuela where you, I guess you've written a investment there essentially down to zero, is there still an operating business there with optionality in case the situation business, and economic and political situation there ever turns around, or is it just basically more or less shutdown?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">No, we still have a good business serving our ICG clients that have particularly subsidiaries in that country so there's a -- if the country improves you should see a benefit coming out of that, and you're quite right. With the 180 write down that we took our remaining investment in that country is $4 million so it looks like it\u2019s headed for some really good ROE, if and when the business can come back.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">A couple of questions, just one on the restructuring and the cost this quarter and then the fade in of the 500 million that it's going to drive, so I just want to understand how much of the restructuring came in this quarter and then, I hear you that it will be coming through I just wanted to understand is the 500 million coming entirely through by the end of this year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">No we\u2019ll get about 400 of that in the last three quarters of the year. So that repositioning that we took in the first quarter largely we repay itself in the 2016 results. And that\u2019s exactly what Mike wanted us to achieve, so that\u2019s the way we really looked at that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. And so then right, so we have a little bit of benefit still piece in 2017 and then this quarter\u2019s results reflected some of the benefit of the restructuring you took last year. Is that accurate?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">That is correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And so with that restructuring you feel that within maybe a better market, not a normal market given how you define normal. You think you are at a good spot in the expense ratio that getting to 57%-56% is something you can achieve in 2017?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yes. I don\u2019t want to get into setting 2017 targets, because again I am still trying to figure out what the market environment is going to be for the balance of this year. But we do think that again everything that we\u2019re doing now is positioned to improve that operating efficiency and getting us close to that mid-50, that we\u2019re still targeting for Citicorp [Multiple Speakers] go ahead please.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">My basic question is just given more stabilized revenue environment the restructuring that you took this quarter feels like it\u2019s the last one you need to take of this magnitude. Is that reasonable or?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I think it\u2019s reasonable as long as market conditions stay where they are. I mean as we said if market conditions are weakened then there may be other actions that we need to take, we\u2019re not deaf to the need to do things in order to improve returns. We think that\u2019s the right way to run a business. So we\u2019ve got a model in place, we set the businesses with their goals, but if market conditions look as though those revenue environments are not going to come around then we\u2019ll need to take some additional actions hopefully as you said we\u2019re finished with large repositioning actions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And then just a couple others if could you talk just one is on the card portfolio you have highlighted the fact that you\u2019ve got two positive growth in the card portfolio this quarter, which is great and that in-spite of the legacy card portfolio. Could you just remind us the size of the legacy card portfolio and over what kind of timeframe you expect that\u2019s going to be rolling off?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">No, I don\u2019t want to split the portfolio like that I will tell you that the core portfolio that again where we\u2019ve been making the investments. Those obviously the performance that we\u2019re getting out of that portfolio is even better than what you see on Slide 9. So the purchase sales growth in the core portfolio where we\u2019re making the investments, the core products is 16%. The average open accounts is up 9%, the average card loans is up I think it\u2019s 4%. So you can see that again that\u2019s having -- that is really driving the growth, which is exactly what we would expect it to do and that\u2019s why we believe that by the second half of the year, we\u2019re going to get the entire card portfolio to the point where we\u2019ll have year-over-year growth. But again we\u2019re not finished then, because we would expect even more growth coming out of that core portfolio in \u201917 and \u201918. And again that\u2019s before we even talk about adding it in Costco. And Costco first year we have it Costco will not be contributing much just because of the way the accounting works, but we think that\u2019s a really good business and looking forward the contributions that will make in the second half of \u201917 and then into \u201918.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Last question is just on the reserving, that, not reserving, but the outlook for what could be a 1.4 billion if oil stayed at 30 a lot off caveats there and you mentioned that 400 million above what you had previously indicated two-thirds of which coming from regulatory guidance. Could you just give us a little bit of a color around, what you think that regulatory guidance is, why it might be different from what your views are, you have the other one-third of revisions of your views versus two-thirds from them?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Earlier this year, the OCC in particular came after the industry with some guidance first verbally and then in writing, largely centered as to how you should be treating some of the reserve based lending debt. And we still have some questions about how we are interpreting that guidance we think that in that 1.4 figure that I put out, we have taken the most conservative view as to how to interpret that guidance. But again we\u2019re still waiting to make sure that we have thought it, we\u2019ve interpreted that proper way.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I just had two quick questions, one on transferring Citi Holdings back into Citicorp now. Does that mean that we can expect really no announcements for future sales of businesses and you kind of finally reached this end state where you are happy with all your businesses?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Well, we still have the consumer businesses in Argentina, Brazil and Colombia that are in Holdings. They may or may not be sold this year. If they are sold next year, we\u2019ll probably tell you about it. So I don\u2019t think that you've heard the last of some of the business sales but again Holdings is just becoming it's just a normal way of doing business right now almost everybody has got something whether it is a portfolio or whatever.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And what you've talked about John as we've finished the quarter at 73, we've got commitments already in place for 10, so as John mentioned Argentina, Brazil, Colombia you've got an operating business to one main version for Citi Finance Canada got away from those it is largely an asset portfolio. And so you'll be able to see assets and crop other -- move up or down, and we can provide color inside around those, but we\u2019re going to keep the focus to get the transactions closed and out the door, but again I just don\u2019t think it is all that meaningful to the financials of the Company anymore.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Right, I guess I'm referring to new announcements from here on out there shouldn't be doing announcements about country exits in that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Obviously we will put out press released as we sign and as we close the transaction.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">What he is asking Mike is that are we going to have anymore sales and that's going to be dependent upon how we continue to assess the environment, if the environment says we need to scale back in some places we will be active in response to that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And there is one question on Costco I mean can you close to the close now can you provide any update on portfolio size anything besides the accretion numbers you just gave?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">No I mean the portfolio will close on or about June 20 as it should be June 20th where the portfolio closes and everything moves over. As we get closer to that date, we may give you some more, but for now we're just focused on the June date.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Just a follow-up on the Costco deal about neutral earnings this year as we think next year and beyond obviously there was some upfront marketing investments and system investments, but any thoughts on how profitable it could be longer term?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Well we haven't commented on the profitability of the individual portfolio and we won't do that, we will say it and we have said that the return characteristics of that portfolio it is perfectly into the cards business that we are trying to grow. So I have said on a number of occasions that our U.S. branded cards business should be one that when we are finished with the investments and adding in Costco and everything else, we think that it is a business that should earn an ROA somewhere in the 225 to 235 range. And Costco will be an important part of that it is -- the key to our U.S. cards business is to have a balanced portfolio, balance between our core proprietary products as well as the card portfolios where we have got our partner cards. So we think that's the right way to grow that business and that's the way we're moving forward and overall that business again 224 thereabouts ROA in the future.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And then circling back on expenses, the improvement in the efficiency ratio rest of the year and it sounds like it mostly revenue dependent, I guess the question is if revenues are weaker how quickly can you adjust to that environment, I am just trying to get some sense of how variable is the cost structure. We didn't see much variable at the point or but it is also this one quarter but as you think over the next several quarters if revenue comes a little lighter, do have flexibility to bring those costs lower than flat?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">What I actually tried to guide you to, is the fact that we think the core expenses will be actually coming down especially in the second part of the year. We don't anticipate having anywhere near the level of legal and repositioning charges that we had in the first quarter either. So we think that expense reduction in the balance of the year is an important element of getting to that 57% efficiency ratio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay so you are -- right, how much of it if -- how much variable in this just coming back to the variable in this question, I mean how much flexibility is there to further bring down and I guess I was a little surprised the first quarter we didn\u2019t see much variability in the expense given how weak revenue was, obviously you took the repositioning it's just one quarter, but if the revenue is less than what you laid out today, how much kind of real time flexibility is there to bring down cost?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">That is -- we would rest that as we see with the revenue, I am not going to give you a figure that X percent of the expense base is variable because on a longer term basis every things variable, on a shorter term basis it's not going to be as variable as you would like it to be.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Erika Najarian</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Just one other question for you Mike, I appreciate the color that you gave during the prepared remarks on CCAR and just a follow-up to that, are you confident enough or how confident are you in terms of checking off the regulator\u2019s qualitative to do list in terms of moving closer to our peers over the next few years in terms of payout especially in light of the kind of regulatory capital growth that Citi has enjoyed over the past couple of years?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yes, that's clearly exactly Erika what we're committed to we fully understand that capital generation and capital return is a big part of the investment thesis and story and if you go back and look over the past couple of years, capital generation hasn't been our issue, and over the last three years we've generated over $50 billion of regulatory capital in the last quarter we generated $6 billion of regulatory capital and so ours is the normalization around the process and the credibility to make sure that we can get that capital back to our investors and that's exactly, exactly what we're working at and that's why so much time and energy has been put it on the qualitative side of things to be able to get to that point as quickly as possible.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Erika Najarian</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And just, my follow-up is, John did I look at the headlines right, during your call with the media that the same group that was in-charge of resolution planning is also in-charge of CCAR?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I'm sorry, Erica.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Erika Najarian</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Sorry, I saw a headlines on Bloomberg when you were -- held your call with the media this morning that I think it is so that you mentioned the same group that was in-charge of resolution planning is also in-charge of CCAR?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yes you can't believe everything that you read online or in headlines, what I said was in my prepared remarks that during the Q&amp;A that I had with the media, that the question came up as far as resolution planning and I said look we put a lot of hard work into developing the resolution plan and that we really carefully incorporated all the feedback that we received in late 2014 on the earlier submissions and we've embedded resolution planning into our day-to-day management of Citi. And I said that is very similar to what we've done with CCAR, so rather than think of CCAR and resolution planning as separate initiatives performed by isolated teams of people you consider both as integrated parts of our capital planning process and I said just as we have a continuous budgeting and forecasting process that is owned by our business managers, well the business managers also own the CCAR process and the resolution planning process. So, that's what I had said.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Erika Najarian</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I see, thanks for the clarification John, I appreciate it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">That's okay it's not that we suddenly have got a new management -- that's the wrong way to run CCAR and resolution. To have somebody separate -- I mean Barbara guides CCAR I guide resolution but it's the business managers that ultimately own it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">John maybe just one more quick one on energy, I presume you're at least part of the way through the spring lease termination, I'm curious what your expectations are in terms of the potential reduction of the borrowing bases across your borrowers, when that process is complete?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Yes, we think that our reserve base lending exposure could be reduced by about $500 million, that would be combined the ICG as well as the consumer book, and it's probably 300-200, 350-150 with the ICG being slightly bigger piece of that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay that seems a smaller percentage than what we've heard from a couple of other lenders, just to [Multiple Speakers] if I can follow-up just on a separate topic, the 202, no I guess 225 basis points of revenue that you're suggesting we should think about in terms of repositioning in legal costs, how far does that guidance go out, I mean it sounds like with legal amounts sort of ramping down, certainly never going to go away, but ramping down and the repositioning costs presumably are going down overtime, should we think about that ratio in '17 and '18 and on out, are you going to be continuing to reposition in depth in places like wealth management?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Well I would say that again, we do think that 200 basis points and certainly 225 basis points is a very high charge on the revenues for legal and repositioning and it's relevant in the near-term 2016, we'll assess 2017 when we get there, but that would not be my view as to where we would expect legal and repositioning to be certainly beyond 2017. So, we should be looking at something which is a lot smaller but I'll give you more guidance as we get closer to the end of 2016.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay. And then just finally from me, maybe ticky tacky a little question, there was a substantial jump in the -- other than temporary impairment losses on the income statement this quarter to 465 million, is there anything you would like to call out there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Yes, Venezuela is in there, the Venezuela charge of $180 million, so that's a big piece of that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I had a quick question on capital, John in the past I know you have highlighted operational risk declines as a meaningful source of future capital release and at the same time you've often talked about CCAR as being your binding constrain on capital, and it's something that a lot of clients have mentioned as well as a potential source of release, and what I'm wondering is because of the stress test exam only evaluates capital ratios under the standardized approach which excludes op risk from the denominator, I'm wondering whether that renders any potential benefit tied to op risk release, move going forward. I just want to get a sense as to whether we should still be crediting that as a future source of release given that is as not contemplated explicitly within the capital ratios within CCAR?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Actually Steven I don't know whether I misspoke or you misheard, but it's probably my fault. But I don't think -- I certainly didn't intend to indicate that op risk would be a source of capital release as a matter of fact if anything I think that the op risk portion of the advanced approach RWA is very sticky right now. There just isn't a clear cut agreement either amongst us or even of the regulatory bodies really as to how you reduce op risk, so that's one of the reasons why when you've given you the Holdings\u2019 RWA in the past and this quarter for instance the Holdings' RWA is like $130 billion and of that $130 billion, $49 billion is op risk. That's the same 49 billion that was there in the fourth quarter, that's the same 49 billion that was there in the third quarter, so we really, we tend to think overall if you take a look at the Ks and the Qs I believe that our op risk RWA is like $325 billion and I consider that to be fairly sticky for now. Because I just don't have a good methodology in place to figure out how we drive that down. It's one of the very -- it frustrates me, I think it frustrates probably every CFO and Chief Risk Officer that you would talk to at a major bank right now, but that's kind of where we are.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Sorry, well thank you for clarifying that John and it certainly frustrates our investors and analysts as well. Just one question on the profitability targets, I know we spent quite a bit of time on it this morning but taking the challenging revenue by what we saw in 1Q the 100 basis point increase in the efficiency target and then the breakeven guidance for Holdings for the remainder of the year. Are you still committed to deliver on the 90 basis point ROA target that you had laid out, and I think reaffirm maybe as little as just one month ago?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I would say that given all of that math the 90 basis points, again given where we ended up in the first quarter, it's going to tough for us to come in at 90 basis points.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And just one more quick piggyback question from me, was wondering what the stores at RWA, RWA growth was in the quarter. I did see that the balance sheet grew as well, but didn't know if you could clarify that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">It's a little bit of the balance sheet growth and that's also being fuelled also by foreign exchange movements, we did, don't forget these are one day as opposed to being averages and so if you actually take a look at what happened at the end of March compared to where we were at the absolute end of December. In certain currencies the dollar actually weakened particularly against the euro, so that added $4 billion or $5 billion worth of RWA to us. We had some model changes that was like another 8 billion or 9 billion, we had I think $15 billion worth of just volume as the balance sheet grew and then there was a $5 billion increase in market risk which we're still looking at, that's why these are estimated numbers at this point in time don't forget. We'll lockdown the RWA calculations as we file the Q in a couple of weeks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ken Usdin</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Just a question on total cost of credit, we talked a little earlier about losses, we talked a little about the energy outlook for the rest of the year but John relative to kind of a 2 billion on cost of credit for the HoldCo, how should we just understand how that goes especially with not really knowing what Costco will add to that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Well any number that I gave you is ex-Costco, and I didn't give you a view towards what consumer would be, but don\u2019t forget Costco overall as I think I mentioned earlier you got to think in terms of Costco's revenue expense cost of credit being basically breakeven for the balance of this year and that's just due to the fact that the way the accounting works you're forced to build loan loss reserves, basically over the first year that you have the portfolio. So think about Costco as it'll impact all the ratios but from a net income point of view right now it's basically breakeven, so that's not in there, but the $1.4 billion that I gave you as for as the forward look on ICG, that was all-in that was not just energy that\u2019s all-in ICG.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ken Usdin</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay. So that\u2019s all-in including reserve builds, that\u2019s all-in. Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">That is all in.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ken Usdin</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And then do you think, I guess the last piece is if do you think, you\u2019ll continue to have any releases underneath in card or is it more just how the losses traject from here?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">As we continue to build the card portfolio, you are likely to see small reserve increases, that\u2019d be volume driven as opposed to being driven by a weakening in credit performance. So as you build portfolios, you do have to put aside reserve dollars. But again, we continue to believe that the credit performance in consumer whether it\u2019s on the U.S. book or international should continue to be very favorable.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">A question on the treasury and trade solutions outlook, obviously one area that\u2019s been sort of weak globally has been trade finance, particularly trade finance related to various commodities, which is a big portion of that, of the global total. So how do we think about that pressure relative to the pretty positive guidance and recent trend that you\u2019ve indicated?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Well, all of the trade performance is in that number that you see reported on whatever the slide number is 14 or 15 that is in the desk. So that\u2019s pretty much, how we\u2019re operating today. One of the things that we\u2019ve done overtime is we\u2019ve moved a lot more of our trade business, is being less balance sheet intensive. So it\u2019s we do a higher percentage of our business now on originate to sell and what that has given us is the balance sheet then to expand into the supplier finance aspects of trade. That has got better spreads and it really deepens the relationship then that we have with our client customers, so in recognizing everything you said, trade is not what I would call a tremendous growth business at this point in time. But it\u2019s got the relationship qualities to it and it\u2019s really adding to the overall franchise in a very positive way.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">So it sounds as if the volume pressures have been offset by basically moving down the ecosystem in terms of client opportunity, is that more or less correct?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s moving down the ecosystem. I\u2019d say that we\u2019re expanding the business that we can do with our target market clients by helping them in working capital management. And what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve gotten out a lot of the FI kind of sponsored business which is episodic it is very low spreads. We\u2019ll still originate those things, but then we tend to syndicate and so the trade finance receivable. So what we really want to do as we want to use trade as we do in almost every one of our product areas. We want to use our trade capabilities to help our clients manage their business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Vivek Juneja</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">A couple of questions, firstly John, you\u2019ve given the guidance last quarter, on net interest margin at 285 to 290 for the first half. You came in a little bit above that which was really flat linked quarter and are you still expecting to go to 285 to 290 for the first half and if so what would drive that down?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">No actually, what we\u2019ve revised our guidance to, as we think the 292 kind of holds flat in the second quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Vivek Juneja</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Again as we continue to offset the impact of Holdings\u2019 run off by a better spreads on our long business is largely due to the interest rate lift that we got, in coming out of December and by the tail-end of the year as we get the Costco of business on our books, that should be another boon to our NIM and we\u2019re expecting somewhere in the order of a 3 basis point improvement from Costco. So we should end the year the second half of the year with a NIM in the range of 295.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Vivek Juneja</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And Mike, a question for you, the equity of business, you\u2019ve had trading loss issues several times over the last couple of years. What are your plans to fix that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Yes so as you look at this quarter, this quarter wasn\u2019t a quarter where the revenue performance was a result of trading issues. This was really from our perspective, and I think you saw across the industry but certainly for us the client volume, client flow challenges and John and I talked historically about the run rate, we\u2019d like to see the business at in the opportunity and again going back, there is no reason why as a firm we should be in the 8-9 area, we should be in the 5-6 area and we think there is an incremental couple of hundred million dollars a quarter overtime that we can add with just some reasonable investments and the investments come in a couple of ways, it comes in terms of and it comes in terms of balance sheet and given where our capital ratios are given where our leverage ratios are, client finance is an example, we think we've got that opportunities to go in and take share, and that's what we're trying to execute on.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Vivek Juneja</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Okay. The only think I'd say is that the peers who are reporting so far your equity trading revenues year-on-year where weaker than those?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Yes they were.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Thank you.

Also as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Kendall, you may begin.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Susan Kendall</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you, Brent. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Mike Corbat, will speak first, then John Gerspach, our CFO will take you through the earnings presentation which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we\u2019ll be happy to take questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation may contain forward-looking statements which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results and capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including without limitation the Risk Factors section of our 2015 Form 10-K.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Michael Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you, Susan. Good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported earnings of $4 billion for the second quarter of 2016, or $1.24 per share. These results are a significant improvement from the first quarter not just in the overall amount of earnings, but in the proportion generated from our core business in Citicorp relative to the assets were winding down in Citi Holdings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">The results also show our institution\u2019s ability to generate solid earnings in a challenging and volatile environment. We grew both our consumer and institutional loan books, reduced our expenses, further reduced Citi Holdings\u2019 assets, and utilized additional deferred tax assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We meaningfully improved our efficiency ratio, our return on assets, and return on tangible common equity from the first quarter. We generated and returned capital to our shareholders and the plan which was just approved significant increases to the amount of capital we\u2019ll return over the next year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">In our institutional franchise, both our markets and investment banking businesses are rebounding client activity from the last quarter. And our treasury and trade solutions business continued to grow revenues as we won new mandates in support of our clients\u2019 needs around the world. These results really show the benefits of our global network and the competitive advantages it provides.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">In global consumer banking, we had positive operating leverage in our international franchise, highlighted by solid year-over-year growth in Mexico and continued sequential improvement in Asia. And as you know, we\u2019ve been investing in our U.S. branded cards business. On June 17, we acquired the Costco portfolio, gaining over 11 million cardholders in the process.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">And earlier this week, we announced the renewal of our partnership with American Airlines, and in retail services, we\u2019re renewing our partnership with the Home Depot. We\u2019re excited about the growth prospects of these businesses. In Citi Holdings, we drove another significant reduction of assets, which were down 10% from the first quarter and 47% from one year ago.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">For the eighth quarter in a row, Holdings was profitable and the $93 million in net income was just 2% of Citigroup\u2019s total earnings for the quarter. We passed a significant milestone in the utilization of our deferred tax assets, and in the second quarter, we utilized $900 million in DTA, bringing the total to $10 billion since the DTA reached its peak in 2012.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">While our remaining DTA does hamper, our return on tangible common equity utilization helps fuel our generation of regulatory capital. And as you know, returning that capital to our shareholders has been a critical priority of ours.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">During the quarter, we reduced our outstanding common shares by approximately $30 million, bringing the total to 105 million shares over the last four quarters. Even so, our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased to 12.5%. In addition, our tangible book value per share increased to $63.53 in the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We\u2019ve been clear about our desire to increase the capital return over time and earlier this month, we were pleased to learn that Federal Reserve did not object to the capital plan we submitted. And as a result, we\u2019ll return $10.4 billion in capital to our shareholders over the next four quarters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">The plan includes more than tripling our dividend to $0.16 per share and repurchasing $8.6 billion in common stock. This result combined with the feedback we received from the Fed and the FDIC on our resolution plan shows the progress we continue to make to becoming a safer and stronger institution.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Looking forward, the environment remains challenging. We\u2019re continuing to navigate the consequences of the UK referendum on the EU from its economic impact to how exactly it will structure our legal vehicles to continue to best serve our clients. And while the UK has a new leader, the U.S. is still in the midst of a unique presidential campaign and such geopolitical and economic uncertainty doesn\u2019t create a clear picture for potential interest rate increases.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">I think we\u2019ve navigated the most recent volatility very well as a result of our strategic client segmentation and strong risk management. Our credit quality remains very high and our institution is showing its resilience and strength of our model. While there has been a high degree of uncertainty in the wake of the referendum, the capital markets are open, strategic transactions are getting done, and we feel good about the client activity we\u2019re seeing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">And while we don\u2019t know what\u2019s coming \u2013 what will come in the months as we look forward, we\u2019re always going to be looking at and continuing to optimize our resources. And I believe, we\u2019re very well-positioned from the capital, liquidity, and capacity perspective. John will now go through the presentation and then we\u2019d be happy to answer your questions. John?</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 3, we show total Citigroup results. Revenues of $17.5 billion declined 8% from last year, but expenses decreased 5%, each driven primarily by the continued wind down of Citi Holdings, as well as the impact of foreign exchange translation. And credit costs improved, reflecting lower net credit losses, partially offset by a smaller net reserve release compared to the prior year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We earned $4 billion in the second quarter, or $1.24 per share, each down 14% versus the prior period. Our preferred dividends were higher this quarter. However, we were able to offset this impact through share buybacks, which drove a 4% decline in our average diluted shares outstanding. In constant dollars, Citigroup end of period loans grew 2% year-over-year to $634 billion, as 6% growth in Citicorp was partially offset by the continued wind down of Citi Holdings, and deposits grew 5% to $938 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On Slide 4, we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Citicorp is the predominant driver of profitability in the second quarter, contributing 98% of total net income. Citicorp revenues of $16.7 billion were down 3% from last year on a reported basis. In constant dollars, Citicorp revenues were flat to the prior year, as growth in our institutional franchise was offset by lower consumer revenues and the absence of prior period real estate gains in Corp other.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Citicorp expenses decreased 1%, reflecting efficiency savings and a benefit from FX translation, partially offset by continued investments in the franchise. And cost of credit grew 13% from the second quarter of last year, driven by a smaller reserve release versus the prior year. Credit quality remained broadly favorable across the franchise and net credit losses declined 5% year-over-year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Pre-tax earnings of $5.7 billion in Citicorp were down from last year, but improved over 25% sequentially on higher revenues, lower operating expenses, and the lower cost in credit.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to Citi Holdings, both revenues and expenses declined significantly year-over-year, as we continue to wind down the portfolio. We reduced Citi Holdings\u2019 assets by $7 billion this quarter, ending the period with $66 billion of assets, or just 4% of total Citigroup, with signed agreements in place to sell $7 billion of this amount.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning now to each business, Slide 5 shows the results from North America consumer banking. Total revenues declined 3% year-over-year. Retail banking revenues of $1.3 billion grew sequentially, but were down 4% from last year, as continued growth in consumer and commercial banking was more than offset by lower mortgage activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Average retail banking loans and checking deposits grew 10% and 9% respectively from last year. In branded cards, revenues of $1.9 billion were down 1% from last year, as a modest benefit from the Costco portfolio, which we acquired on June 17, was offset by the continued impact of higher rewards costs in our existing portfolio, as well as higher payment rates.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">I\u2019ll talk more about branded cards in a moment, but we continue to see good momentum from the investments we\u2019re making in our core products. In addition, the early results from Costco have been very encouraging. New account acquisitions have far exceeded our expectations at over 337,000 to-date.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Purchase sales for the first 3.5 weeks totaled $5.7 billion, with roughly two-thirds being out of store, and the loan portfolio, which we acquired at $10.6 billion in size had already grown to a $11.3 billion by the end of the second quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Costco is a great partner and we\u2019re excited about the potential for this business. We\u2019re also very pleased with the renewal of our American Airlines partnership, which was announced earlier this week. We will continue to be the exclusive issuer of credit cards in the majority of acquisition channels, including digital and mobile channels, direct-mail, e-mail, phone and Admiral\u2019s Club lounges. At the same time, we were able to maintain a high-quality growing portfolio and attractive returns.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">The impact of the renewal should lower pre-tax earnings by approximately $50 million per quarter through the end of next year, primarily due to higher expenses, including the amortization of intangibles. This impact on pre-tax earnings is expected to increase somewhat in 2018 and beyond, as certain additional revenue sharing arrangements become effective.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Finally, turning to retail services, revenues of $1.5 billion decreased 4% from last year, reflecting the absence of two portfolios we sold in the first quarter, as well as the impact of renewing and extending several partnerships, principally Home Depot. We now have all of our significant partnerships in retail services secured through 2020 or beyond. We expect revenues to remain around this $1.5 billion level per quarter through the end of next year, as expected volume growth is likely to be offset by the impact of absorbing the more competitive terms in our partnership renewals.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We currently expect to operate the retail services business at an ROA in the range of 250 basis points. And we remain open to inorganic growth through new programs and acquisition opportunities, given the right strategic fit and return profile. Total expenses of $2.4 billion in North America increased 5%, driven by the Costco portfolio acquisition, as well as continued marketing investments, partially offset by efficiency savings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">And finally, credit cards in North America increased 13% from last year, mostly reflecting a reserve building branded cards, driven by volume growth and the impact of Costco compared to a reserve release in the prior period.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On Slide 6, we show results for international consumer banking in constant dollars. In total, revenues were flat and expenses declined 1% from last year. In Latin America, consumer revenues were up 4%, as continued growth in retail banking, which grew 7% year-over-year, was offset by a decline in cards. These retail banking results reflect strong volume growth, with average loans and deposits increasing 8% and 10%, respectively. Latin America cards revenues declined 3% from last year. However, we are seeing continued signs of recovery in that business with purchase sales of 7% versus last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">And finally, expenses declined 5% year-over-year in Latin America, mostly on lower legal and repositioning costs, resulting in significant positive operating leverage. Excluding the impact of the gain on the sale of our merchant acquiring business in the third quarter of last year, we expect this positive operating leverage to continue in the second-half of 2016.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to Asia, consumer revenues declined 4% year-over-year, driven by lower wealth management and retail lending revenues, while cards revenues were flat to the prior year, which I\u2019ll discuss more in a moment. Expenses grew 2% in Asia, in part due to higher repositioning costs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On Slide 7, we show Asia consumer in more detail. While wealth management revenues were down year-over-year, we did see sequential growth in both revenues and AUM inflows during the quarter, with a declining year-over-year trend in AUMs, driven by the impact of lower equity market values. We also saw improvements in card revenues, which were flat to last year, and we continue to believe, we are on track to deliver year-over-year growth in the second-half of 2016.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Retail banking revenues, excluding wealth management were also up sequentially, but declined 2% year-over-year, mostly reflecting the repositioning of our retail loan portfolio away from lower return mortgage loans, as well as some derisking in our commercial portfolio. These actions were partially offset by 3% growth in personal loans as you can see on the lower right.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">The net impact was a decline in lending revenues year-over-year in the second quarter. However, we expect these revenues to stabilize in the second-half of the year with continued growth in higher return personal loans, and therefore, an improvement in the overall yield of the portfolio. In total, we expect Asia consumer revenues to return to growth in the second-half of 2016, resulting in positive operating leverage year-over-year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On Slide 8, we show some key performance indicators for our global branded cards franchise, including year-over-year growth in purchase sales, average card loans, and revenues.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In North America, as you can see, these trends show a positive improvement from the Costco portfolio acquisition. But even excluding that transaction, we continue to show solid progress in our existing franchise, with organic growth in purchase sales and average loans of 10% and 3%, respectively, and improving year-over-year revenue trend, which we expect to turn positive in the fourth quarter of 2016.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Turning to Asia, as I discussed earlier, card revenues were flat to the prior year, as we continued to move past many of the regulatory headwinds in that region. Growth in purchase sales slowed this quarter in Asia, in part due to actions we took to lower the value of rewards on certain products in Australia. In response to regulation that capped interchange rates in that market.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We moved ahead of the market in changing our rewards program, and this had a dampening effect on purchase sales this quarter. However, we expect these trends to recover, as peers follow suit and consumers adjust to the new programs. We also reduced promotional rate balances during the quarter, which had a positive effect on yields. But combined with the slower purchase sales growth, this resulted in more modest loan growth year-over-year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We have continued to manage well through the economic environment in Asia, which have seen slower overall market activity relative to last year. And finally, in Latin America, the trends are improving as well, with a sustained recovery in purchase sales beginning to drive loans and revenues. With continued momentum in the back half of the year, we would expect to see loan growth turn positive again year-over-year with revenue growth to follow thereafter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Slide 9 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail. Credit remained broadly favorable again this quarter with stable to improving NCL and delinquency rates in every region. The NCL rates in Latin America showed particular improvement this quarter, reflecting seasonal payment trend. We expect the NCL rate in Latin America to return to around 4.5% for the second-half of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On Slide 10, we show the year over year EBT walk for consumer on a year-to-date basis. We continue to face headwinds from market sensitive businesses like wealth management and mortgage on a first-half basis. As you can see, the continued impact of our cards initiatives on revenues as well, which should abate as we go into the second-half of the year. But the year-over-year impact from regulatory headwinds has slowed from the first quarter, and the impact of business growth has become more pronounced, driven by the momentum we\u2019re seeing in our retail and commercial businesses in North America and Latin America.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Our expense growth in the first-half was predominantly driven by investments across our franchise, as well as higher repositioning charges in the first quarter, and credit headwinds reflect the absence of prior period reserve releases. Underlying credit quality has remained stable with the net loss rate declining year-over-year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Turning now to the institutional clients group on Slide 11, revenues of $8.8 billion in the second quarter grew 2% from last year, driven by fixed income and treasury and trade solutions. Total banking revenues of $4.4 billion declined 2%. Treasury and trade solutions revenues of $2 billion grew 9% from last year in constant dollars, driven by continued growth in transaction volumes with new and existing clients.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We continue to capture market share and saw strong momentum across payment products, such as U.S. dollar clearing, as well as commercial cards, where purchase sales grew 9% year-over-year. Our focus remains on delivering integrated working capital solutions to our multinational clients, addressing their full spectrum of supply chain, trade services, liquidity management, procurement and payment needs around the world. We\u2019re seeing the demand for our services increase, as corporations seek to optimize their resources in a slow growth environment, at the same time, some of our peers are pulling back from global strategies.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Investment banking revenues of $1.2 billion were down 6% from last year, mostly on lower industry-wide equity underwriting activity, but showed a significant improvement from the prior quarter, reflecting a rebound in both market conditions, as well as our wallet share in all major products.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Private bank revenues of $738 million were down 1% year-over-year on lower managed investments and capital markets activity. And corporate lending revenues of $389 million were down 18%, as higher loan volumes were more than offset \u2013 more than offset by an adjustment to the residual value of a lease financing as well as higher hedging costs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Total markets and security services revenues of $4.7 billion grew 10% from last year. Fixed income revenues of $3.5 billion were up 14% from last year. Rates in currencies drove these results, with revenues up 25% year-over-year, including particularly strong performance in the days following the UK referendum. We saw continued growth in activity throughout the quarter with our corporate client base, which comprises over 40% of our direct client revenues in rates and currencies.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We believe a greater portion of our rates and currencies revenues are generated with corporate clients relative to that of our peers, which is directly tied to the strength of both our global network and our treasury and trade solutions business. We view this as a differentiating advantage and one that provides scale and stability to our fixed income platform. Spread product revenues declined this quarter versus last year. However, on a sequential basis, we did see a recovery particularly in securitized products.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Turning to equities, excluding the valuation adjustments in the prior year of approximately $175 million, our revenues were down 4% year-over-year, driven by lower market activity, as well as the comparison to strong trading performance in Asia in the prior year. And sequentially, revenues grew 12%, reflecting improved performance in derivatives.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Finally, in security services, revenues declined 3% year-over-year in constant dollars, mostly driven by the absence of revenues from divestitures. Excluding this impact, underlying revenues were up 2%. Total operating expenses of $4.8 billion were down 2% year-over-year, driven by repositioning savings and a benefit from FX translation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On a trailing 12-month basis, excluding the impact of severance, our comp ratio remained at 27%. Total credit costs of $82 million were higher than last year, but down significantly from the prior quarter. Total net credit losses were $141 million, with roughly two-thirds offset by related reserve releases. We also built roughly $30 million of reserves related to non-accrual loans, which increased by approximately $135 million during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">The cost of credit related to energy was minimal, as net credit losses were mostly offset by previously existing reserves and the portfolio benefited from the stabilization in oil prices, as well as increased capital markets activity. Given our target client focus on high-quality corporate credits, certain energy clients were able to access the capital markets as the market environment became more favorable in the second quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">This allowed these clients to improve liquidity, resulting in either paydowns or improvements in the credit quality of our exposures. And our reserve-based energy exposures declined this quarter by roughly $400 million in ICG, reflecting the impact of the spring redeterminations. We provide more details on our energy portfolio in the appendix to our earnings presentation. Outside of energy, the cost of credit was concentrated in a few specific credits.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Looking forward, we remain cautious and the environment is uncertain, but we could see total ICG cost of credit in the back-half of the year in the range of $300 million to $500 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On Slide 12, we show the year-over-year EBT walk for ICG on a year-to-date basis, which shows significant improvement from the first quarter. We continue to see first-half growth, although modest in our accrual and transaction services businesses, despite certain headwinds this quarter, led by our continued momentum in treasury and trade solutions. And with the strong second quarter performance in markets, we are now flat to last year in fixed income and equities, but remain down year-over-year in investment banking, given lower overall market activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">We remain disciplined in our core expense management, as we work to realize the benefits of the repositioning actions taken earlier this year to address the structure and capacity in certain parts of our franchise. These higher repositioning costs alone drove approximately $240 million of EBT decline year-over-year in the first-half. The remaining EBT drivers were the write-down of our investments in Venezuela, mark-to-market losses on loan hedges driven by spread movements, and of course, the higher credit costs in energy in the first quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Slide 13 shows the results for corporate/other. Revenues decreased year-over-year, mostly reflecting the absence of real estate gains in the prior year, as well as the lower debt buyback activity, and expenses increased driven by higher corporate-wide marketing expenses and an increase in legal and related costs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">On Slide 14, we show Citigroup\u2019s net interest revenue and margin trends. The bars represent net interest revenue per day for each quarter in constant dollars, showing consistent growth year-over-year in Citicorp, while Citi Holdings has continued to shrink.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Our net interest margin was 286 basis points this quarter, lower than our initial outlook of around 292 basis points, driven by an equal combination of higher cash balances, lower trading NIM, and lower low yields. Looking to the second-half of the year, NIM should recover to around 290 basis points or slightly higher, driven by a 3 basis point improvement from Costco, as well as the normalization of average cash balances. This is lower than our prior outlook of around 295 basis points for the remainder of the year, reflecting somewhat lower loan yields, as well as the absence of a previously assumed rate increase in the U.S.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">On Slide 15, we show our key capital metrics. During the quarter, our CET1 capital ratio increased to 12.5%. Our supplementary leverage ratio improved to 7.5%, and our tangible book value per share grew by 7% year-over-year to $63.53.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Before I turn it over to questions, let me make a few comments on our outlook for the third quarter. In consumer banking, revenues in North America should grow sequentially, driven by branded cards, mostly reflecting the impact of the Costco acquisition, which should generate incremental revenues of roughly $200 million over the second quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">International consumer revenues should grow modestly from the second quarter, resulting in year-over-year improvement in both Asia and Mexico, excluding the gain on the sale of our merchant acquiring business last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Turning to the institutional business, we expect market revenues to reflect the normal seasonal decline from the second quarter, while investment banking revenues should be largely stable, assuming that market conditions remain favorable. And we expect continued year-over-year growth in our treasury and trade solutions business, as we continue to win new mandates and support our clients day-to-day banking needs around the world.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Finally, to complete the revenue picture in Citicorp, Corp other revenues are expected to be close to zero, down from recent levels in the $100 million to $200 million, driven by a lower debt buyback activity and the absence of certain other episodic gains.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Core expenses in Citicorp should be slightly down from the second quarter, reflecting the impact of repositioning savings, partially offset by higher expenses related to Costco and other branded cards investments. And credit costs in Citicorp should be somewhat higher than the second quarter, mostly driven by reserve builds for volume growth and the impact of the Costco portfolio acquisition. Citi Holdings should be at break-even for the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And with that Mike and I are happy to answer any questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hey, good afternoon guys.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hey, Jim.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Just a question on the energy credit, you \u2013 I think you said in June around $1.2 billion of, I think, energy-related credit costs. I think if I my math is right, you did about $500 million year-to-date, and now you\u2019re seeing $300 million to $500 million in the second-half, is that right? So, 8 \u2013 is that kind of way to think about $800 million to $1 billion right now?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Well, the $1.2 billion, Jim, that was our reference to total Citi \u2013 total ICG cost of credit, that was not specific to energy\u2026</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay, fair.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">...at that point in time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So is \u2013 it does seem like it\u2019s a little bit of a step-down versus expectations even\u2026</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Well, certainly \u2013 it certainly, when you take a look at the first-half, which you know is about $500 million cost of credit in ICG. And with the second-half range of $300 million to $500 million, that gives you your comparison of $800 million to $1 billion against the previous $1.2 billion. So, yes, it is a step-down.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And is that just simply the improvement in the capital markets in what you\u2019re seeing in terms of experience with the energy space and then getting capital, is that the big change, or is it oil prices or just the combination of both?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Well, it\u2019s a combination of both. And certainly, we\u2019re benefiting \u2013 that outlook benefits from what we\u2019re seeing as a stabilization of energy cost with oil in that $45 barrel range. So I think, it also reflects the overall resiliency in our credit portfolio, which is what we\u2019ve been talking about. Now, we described to you the quality of our energy exposure in the past. First quarter, even in the first quarter, we said 73% of our energy exposure was to investment-grade names that has continued to remain at 73% in the second quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Right.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">The funded loan book at the first quarter was 63% investment grade, that\u2019s actually improved now to 65%. And because we\u2019re concentrated in those high-quality names, they do have access to capital markets and therefore are able to strengthen their balance sheets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Right. An E&amp;P balances were down too. So, okay\u2026</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yes, I mean, when you take a look at what we\u2019ve been able to do, we traded off. We reduced the high risk portfolio and remained more concentrated in the high-quality portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Right. Maybe just one follow-up on Costco, it seems like it\u2019s off to a pretty good start. You\u2019re obviously going to be building reserves there. Do you expect it to be added to the earnings, neutral to earnings, as we think about the combination of expenses, revenues, and provision build?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Jim, our view going into the acquisition is that, in this first year in 2016, it would likely be neutral to earnings just because of the mechanics behind the reserve build. And so that\u2019s our view right now. We\u2019ll give you more updates as to how it could impact 2017, certainly as we get later in the year. But for now, I\u2019d say 2016 on EBT point of view is basically neutral.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Right. So still sticking to neutral. Okay, thanks a lot.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay, Jim.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hi, thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hey, Glenn.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hello there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hey, Glenn, can you speak up a little bit. We really can\u2019t hear you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Really? I\u2019m screaming into it, sorry.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Sorry.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">No problem, no problem. In cards, when I take a step back and I look at all the either renewal up rates or the acquisition costs, like cards is a super tough business right now, or I should say super competitive business right now. So I heard your comments about the 250 basis point ROA on the retail partner. Could you maybe talk about where the cards overall ROA and RoTCE is now and where it should be going forward, it kind of follows on, on Jim\u2019s question. I just like \u2013 just want to make sure we\u2019re growing profitability here and not just volume, important business for you guys?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Well, again, as we\u2019ve said, longer-term we \u2013 our view is from a branded cards portfolio, we want to be running that portfolio at about 225 to 235 basis points, which really is consistent with where we were entering into the crisis. So, what you\u2019ve seen through the crisis is a \u2013 an impact on ROA first with a severe downturn in ROA, as everybody built reserves and worked their way through the credit issues and then coming out now we\u2019ve all benefited from reserve releases.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So today, where we were getting ROA in branded cards something close to 300 basis points, but a lot of that has been fueled by reserve releases. The business that we\u2019re building in branded cards is one that is set to yield in ROA of 225 to 235 basis points, where we were going into the crisis and with a better more higher quality book of business. And it\u2019s the same story with retail services that 250 basis points is what we think is a realistic long-term return with that business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Got it, I appreciate that. You mentioned the renewal on American, most of the channels, I saw that Barclays had gotten, I think, it was the airports and on the plane, which I\u2019m not sure what that means. But what percentage of the originations in the past came from those channels, like do I care?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Well, I mean, it certainly is a smaller amount of the originations than what we believe that we are going to be able to achieve through the channels that we retain. The on-airline and in-airport the \u2013 I\u2019d call it the travel day type of acquisitions, that was not a particular strength of ours anyway.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay, I appreciate that. One last one on, which one to choose? Okay, I saw the commentary on the more preferreds coming. With capital and leverage ratios so strong, like really strong and a payout ratio still at 70%, I\u2019m just curious where the incremental preferreds \u2013 what\u2019s their purpose, where they are going and why do you need them?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Glenn, maybe I misspoke or \u2013 but we\u2019re not signaling that we are issuing more preferreds. We\u2019ve done our preferred issuance for now, given the capital stack that we have right now, our preferreds are where they are. But that did since we now are settled for a couple of quarters you\u2019re going to see the preferred dividend than increase over where they were prior year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Oh, no problem, I got it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I appreciate it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So if you take a look at Slide 32, that just sort of, we just want to level set your expectations as to where preferred dividends will be reflected. But all these preferred dividends reflect issuances already done.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Totally appreciate it. Thank you. I appreciate it. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay, Glenn. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Bye, John.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Hi, good morning. As Mike noted, the earnings came in nicely better than the first quarter. Just wondering, John, what are some of the items that got better since the early June guidance that earnings looked kind of flattish with the first quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I\u2019d say several things improved, John. Clearly, the markets \u2013 markets revenues were improved. What we found is during the month of June, we were able to engage with our corporate clients. They were seeking advice as to how to handle a volatility, both leading up to the UK referendum and then certainly subsequent to the UK referendum and that that gave us a great opportunity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">But at the same point in time, because the capital markets remained open during the month of June, we did benefit from a lot of our energy clients then being able to access the client, so that produced a much lower cost of credit than I think Mike had probably indicated when he spoke at the conference at the early part of June.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And finally, we saw improved momentum in Mexico in the retail bank during the month of June. We noted that overall consumer revenues in Mexico grew 4% year-over-year that was higher than what we had thought that was going to be when Mike spoke. So we had momentum building in Mexico. We had good engagement with clients throughout the whole UK referendum. And then we benefited from the lower cost of credit again because of the high-quality of our book.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. And you mentioned the corporate credit getting better and you gave an outlook for the cost of credit for ICG looking ahead. How should we think, John, about the provision trend in cards and overall consumer going forward from here?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Well, again, that\u2019s going to intend to increase for two reasons. One is, as we build additional ANR and we\u2019re definitely in a growth mode when it comes to our card \u2013 our branded cards book. We\u2019re going to meet to build reserves just because of the volume. And then with Costco, again, when you get into purchase accounting, you\u2019ve got a heavy front-end build on LLR.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. And then just one final thing on Costco, as you mentioned, that\u2019s starting to grow and you\u2019re getting the accounts. There have been some press stories and anecdotal reports of difficulties in the initial roll out. Were there some operational snafus that occurred? Have they been fixed and is everything running right now? Could you just give us an update on that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">John, it\u2019s Mike. I would say that we experienced extremely high calling volumes in the early implementation of it. We\u2019ve put a lot of resources at it, questions around card activation, questions around statements, questions around where to send payments. And so we\u2019re working through that. We\u2019re gaining on it. We\u2019re very focused on it. We\u2019ve got a lot of resources deployed against it and it\u2019s something we can fix in the short order.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. But you did mention John that the accounts are growing, sign-ups have been good?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">It\u2019s definitely are growing. I mean 330,000 new card acquisitions just since we took over the book that far exceeded our expectations by a factor of 2 and 2.5 times. So, again, we\u2019re really excited about. I think it speaks to the quality of the value proposition that that we put forward with that card in partnership with Costco.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Right. So just dealing with the volume operationally is what you\u2019re still working through?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes, again, as Mike mentioned, the call wait times are coming down, but it\u2019s, yes, it\u2019s probably it\u2019s not the largest, it\u2019s got to be one of the largest portfolio implementation transfers on a single day that\u2019s ever been attempted. And that\u2019s not to give us excuses, I mean, we should be performing better than we are, but we\u2019re working on that. But again, it\u2019s a massive program.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Hi, Brennan.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">On card another one here, the velocity in North America has been really, really good in both purchase volume and ANR. How long should we think about that sustaining and given some of the deals you\u2019ve just walked down from a modeling perspective how long can that sustain?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Well, that\u2019s a great question. We don\u2019t anticipate the same level now. You\u2019ve got two things, two factors. One is Costco obviously is going to benefit as now for the next year, so we\u2019re going to get a tremendous pickup from Costco. As in Costco though, we will begin on an ex-Costco basis some of that growth and we have 10% growth this quarter in purchase sales year-over-year, excluding Costco. That will begin to moderate sometime around towards the end of this year, the beginning of next year. But, again, we still anticipate getting good volume growth, but you\u2019re not going to get the same bump that you have when you start an investment program.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">All right. Okay, thanks. We also recently heard about some of your competitors widening out their credit box in card in recent years. Have you guys done that too? Have we seen a shift down within the Citi portfolio a bit of an expansion as far as credit, or can you maybe give a little color on that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">We\u2019re still focused on the same target client that we had going in. If we moved by a basis point or two in FICO, that\u2019s about it. But when you take a look at where we\u2019re focused right now, it\u2019s still on that same target clients that I described to you in the past. And with the renewals that we\u2019ve done and with the new partnership with Costco, I think that speaks to the type of clients that we\u2019re really looking to build on.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Terrific. Just wanted to make sure. And then last one from me, the card trends in Asia, I appreciate your comments on the lower rewards in Australia. But when we look at the loan balances, it doesn\u2019t look like Australia is really all that big. Can that really move the needle? Can you help us understand how that would actually drive that those metrics?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Well, again, it\u2019s not going to drive in this quarter in ANR, but it is going to drive purchase sale. So we have a lot of usage coming out of Australia. So the drop-down in Australia itself cost us a full percentage point on purchase sale growth year-over-year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. And then that will probably just sustain for a year that lower volume, because it sounds like that\u2019s probably pretty structural, given the changes in that market?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Well, what I would actually think is that as the other card issuers in Asia also adjust their rewards programs, what you\u2019ll see is less of an impact where people stop using their Citi Card. And as the programs become more consistent and more competitive with each other, we should get a pickup back again. So I don\u2019t think that this is more than a one or two quarter blip down in purchase sale growth in Asia.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. And have you seen competitors move yet or just you\u2019re just anticipating it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I don\u2019t have anything particular in front of me that that would indicate what we\u2019ve seen yet on behavior. We\u2019ll get back to you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Sounds good. Thanks a lot.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">All right.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Hi. John, you touched on Mexico earlier, but can you talk about Mexico or more generally where do you see it in its profit cycle in addition to just consumer what you said is improving. And then a question for Mike, under what circumstances would you consider a sale of Mexico? I know that that\u2019s in the past, but your discount tangible book keep getting steeper and steeper especially as your tangible book value continues to cost?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So to handle the first part of that question, Mike, there we were seeing good momentum throughout our Mexico franchise. We\u2019ve actually had great momentum in our ICG business in Mexico throughout the past year, year-and-a-half. It\u2019s consumer where we had a bit of a slowdown in that momentum, which we\u2019re now working our way out of, which is why we find getting 4% year-over-year revenue growth to be a nice start positive operating leverage this quarter, positive operating leverage in the back-half of this year. We anticipate having positive operating leverage coming out of the consumer business in Mexico straight on through 2017.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So we\u2019ve got an improving cards picture. We\u2019ve got a vibrant retail banking picture going on in Mexico. So we see that as an engine for growth out into the future.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And, Mike, from the strategic perspective, it really dovetails off of what John just described we like \u2013 as we have talked about. We like the demographics of Mexico, the growth prospects, where they are now post reforms. The position of Banamex in terms of its retail and consumer franchise, the scale of that our ability to compete. And so in a world that we see, at least, for the future ahead of us right now growth in the world\u2019s are pretty tough thing to find. We think Mexico offers that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So based on what we see and what we think the opportunities are in the franchise, we think it\u2019s accretive to our shareholders. The return are solid, and we think we\u2019ve got the ability to continue to expand those. So right now, I really don\u2019t see a scenario, where we would contemplate selling.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">The spirit behind the question and I know you, you understand this. I mean tangible book is close to 64 and the stock price is $44, and at some point the best investment is buying back your own stock. And but you created asset sale gains to, be allowed to buyback more stock, it\u2019s not something you should consider and you\u2019ve made a lot of strides. You discard many consumer operations outside the U.S. You reduced the size of Citi Holdings. Can\u2019t you reaccelerate some of that restructuring?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Well, if you look we just announced a pretty meaningful capital return. We\u2019re in the market and we\u2019ll be buying back $8.6 billion worth of stock over the next four quarters. As you look at our math and you look at our capital return capacity, we\u2019re going to have a lot of ability to buy stock back.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And when you think about the trade-offs between the stock buyback and growth, you\u2019ve got to find the right balance. So, again, if we can execute on the things that we want to execute, create the earnings, continue to liberate the DTA, we\u2019re going to have a lot of firepower against the stock, and I\u2019d like to keep investing and making sure, we\u2019re finding and continuing to build on growth.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">All right. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Erika Najarian</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Hi, good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Hey, good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Erika Najarian</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So because of your capital excess in both CET1 and SLR, your name keeps coming up as someone that can continue to take market share, particularly in ICG. And I\u2019m wondering if there are limitations on growth or balance sheet allocation that we\u2019re not thinking about. And I guess the real question here is, where are you in terms of your scoring range on your GCIB surcharge? And is keeping your surcharge where it is today a bigger priority than potentially growing the balance sheet in a greater way to gain market share, given how volatile that that score can be?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Great question, Erika. And one that we contemplate every day. There\u2019s a series of constraining factors that we constantly try to optimize against, GCIB score is one of them. LCR, CET1 stress test capital call that CCAR capital, there\u2019s just many and all those ratios on both an advanced approach basis as well as a standardized approach basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So it\u2019s a constant trade-off, but the GCIB is certainly one of those things that we look at when we\u2019re making decisions. And to your point, as was previously disclosed, we got into the 3% bucket last year we work to get there. And we ended the year now, I\u2019d say in the very high end of that score range.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And one of our goal is to remain in a 3% GCIB in a 3% bucket at year-end this year. And so, we\u2019re actively managing each of the many elements of the score in order to optimize the returns of the franchise. And you\u2019re right, those indicators can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, but it\u2019s something that we\u2019re trying to actively manage. When I look at the preliminary results that I have for our 630 GCIB score, we come out right at 630. So we\u2019re right in that range of where we need to be and we\u2019re going to keep on working to make sure that we end the year below that 630 target.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Erika Najarian</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Got it. And just a follow-up question on the margin appreciate the color that you gave in terms of the puts and takes of Costco for the next \u2013 for the second-half of the year. If the slope of the curve persists or there\u2019s continued pressure on the long end, how should we think about how the marginal progress from that 290 level?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">One more weighted especially short-term to the short end of the curve. What we\u2019ve told you in the past is, if the rates move by a 100 basis points, we\u2019ll generate an additional around the world of $1.9 billion of additional net interest income. And most of that $1.9 billion will be concentrated in the U.S. which is I think about a $1.4 billion. And most of that $1.4 billion is focused on the short end.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So the long end of the curve, especially in the near-term the next year, year-and-a-half doesn\u2019t really impact us all that much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Erika Najarian</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Got it. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. No problem.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ken Usdin</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Thanks a lot. John, we saw a progress this quarter in the efficiency ratio as you mentioned. And I was just wondering is the prior comments you had made about 58% in Corp for the year still relevant, given the trends that we\u2019ve seen, or is there anything that kind of coming out of the second quarter with the 57 that makes you feel any better about the second-half, I know there\u2019s some seasonality?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I feel pretty good about the second-half. But what we had said at the end of the first quarter is that our target would be to do 58% efficiency for the full-year, given what we \u2013 the given the first quarter results. And I\u2019d say that still is where our target is, is at or around that 58% efficiency ratio in Citicorp for the full-year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ken Usdin</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. And I know it\u2019s hard to talk about seasonality and given the flurry that we just had of activity in the markets business in June. But how would you characterize how we should think about quote, unquote seasonality or normal seasonality in the summer for the business. And do you \u2013 have you seen any change in activity as things have kind of calm down post the initial reaction of f Brexit?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">The \u2013 it\u2019s still very, very, very early in the third quarter. So it\u2019s a little hard to comment on activity for an entire quarter after just eight, nine trading days. But the activity levels are fine that I think it\u2019s good. And we\u2019ll have to see how everything holds up into the month of August, but again the beginning part of July looks fine.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ken Usdin</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Great. One last or one for me just in terms your NIM comments and then just that we know that Costco is going to full quarter in the third, it\u2019s a pretty good line of sight in terms of being able to grow NII from here?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I like the prospects of growing NII, I mean, obviously with Costco coming on, that gives us the big boost. I talked about the momentum that we got in for the consumer businesses in Asia and Latin America with branded cards.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So, yes, we \u2013 I don\u2019t have a prepared comment on guidance on NII. I don\u2019t like to give guidance on individual line items of the income. But, yes, we feel very good about the NII, and that\u2019s why we feel that the NIM should improve back up to the 290 or maybe a little higher range in the second-half of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ken Usdin</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay, understood. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Thanks. John, a couple of questions. The first is on Slide 28, where you have the ICG unfunded corporate energy exposure?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">The double and single B component looks like, it actually grew by close to $1 billion versus last quarter. And I\u2019m wondering, if that\u2019s from actual additional exposure or is that from the down \u2013 the ratings migration of existing exposures?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Well, and some of that is migration. There\u2019s a variety of factors that that go into that. But there\u2019s nothing in there that would indicate that there\u2019s something deteriorating, or anything else it\u2019s just a series of puts and takes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. And the \u2013 I think you previously indicated that 65% of the total of about $35 billion is either investment-grade or has credit support. Has that figure changed at all?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">No, I don\u2019t have that in front of me. So I apologize for that. We\u2019ll have to get back, yes. I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s any big deterioration there. I just don\u2019t have that with me.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay, great, no problem. And then just following up on sort of several of the questions and your responses, we think about the back-half of this year. It sounds like what you\u2019re pointing us towards is balance sheet expansion driving NII growth with perhaps a little bit of a lift also from NIM, continued positive operating leverage from lower repositioning costs and some improvement in the provision guidance, although still incremental build, but potentially some lesser degree of trading revenue. Is that broadly correct?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Well, I\u2019m not going to comment on what you might pull out of your own model. But in broad strokes I would be cautious about thinking that I\u2019ve guided you to balance sheet expansion. Balance sheet expansion is not really something that we\u2019re targeting. As I said, we still believe that we can optimize our balance sheet. So I wouldn\u2019t factor in undue expansion of the balance sheet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. Yes, I was sort of speaking of within Citicorp, but rather than broadly. But would Citicorp still be broadly low like, I mean, I think it was up about 1% in the period?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">The balance sheet growth?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I\u2019m not prepared to give forward guidance on the balance sheet. Let\u2019s just say that, again, from the overall level of about $1.8 trillion for the overall Citigroup, that\u2019s broadly the area that we still believe that we should be operating.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Great. Thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Hi, good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So, John, I had a quick question on CCAR, maybe a bit of a follow-up to Erika\u2019s earlier question. The results are priced very positively in the latest round. As you prepare for some of the tougher elements like GCIB surcharge inclusion, how are you thinking about the capital minimums or targets that you need to amass to day to day as part of your allocation process? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense as to whether this has changed significantly just given the favorable results that we saw in the latest stress test round?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Well, first of all, Steven, I wouldn\u2019t know what to do about GCIB surcharge in CCAR, because unless something happen this morning while I\u2019ve been sitting here we haven\u2019t seen any proposed rule yet. So that\u2019s something that we\u2019re obviously aware of the rhetoric that\u2019s out there. But, again, we just don\u2019t know, so that has not impacted our planning as yet at all.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay, got it. And I recognize, John, that you don\u2019t want to give explicit guidance on balance sheet growth expectations, but with the price of RWAs come down in the quarter and given the growth in both loans and assets, I\u2019m just trying to get a better handle as to what was driving that. I know that there\u2019s some FX translation impacts that could influence the moves in RWA. But given how much Holdings has shrunk, is it reasonable to assume that RWA growth will wrap Citicorp growth going forward in terms of\u2026?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Well, actually, if you \u2013 yes, Steven, if you look Holdings RWA declined by about $8 billion or $9 billion in the quarter. And if you look our RWA overall dropped by about $8 billion in the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Got it, okay. One more quick modeling question for me on legal and repositioning costs. You\u2019d guided to the 225 basis points for Citicorp for the full-year. It looks like there has been a higher run rate in those expenses in the first-half. What\u2019s a reasonable expectation for what we should be modeling for the second-half for legal and repositioning?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I would still say that for the full-year, the 225 is still a pretty good number.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Perfect. Thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O\u2019Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Well\u2026</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Hi, Matt.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O\u2019Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Just stepping back bigger picture, you\u2019ve done a lot of work in the credit card businesses, a lot of upfront investing, obviously renewal of some contracts, gaining some contracts. So there\u2019s still obviously the execution to do, but it seems like the heavy lifting has been done from an investment point of view. If you look at the rest of the franchise across the products and the markets, are there other areas that you want to focus on increasingly so on investment dollars, or do we start to see maybe some moderation in some of the spend?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">For the investment perspective, Matt, I think we remained largely consistent with the things that we talked about before. So we talked about equities and we talked about what we\u2019re trying to do there the combination of prime brokerage, the combination of cash derivative Delta One and investments in people balance sheet, et cetera. So those continue. Investments in our network and our cash management business in that investments in digital and our interface on the consumer side. So, again, things that we\u2019ve consistently spoken about those investments continue.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O\u2019Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And just how you think about?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I would describe it\u2019s outsized.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O\u2019Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. Is it fair, I mean, it feels like the credit card and some of it shows up in expenses and some of it\u2019s a contra-revenue. But it seems like that was a pretty big effort to get behind you. And are these other things more kind of in a run rate or business as usual?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I would say from a technology perspective, we probably need to think of a lot of those investments ongoing as business as usual. I think of the equities investment is probably being slightly different in terms of \u2013 there\u2019s a life to it and there\u2019s a set of expectations that we\u2019ve got to make sure we achieve out of those investments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I think, Matt, what you\u2019ll see is, we\u2019ll continue to invest where we have the prospects for growth. So you\u2019re likely to see still we\u2019ll have investment spending in Mexico, but that is captured in the guidance that I gave you as far as our belief of generating positive operating leverage in the second-half of this year and positive operating leverage in consumer in 2017, so that\u2019s embedded in that. We\u2019ll continue throughout U.S. to spend money to enhance our digital capabilities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So we do have investment dollars at play. So I don\u2019t want to tell you that, we\u2019re not going to be investing. Just to keep our TTS network in place, we spend hundreds of millions of dollars a year, that is not going to stop. But I think the spirit of Mike and I are trying to answer your questions, we don\u2019t see any large lumpy dollar where we\u2019re going to tell you that this is going to be some negative impact on our financial performance for the next several quarters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O\u2019Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. That\u2019s what I was getting at. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Hi, good afternoon.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Hi, Betsy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So a question just on capital creation, because clearly you are creating capital faster than earnings, thanks to things like Holdings shrinking and the DTA utilization and all that. And I\u2019m wondering, do you get any credit from the regulators for this in your opinion? And is there an opportunity, do you think at some point, maybe it\u2019s once we get through the CCAR buffer for GCIBs that\u2019s coming. But do you think there is a point when you\u2019ll be able to talk to them about the DTA utilization and the incremental capital from that going towards share repurchase as opposed to factoring into the whole CCAR process?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">When we think about capital generation and in particular capital returns, we don\u2019t as you reference think of that in terms of earnings, because we\u2019ve got the capacity and I think Slide 33 shows the drivers of capital and DTA that we\u2019ve got this ability through the utilization of DTA and again $10 billion used we since it peaked to generate regulatory capital at a kind of pretty significant rate.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So we understand that if we\u2019re not returning all of that excess capital and so if we measure ourselves, we measure ourselves against finding capital constraints, and today that would most likely be CCAR. What do we need to run the institution, what do we need is a buffer, and it\u2019s our intention over time to return all of that excess back to our shareholders that we can\u2019t use. And in this environment that\u2019s probably the bulk of earnings and DTA liberalization.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And when you think about the difference between our TCE and our CE Tier 1, it\u2019s largely the $29 billion of disallowed DTA. And so as we liberate that, we\u2019d like to return them. I think it\u2019s part of that conversation that\u2019s not nor will be a prospective conversation. But as we liberate it, we then want the ability to return that in arrears. And we\u2019ve been in conversations with our regulators about that and that will I think continue to show itself over time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So, I guess, is it \u2013 this upcoming rule that we\u2019re waiting for from the Fed regarding the GCIB buffer, GCIB surcharge increase for the folks like you that we\u2019re waiting for you get through that and then maybe the ask can go up? I\u2019m just wondering how you think about timing around that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">We\u2019ve consistently talked about walking the ask up. This year was a tripling of the dividend and meaningful increase in terms of buyback and it\u2019s our intention around the right operating environment and the right results to continue to do that. And again going back to the knowing that unless we do that and we return or use all of this excess capital, we\u2019re going to have a denominator problem. And so we\u2019re committed to doing that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question, just a couple one. First of all, John, in terms of the DTA utilization, you\u2019ve mentioned a couple of times on the call freeing up that asset. I guess, I\u2019m just curious why the pace of the DTA utilization was so much slower in the second quarter than the first quarter, given it looks like North American consumer profitability, pre-tax profitability was roughly similar quarter-over-quarter? And just looking through some of the ICG numbers, that it appears North American profitability there was also relatively similar quarter-over-quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Yes, Matt, if it was very simple to give you the formula as far as how you drive down the DTA, I\u2019d love to lay it out. But it just doesn\u2019t work that way. It has to do with certainly where the earnings are generated, importantly, how much of that is coming out of current taxes that that are due as opposed to how much you can put against your deferral.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So it\u2019s difficult to give you well if earnings are bit and the DTA will be back. There\u2019s just a lot of other things that go into it. But in general, again, we\u2019re focused on driving it down. And I think as Mike said, we\u2019re obviously been able to do that in billion dollars of utilization over the last couple of years. And we should be able to continue to utilize it somewhere in the range of $1.5 billion to $2 billion a year that\u2019s going to be the pace.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay. And then just moving on to page 24 of the supplement, I realize we\u2019re looking at end of period balances, so there may be something skewing this a little bit. But the corporate loans in EMEA grew in the second quarter at a much faster rate than you\u2019ve seen them grow year-over-year. I\u2019m curious if that\u2019s sort of a one-quarter blip possibly driven by Brexit, or are you really driving market share gains on the lending side, partly because of some of the challenges of the European banks?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yes, I don\u2019t have a great answer for you on that, Matt, I\u2019m sorry.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay. And then just finally, John, maybe following up on Betsy\u2019s question. Looking really at this CCAR cycle, you\u2019ve obviously had some good news in terms of living will, your CCAR proposal was accepted without any change. I guess, I\u2019m curious how you\u2019re thinking about potentially requesting a de minimis or a further increase in the buyback in this CCAR cycle using the de minimis exception?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yes, Matt, in that, I would say that it\u2019s still relatively early in the year, let\u2019s see how the year progresses and where we are and we\u2019ll make that judgment or that call later in the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay, thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Your next question comes from the line of Brian Klainhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Klainhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Hey, Brian.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Klainhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I had two questions. First on the Costco, you mentioned that the reserving would start in the back-half of this year, but do you get from the fair value marks, does that last you to third quarter? So you\u2019re not really going to see the reserving start until the fourth quarter, or does that start as early as the third quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">No, it actually started in the second quarter. But, again, we only had the portfolio for 13 days. But if you remember we kind of went through a similar set of discussions about LLR build when we acquired Best Buy back in 2013. And so as you correctly stated when we\u2019d purchase a loan portfolio, we acquired the receivables and they\u2019re recorded at fair value, so there\u2019s no corresponding loan loss reserve. Therefore, as new loans are originated, the LLR build.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">If you think about the difference between an acquired portfolio and a matured portfolio, in a matured portfolio that build would be offset by LLR releases for loans that actually paid off. However, if the acquired loans don\u2019t have an LLR, there\u2019s no offsetting releases as they pay down. So that means that your rate of build to a, let\u2019s call it normalized LLR for an acquired portfolio is actually depended on how fast the new loans are created, as well as how fast the old loans pay down.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">So if the pay down rate really has the predominant driver of the pace of the LLR build, as the portfolio gets replenished with new spend on existing cards. So since Costco has a high pay down rate, the LLR build on the Costco portfolio is going to be more front-loaded than with the case with Best Buy. So I actually think that what you\u2019re going to see in the third quarter could very well be the highest quarterly LLR build that we will see as a result of acquiring the portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Klainhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay, thanks. That was very helpful. And then also related to Costco on the purchase, obviously the intangibles went up. What\u2019s the life of those for the amortization schedule? Is it amortized over one year, two years?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I believe tangibles would tie back to the contract.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Klainhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay. And then just lastly, I guess going back to 2013, I mean, Mike you provided a nice update as to back in March of 2013 as to your long-term strategy of where you\u2019re going to be investing. Is there any plans to provide another one of those updates of the kind of benchmark what you\u2019ve done over the last three years, because there\u2019s a lot that\u2019s been done, but kind of what you are going to do to kind of drive the company forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yes, we plan on doing that. We haven\u2019t set a date in terms of coming out. But probably sometime over this summer or as we get to the end of the third quarter, we\u2019ll probably come out with some talk about when we\u2019re going to go up more broadly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Klainhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Great. Thanks so much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Thank you. Good afternoon, guys.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Hi, Gerard.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">John, you talked about how you had better than expected growth in the number of new cards from the Costco \u2013 new accounts from the Costco acquisition in these early days. Were the purchase sales as better than expected as the acquisition of the new accounts?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Purchase sales, I can say are running roughly in line with what we had anticipated, maybe a little bit higher, but roughly in line.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay. And the two-thirds outside of the store, is that in line with your expectations as well on the purchase sales?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">That\u2019s in line.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Yes. Is there anyway of taking this bigger with your global reach outside the U.S. than what maybe American Express could have done with Costco?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I\u2019m not prepared just to talk about. Let\u2019s absorb what we\u2019ve got right now first. Obviously, we\u2019re still working through the $11 billion portfolio that we have a 11 million new card members, let\u2019s give them a delightful experience first and then we\u2019ll think about international.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay. Clearly, you guys have made a commitment to cards with this acquisition and your other acquisitions. Are there any other portfolios that you are aware of that might come up for bidding in the next 12 or 18 months of meaningful size?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Of meaningful size. There is a couple intermediate size bites over the next few years, but there\u2019s nothing of any real significance. Obviously, like we have in the past, we\u2019ll continue to look at those, and if the numbers and returns work, we\u2019ll obviously compete for them, and if not we won\u2019t.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay. There\u2019s a lot of moving parts to this question. Obviously you guys are very well capitalized. The regulators control what you can give back in excess capital similar to your peers. Is there ever a thought of if you\u2019re limited and we won\u2019t know for a couple years that you can only give back what you earn every year and nothing above it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Is there a thought with your investments in the digital consumer capabilities that you are doing, that mobile channel to pursue a more aggressive consumer business in the United States, obviously you don\u2019t have a retail branch network and you probably don\u2019t need it in the future like some of your bigger peers. But is there any thought that you guys have, as your mobile channel is very robust, very strong, can you take that even bigger to grow that faster nationwide?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Well, I think we have that opportunity whether or not, we have the issue that you talked about. Again, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to end up with. But even if we are able to return all the capital that we think we have, I think we still have the opportunity to grow our consumer business in the U.S. as a result between digital and mobile. Those are things that we\u2019re definitely focused on.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay. Shifting gears on you, I know you talked about the ICG business and obviously what went on post Brexit with the trading. Was there any significant change in the pipeline in investment banking activity post Brexit? I know it\u2019s not that long ago. But anything there to talk about?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Well, I think the pipeline remains pretty strong. And actually on the heels of Brexit, we saw actually quite good deal flow. You saw debt capital markets, you saw equity capital markets, you saw M&amp;A getting executed getting announced. So I would say the pipeline for the third quarter remains pretty strong and provided we get reasonable markets. We\u2019ve got an environment in which we can continue to get these things done. So it feels pretty good.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And then just finally, your \u2013 obviously your credit quality has improved dramatically and it\u2019s still very strong. But there\u2019s always moving parts, and so one of the questions on the moving parts is, I think it was on the supplement package on page 33, you give us the breakout of your non-accrual loans in corporate and consumer. I notice you had some real good improvement in Latin America, they dropped quite a bit. But EMEA jumped up quite a bit in the quarter on non-accrual. Was that in energy-related credit or Brexit related credit or credits?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Two energy-related names in EMEA caused that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Okay, great. And look forward to see those, Mike, those new guidelines that you guys are going to hopefully announce later on. And just I would also throw an Investor Day now that you guys are moving forward, you might want to consider that for 2017, even though Susan is probably not happy about that. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">And we have no further questions in the queue at this time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Susan Kendall</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">All right.

Today's call will be hosted by Susan Kendall, Head of Citi Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions] Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Ms. Kendall, you may begin.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Susan Kendall</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you, Brian. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Mike Corbat will speak first, then John Gerspach, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we'll be happy to take questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results in capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2015 Form 10-K.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported earnings of $3.8 billion for the third quarter of 2016 or $1.24 per share. I have to say that I'm very encouraged by the underlying momentum across our franchise, notably in several areas where we've been investing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">In our Global Consumer Bank, we saw revenue increases in every business line and geography, excluding the impact of a one-time gain last year in Mexico. In the U.S., we realized the benefit of our first full quarter of the Costco portfolio, which is exceeding our expectations in every key metric. The remainder of our branded cards portfolio as well as retail services also delivered modest revenue growth as did our more focused retail branch network.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">In our institutional businesses, revenues increased 2%, as meaningful improvement in nearly every banking and markets product was partially offset by a swing in the mark-to-market value of loan hedges. Our Fixed Income franchise continued to benefit from strong client engagement across both our corporate and investor client base. And the backbone of our global network, Treasury and Trade Solutions, generated year-over-year revenue growth for the 11th consecutive quarter despite the low rate environment. In both our consumer and institutional businesses, we continued to grow both loans and deposits.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Consistent with our strategy, we continue to shift our resources to where they can generate the best returns for our investors. This can mean investments like Costco or divestments of certain businesses. For example, this month, we announced agreements to sell our retail banking operations in Argentina and Brazil and plans for significant investment in Mexico. As a sign of our commitment to Mexico, a market where we have real scale and confidence in its growth prospects, we're integrating the local brand with Citi's, and the franchise will be known as Citibanamex.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Turning toward our dwindling non-core assets. For the ninth quarter in a row, Citi Holdings was profitable, and its $74 million in net income was less than 2% of Citigroup's total earnings for the quarter. Assets in Citi Holdings are now only 3% of our balance sheet and down 48% from one year ago. As you know, the next quarter will be the last that we report holdings results separately.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We remain intensely focused on shareholder returns. This was the first quarter we began implementing our new capital plan. During the quarter, we reduced our outstanding common shares by 56 million. The amount of outstanding is 2% lower from the prior quarter and 4% down from one year ago. That acceleration in the reduction of the amount of outstanding shares is due to the increased amount of buybacks under the capital plan.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In the past two years, we've lowered the amount of outstanding common shares by 180 million or 6%. Our tangible book value per share increased to $64.71 in the quarter, which is an 8% increase from one year ago, reflecting the impact of the stock repurchases and our efforts to deliver quality and consistent earnings. Even so, our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio increased to 12.6%, and we're committed to continue increasing the capital we return to our shareholders in order to improve our returns.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Looking forward, while we expect growth both in the developed and emerging markets to pick up next year, the uncertainties that color the current economic environment haven't retreated. Brexit, hard, soft or scrambled, is still an open question and is likely to remain so for the near future. Here in the U.S., thankfully, we're only a few weeks away from the presidential election, and there seems to be growing consensus for interest rate increases, but the Fed has clearly been dovish up to this point. Economic projections have improved somewhat recently, particularly in places like Brazil and Russia, which may soon return to positive growth.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">John will now go through our presentation, and then we'd be happy to take your questions. John?</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Thank you, Mike and good morning, everyone. Starting on slide three, we show total Citigroup results. Revenues of $17.8 billion declined 4% from last year, and expenses decreased 2%, each driven primarily by the continued wind-down of Citi Holdings as well as the impact of foreign exchange translations. And credit costs improved, reflecting a reduction in the provision for benefits and claims due to asset sales in Citi Holdings as well as lower net credit losses, partially offset by a net reserve build this quarter as compared to a small release in the prior year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Net income of $3.8 billion declined 8% from last year, mostly driven by mark-to-market loan hedges and the absence of one-time gains in the prior period. However, we were able to offset some of this impact through underlying business growth. We also benefited from share buybacks, which drove a 4% decline in our average diluted shares outstanding. In constant dollars, Citigroup end of period loans grew 3% year-over-year to $638 billion and 7% growth in Citicorp was partially offset by the continued wind-down of Citi Holdings, and deposits grew 4% to $940 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">On slide four, we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Citicorp was again the predominant driver of profitability in the third quarter, contributing 98% of total net income. Pre-tax earnings of $5.6 billion in Citicorp declined by roughly $300 million year-over-year. However, this comparison includes losses on mark-to-market loan hedges this quarter as compared to gains in the prior year as well as certain previously disclosed one-time items that benefited the third quarter of 2015, including a gain on the sale of our merchant-acquiring business in Mexico and the reversal of valuation adjustment in our equities business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Together, these items drove a roughly $900 million negative variance in the year-over-year EBIT comparison, all of which was reflected in revenues. Excluding these items, Citicorp revenues would have grown 6% year-over-year, with broad-based growth across our institutional and consumer businesses, partially offset by lower revenues in Corp/Other.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Citicorp expenses grew 3%, mostly reflecting volume growth as well as continued investments in the franchise, partially offset by efficiency savings. And cost of credit grew 8% from the third quarter of last year, driven by a larger reserve build. Most of the reserve build related to our U.S. Cards franchise, driven by the Costco portfolio acquisition, volume growth and the estimated impact of newly proposed regulatory guidelines on third-party collections, which I'll describe more in a moment. Credit quality remained broadly favorable across the franchise, with stable to improving loss rates in every region.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to Citi Holdings. Both revenues and expenses declined significantly year-over-year as we continue to wind down the portfolio. We reduced Citi Holdings assets by nearly half over the past year, ending the third quarter with $61 billion of assets, and we have signed agreements in place to reduce this amount by an additional $10 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning now to each business. Slide five shows the results for North America Consumer Banking. Total revenues grew 7% year-over-year. Retail banking revenues of $1.4 billion grew 2% from last year on continued growth in average loans and checking deposits of 9% and 10%, respectively. We generated this volume growth even as our branch footprint continued to shrink. We have spent the last several years reshaping our branch network, upgrading technology and deepening our focus on our core six markets, enabling us to grow revenues while reducing expenses and significantly improving the profitability of our retail bank.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">And now with the right footprint and infrastructure in place, we are beginning to invest for additional growth by enhancing our segmentation strategy focused on the Citigold wealth management platform, improving our digital and mobile banking capabilities and continuing to upgrade the network with smart branches and dedicated Citigold centers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to branded cards. Revenues of $2.2 billion grew 15%, reflecting the first full quarter of contribution from the Costco portfolio as well as modest organic growth. Excluding Costco, we generated 1% underlying revenue growth as we are beginning to lap the investment program we started last year and a portion of the new balances are maturing to full rate.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to Costco. The early results continue to be very encouraging. New account acquisitions have far exceeded our expectations at nearly 800,000 to date. Purchase sales have totaled roughly $28 billion to date, with over 70% being out of store, indicating that customers are using this card first for their everyday purchases. And the loan portfolio had grown to over $14 billion as of the end of the third quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Finally, retail service revenues of $1.6 billion improved 1% from last year. We saw better-than-expected average loan growth in retail services this quarter, up 2% sequentially, which offset the absence of two portfolios we sold in the first quarter as well as the impact of renewing and extending several partnerships.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Total expenses for North America consumer were $2.6 billion, up 12% from last year, mostly reflecting the Costco portfolio acquisition, volume growth and continued marketing investments. Costco-related expenses were somewhat elevated this quarter as we addressed higher-than-anticipated service volumes in the weeks following the conversion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">And finally, credit costs in North America increased significantly from last year. Net credit losses increased 6% to $929 million, driven by volume growth. And we\u2019ve built over $400 million of net loan loss reserves during the quarter, including nearly $450 million in branded cards and retail services. Roughly a third of this amount was related to the acquisition of the Costco portfolio as we previously described. Another third was related to volume growth in normal seasoning in the portfolios. And the remaining third predominantly reflected the estimated impact of newly proposed regulatory guidelines on third-party collections.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In branded cards, the NCL rate declined to 225 basis points this quarter, reflecting the addition of the Costco portfolio, which did not incur any losses during the quarter as we had generally excluded late-stage delinquencies from the acquired loans. Excluding Costco, the NCL rate in branded cards has been in the range of roughly 280 basis points year-to-date. We expect the loss rate on Costco to be lower than the existing portfolio, but this benefit will likely be offset by the impact of seasoning as well as the estimated impact of the proposed regulatory guidelines I just mentioned. So we expect the NCL rate to remain in the range of around 280 basis points next year with some quarterly variability.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In retail services, the loss rate has been in the range of around 410 basis points year-to-date, and we expect it to increase to around 435 basis points next year, again, primarily reflecting the impact of seasoning and the proposed regulatory guidelines. Importantly, these NCL rates are consistent with our return goals for each business, with branded cards targeting at least 225 basis points of ROA and retail services in the range of around 250 basis points.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On slide six, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. In total, excluding the impact of a one-time gain on the sale of our merchant-acquiring business in Mexico last year, revenues grew 4% and expenses were flat to last year. In Latin America, excluding the prior year gain, consumer revenues were up 5% as continued growth in retail banking, which grew 11% year-over-year, was offset by a decline in cards. These retail banking results reflect strong volume growth, with average loans and deposits increasing 8% and 12% respectively. Latin America cards revenues declined from last year. However, we continue to see signs of recovery in that business this quarter, which I'll cover more in a moment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">And finally, expenses were flat year-over-year in Latin America, resulting in significant positive operating leverage. As Mike mentioned earlier, we are continuing to invest in our Mexico consumer franchise to drive sustainable growth, with initiatives to enhance our branch network, digital capabilities and service offerings. We expect to maintain positive operating leverage next quarter and each year throughout the investment period, driven by revenue growth as well as cost savings from upgrading and standardizing our technology platforms.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to Asia. Consumer revenues grew 3% year-over-year, driven by improvement in Wealth Management and cards, partially offset by the continued repositioning of our retail loan portfolio. Wealth Management revenues grew 11% from last year on improving investor sentiment and continued positive AUM inflows. And cards turned positive as well with revenues up 4%, driven by modest volume growth, a continued improvement in yields and abating regulatory headwinds. Retail lending revenues remained under pressure as we continued to shift our portfolio away from lower-return mortgage loans this quarter. While this shift drove a modest decline in average retail loans and lending revenues, our goal is to build a higher-return, more balanced portfolio over time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">And finally, total credit costs grew 13% in our international consumer franchise, reflecting a modest reserve build this quarter compared to our release in the prior year, while loss rates remained favorable.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On slide seven, we show some key performance indicators for our global branded cards franchise, including year-over-year growth in purchase sales, average card loans and revenues. In North America, as you can see, these trends show a significant positive impact from the Costco portfolio acquisition. But even excluding that transaction, we continue to show progress in our existing franchise with organic growth in purchase sales, average loans and revenues this quarter. As I just noted, in Asia, we have also achieved revenue growth year-over-year, which we expect to continue going forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">And finally, in Latin America, we achieved growth in both purchase sales and average loans this quarter, but revenues remained down 6% versus last year. This year-over-year comparison was affected by certain episodic fee revenues in the prior period.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On a comparable basis, card revenues in Latin America would have been down 3% versus last year, reflecting the continued impact of higher payment rates. With continued growth in purchase sales and average loans, we expect Latin America card revenues to return to sustainable growth in the second half of next year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Slide eight shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail across both cards and retail banking. Credit remained broadly favorable again this quarter in every region. The decline in the NCL rate in North America mostly reflects the impact of the Costco portfolio, which, as I mentioned earlier, did not incur any losses this quarter. Excluding Costco, the NCL rate would have been flat to the prior year at 2.2%. And the NCL rate in Latin America showed particular improvement as well. However, as our loan portfolio continues to grow in season, we still expect this NCL rate to run closer to 4.5% as we go into next year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On slide nine, we show the year-over-year EBIT walk for consumer for the third quarter. When we presented this slide last quarter, our first half EBIT comparison was affected by several factors, including the comparison to much stronger prior year periods in wealth management, the early stage of our organic cards investments, the expenses we were absorbing on Costco before we had the full benefit of the revenues on that portfolio and the impact of significant repositioning charges in the first quarter of this year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Now in the third quarter, you can see that we're beginning to build momentum again. We generated business growth in areas like Asia and North America cards as well as the retail and commercial businesses in both North America and Latin America. We are beginning to lap the impact of our branded cards investments on rebate and rewards costs and saw a full-quarter benefit from the acquisition of the Costco portfolio. And Wealth Management revenues continue to recover with improving investor sentiment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">In total, we generated 5% underlying revenue growth in our consumer franchise this quarter. And while expenses were up as well by 7%, we still grew our operating margin by roughly $150 million year-over-year, and we believe we can operate closer to flat operating leverage in the fourth quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Of course, we faced credit headwind this quarter as we built loan loss reserves compared to our release in the prior year. However, some of the current quarter reserve builds were related to Costco and the proposed regulatory guidelines I mentioned earlier and shouldn't recur at these levels. So overall, while we still face some headwinds, we feel good about the direction of the consumer franchise.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on slide 10. Revenues of $8.6 billion in the third quarter grew 2% from last year, driven by Fixed Income, Investment Banking and Treasury and Trade Solutions. Total banking revenues of $4.3 billion grew 7% from last year. Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2 billion grew 8% in constant dollars, driven by continued growth in transaction volumes with new and existing clients. The TTS business remains core to our institutional strategy, delivering integrated solutions to our multinational clients and deepening our operating relationships with them across multiple products and markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Investment Banking revenues of $1.1 billion grew 15% from last year on strong debt underwriting activity, partially offset by lower equity underwriting revenues. Private Bank revenues of $746 million were up 4% year-over-year, driven by loan growth, improved spreads and higher managed investment revenues. And Corporate Lending revenues of $450 million also grew 4%, mostly reflecting higher average loans. Total Markets and Securities Services revenues of $4.5 billion grew 11% from last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Fixed Income revenues of $3.5 billion were up 35%, with both rates and currencies and spread products contributing to revenue growth. Rates and currencies grew over 30% year-over-year, with particular strength in G10 Rates, reflecting strong client activity in a more favorable environment. And spread product revenues grew over 40% as credit and securitized markets continued to recover from the depressed levels we saw in late 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Turning to equities. Excluding a positive valuation adjustment in the prior year of approximately $140 million, our revenues were down 23% year-over-year, driven by lower client activity and a less favorable environment, particularly in derivatives as well as the comparison to a strong quarter in Asia last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Finally, in Securities Services, revenues grew 4% year-over-year as increased client activity, higher deposit volumes and improved spreads more than offset the impact of divestitures. Total operating expenses of $4.7 billion were down 1% year-over-year, driven by efficiency savings, lower legal costs and a benefit from FX translation. On a trailing 12-month basis, excluding the impact of severance, our comp ratio remained at 27%. Cost of credit was a benefit of $90 million in the third quarter as net credit losses were largely offset by previously existing reserves and we also saw a net benefit from ratings upgrades, reductions in exposures and improved valuations.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On slide 11, we show the year-over-year EBIT walk for ICG on a year-to-date basis, which shows continued significant improvement from the start of the year. Given the strong revenue performance this quarter, we're now showing 2% growth on a year-to-date basis in our accrual and transaction services businesses as well as markets and banking. And we were able to achieve this growth while maintaining our operating discipline, with expenses up just 1% even while we continue to invest in the franchise. The most significant year-over-year drag comes from other revenue items, including the impact of the Venezuela devaluation in the first quarter as well as mark-to-mark losses on loan hedges, driven by spread movements.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">As part of our ongoing risk management efforts, we use loan hedges to manage our credit risk concentrations using predominately single main CDS positions against specific exposures in our portfolio. While these positions provide an economic hedge and help us manage concentrations to any particular client, sector or region, they are accounted for on a mark-to-market basis. And this year, we've seen consistent spread tightening in these positions driving mark-to-market losses in comparison to the spread widening we experienced last year, which drove significant gains.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Slide 12 shows the results for Corporate/Other. Revenues decreased year-over-year largely due to the absence of the contribution from our equity stake in China Guangfa Bank, which we sold this quarter. And expenses increased, mostly reflecting our sponsorship of the U.S. Olympic team this year as well as higher consulting cost related to the timing of the resolution plan submissions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On Slide 13, we show Citigroup's net interest revenue and margin trends. The bars represent net interest revenue per day for each quarter in constant dollars, showing consistent growth year-over-year in Citicorp while Citi Holdings has continued to shrink. Our net interest margin was 286 basis points this quarter, lower than our previous outlook of around 290 basis points as the benefit from Costco and other loan growth was offset by lower trading NIM and higher-than-anticipated cash balances during the quarter as we supported client activity. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect NIM to remain relatively flat to this level.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On Slide 14, we show our key capital metrics. During the quarter, our CET1 capital ratio increased to 12.6%. Our supplementary leverage ratio was 7.4%, and our tangible book value per share grew by 8% year-over-year to $64.71, in part driven by a 4% reduction in our shares outstanding.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Before I turn it over to questions, let me make a few comments on our outlook for the fourth quarter. In consumer, we expect to continue to generate year-over-year revenue growth in constant dollars across North America, Asia and Latin America, although, sequentially, mortgage activity could be seasonally slower versus the third quarter. In the institutional franchise, we expect markets to reflect a normal seasonal decline from the third quarter, but revenues still should improve year-over-year. And Investment Banking revenue should be broadly stable sequentially, assuming that market conditions remain favorable. In Corporate/Other, revenue should continue to run close to 0.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Turning to expenses. We expect core expenses in Citicorp to be down modestly from the third quarter, reflecting the absence of certain episodic costs, lower compensation expense and other efficiency savings, partially offset by seasonally higher marketing expenses and ongoing investment spend. And cost of credit in Citicorp should be higher than the third quarter, assuming that credit costs in ICG normalize versus the benefit we saw this quarter. In consumer, the LLR build should be lower in the fourth quarter. However, we also expect NCLs to be higher as the Costco portfolio begins to incur losses and we continue to see the impact of volume growth. Finally, we expect Citi Holdings to operate around breakeven.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And with that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p7\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Hi. Thanks very much. First and foremost, a big-picture question. I think you showed a lot of progress in turning around growth in both international consumer and cards, keeping expenses flat, credits fine, shrinking the share count, all the good stuff. So when I look at slide 19, I want help in your words interpreting it. At Citigroup, the return on tangible is not where you want it to be, not earnings, the cost of capital. Excluding the disallowed DTA, it's a lot closer at 9.2%. When you look at GCB and ICG, they're even better. So I guess, I'm curious on how you evaluate where profitability is and where it should be. Not sure you're ready to roll out goals for next year yet, but just any guidance there would be great.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach <br></span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So, I mean, Glenn, this is a perfectly fair question. What you see in Corp/Other, I think we laid this out in some of the slides we used at the Financial Services Conference early in September. We recognized that we've got a lot of capital sitting there in Corp/Other. Some of it is capital we're holding above what we would say is our target capital. And again, we're waiting to see where the whole CCAR process and the various rules as far as Basel III enhanced or Basel IV come out, but we recognize our debt capital there. And that's also where you got the DTA capital that we backed out at the bottom.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So there is improvement clearly that we intend to drive in GCB. We still have the target there of 20%. ICG is closer to where we had set the longer-term goal of 14%, and we still have a ways to go in getting that 9.2% up to that overall target of 14% that we set out. A good piece of that will come from continued business growth and continued expense efficiencies. A small bit will come as we continue to wind down holdings, and the rest of it will come as we continue to increase the amount of capital that we're able to return to our shareholders.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Fair enough. Two small ones to follow up. Specifically, on the loan hedges in ICG, will they -- are they always going to be offsetting the positives? In other words, is that how the hedges will work? And we'll just have to deal with the negative line when things are going well? And then on securitized products that were up 40%, what specific products are there? And does it feel sustainable for now in your opinion?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach <br></span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Let me tackle the first question as far as -- what was the first question on the loan hedge? [indiscernible] Glenn, sorry. Just kidding, just kidding. I think that what we've seen in the last two years, but really, in the third quarter in each of the years, is an outsized movement in credit spreads. And that's really been reflecting in those loan hedges. The results that we're getting on those loan hedges, the large gain in last third quarter and the heavier losses now that we've taken in the second and the third quarter, I think that's more reflective of a wider spread, larger spread movement, then this is the way it's always going to be. Because we've had these hedges, these types of hedges on in the past. And you haven't seen -- you've seen some variability, but the volatility that we've seen in each of the last two years, I just think is a bit outsized. So I don't think -- I can't tell you when it's going to stop, but that's not something that I think that's going to be -- carry with us into the future.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat <br></span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And Glenn, on the spread products side of things, I think what you've seen here is the years progressed and we moved more towards a more likely shift towards higher rates. I think you've seen a relatively strong calendar on the debt issuance side, which always helps fuel secondary activity, and I think people are now focusing on positioning or repositioning their credit portfolios for an environment in the U.S. of higher rates. So again, we've beaten spread products down. There's some pretty low volumes and some pretty low numbers. So it's our expectation that, again, around a backdrop of a path towards slowly increasing rates and repositioning the portfolios, volumes continue to work their way back up. We don't see any big spike back up, but we expect it to continue to work its way back up.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">All right. Thanks very much for that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thanks, Glenn.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hi. Good morning. Bigger picture question on cards, guys. It's nice to see the traction on the card metrics from the investments in terms of account growth, loans and revenues. Look like they're picking up now. But as you said, you've also got this upfront investment and provisioning that you're doing. I guess, bigger picture, where are you in terms of this investment cycle in cards? And where do you see maybe an inflection point with the profits, net profits begin growing and the ROA gets closer to that targeted range that you have?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yes, it's a fair question, John. So we mentioned the fact that now we're beginning to lap some of the investment activity to grow the organic portfolio. When we brought on Costco, we said that just given the purchase accounting, Costco will not be really accretive to our earnings until sometime in the latter part of '17. It's going to take at least a full year to really get there before it gets accretive just because of the way the loan loss reserve mechanics come. So I'd say that we're at a point now in cards, it may stabilize. It may be, from a return point of view, be slightly down again in '17. But then I would expect it to begin to tick up. I can't give you the exact timing, John, but it's sometime either in late '17 or certainly in '18. And then throughout '19, we should see a steady drive towards increased profitability coming out of the cards business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And John, if you look at the three, in essence, things that we've been working. Again, as John mentioned, overcoming some of the regulatory headwinds that were there. We've also talked about having a number of or really all of our important renegotiations behind us, and so that's now done. And the third piece is that we've got our products in place. We've got our cash back in place. We've got our global rewards program in place, and we've built and put those out there. And now it's really supporting and driving growth, and a lot of what you've seen is now turning toward is the increase in terms of marketing and really trying to drive volume towards and client acquisition towards those cards. And that's probably the spending that you continue to see from this point forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up, a separate question on CCAR. Just wanted to get your thoughts on the recent proposed tweaks in CCAR. As you've discussed, John, unlocking the value trapped by DTA requires you to eventually start returning more capital than you're generating. Do you have any increased clarity or confidence after CCAR last year and then the tweaks proposed this year that you can accelerate payouts to a level of net reduction in the next year or two?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So John, I'd say that everything that you saw come out from Governor Tarullo's speech, there's nothing in that speech that is inconsistent with what we want to drive towards. So we don't see any reason to think that we can't eventually get there. I think that the question is timing. And as we've said, that's something that we'll consider each year as we go through our CCAR process. You've seen us have significant increases in that capital return over the last two cycles. And that's our goal, is to continue to increase that capital return, as I think Mike said in his opening remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. But in terms of the timing, there's still some uncertainty in terms of what kind of pace that we could expect over the next year or two?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yes, I think you have to be somewhat cautious in that. We haven't seen -- we heard the speech and the tweaks. Clearly, what Governor Tarullo laid down in that speech, I would say, are manageable. There's an NPR that is going to be published early next year. I'd like to read that NPR before I made any comments, and I certainly would like to see what scenario we're going to be looking at in next year's CCAR test. So there's a few things that, I think, Mike and I would like to be able to work our way through before we gave you a specific answer on that question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Hey. Good morning, guys. Maybe on the card business. You guys, I think, had 5% quarter-over-quarter growth in period balances. So obviously still very good momentum. Can you help us think about, was that a big flurry upfront and it's starting to slow? Or you're seeing that momentum continue? How do we think about how we think about the next quarter or two in terms of the pace of new signups?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Well, when you take a look -- don't forget, there was a lot of pent-up demand in Costco as far as for new account acquisition. And clearly, with Costco not issuing cards for 6 or 7 months, we've certainly captured that. I have to admit, we've been favorably, nicely surprised by the way that the Costco portfolio has grown. We bought that -- when we took that portfolio on, it was -- it came on our books at $10.6 billion. When we reported second quarter and the first 10 days, it had grown to $11.3 billion, and now it's looking at something in excess of $14 billion. So we benefited from very strong growth in the Costco portfolio. I don't think that I'd want to say that we can expect to have that type of sequential growth out into the future, but we'd still expect that portfolio to yield very good results. And as Mike and I have both said, the portfolio performance so far, the relationship with Costco, the overall relationship is just exceeding our expectations.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So would you say that in terms of the long-term accretion, obviously, the next few quarters, you won't see it. But long term, has it increased your expectation around accretion?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I'd say that it gives us greater confidence in pointing towards that ROA target of 225-plus basis points.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. Fair. And then one last question on expenses. You gave guidance for next quarter, but as we think about next year, all the puts and takes to sort of the investment spending in Mexico, continued investment spend in retail and cards, how do we think about overall? Can you still kind of get efficiency savings to kind of fund a lot of that and keep expenses reasonably flat? Or how do we think about that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Well, I don't want to commit to flat expenses yet for '17. We're going through our budget process now. I think we'll have a little bit more to say about '17 guidance when we report fourth quarter earnings. But again, we're not looking at a large-scale investment program going into next year. But there are investments that we want to make, and we think that they're important. But I -- we're not going to surprise you with some incredible amount of operating expense growth, but I'm not willing to commit to flat operating expenses at this point in time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">That's fair. But do you think it's on the repositioning and restructuring charges, legal charges? I think we're at 500 basis points year-to-date. You guys have been targeting 200. Do we start to see some at least the repositioning stuff come down?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I don't think I'm surprised that we're at -- that's not a number that --</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Maybe I'm doing the math wrong. I think that's what I calculated.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes. I don't think so. It's in the higher 200 at this point in time. And we'll likely -- what we said that we thought that we'd be at somewhere around 200 basis points, which is kind of where we were last year. This year, given the first quarter revenues, where they were, it's likely to be a little bit higher, maybe 225. Again, I don't want to say that we're going to stay in that 200 to 225 range next year, but I certainly don't see it growing to 500 basis points, Jim. No.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Right. I think I was doing it as a percentage of expenses. My apologies.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">That\u2019s okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Hi. Good afternoon. So John, in the media call, you had indicated that the equities business could increase its ranking to number 5 or number 6 globally, which, from what I can gather, implies about $3.5 billion to $4 billion of revenues versus the current run rate of about $2.8 billion. I was hoping you could speak to how you plan on closing the gap. Does it require additional investments from here as we think about the expense outlook going forward? Or can you close the gap with the current personnel and resources that you have in place right now?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Steven, it's Mike. The numbers, I would say, as we look at kind of where we are, which is in 8, 9 position going, as John described, to 5 6 is, it varies a bit by quarter and will vary a bit based on some of the volumes. We're at about $250 million of revenue per quarter, so theoretically, about $1 billion of revenue a year. We feel that the investments that we've talked about in the investment -- in the equities business are largely done and primarily focused on really two key areas, one is an investment in terms of technology, which is critical, certainly to the future of the equities business and second, it's coming out of a resizing, rescaling that we've gone through in our equities business of making sure we've got the right people in the right positions and being out there and getting talent, both internally and externally, into the right seats.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And I would describe that as largely done. So really, from here, it's up to us and up to our team to execute. I would say, and I don't put this out there as an excuse, but I think it is a reality that in a very challenged volume market, it's tough to take share. So we're getting the right signals in terms of some of the early KPIs around broker votes, around some of the feedback of some of the services that come back and tell you your ranking. We just haven't seen that yet translating or manifesting itself into significant changes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">But I think you saw us a while back say we were going to do this in the investment bank, and we made improvements there. We said we were going to do this in the private bank, and we've made improvements there. And so this is one of those things. We're going to hold ourselves to our commitment to deliver. Our people are certainly committed around that. And obviously, it'd probably, in this kind of environment, just take a little bit of time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thanks, Mike. I really do appreciate all the color there. And switching gears for a moment, just moving on to the capital side. I recognize some reluctance to speak to -- speak about a proposal that is not yet official. But based on some of the guidance that have been given with this new SEB calculation, I was hoping you could clarify, based on the latest CCAR results, where you think that minimum ultimately shakes out. And then given the volatility in CCAR results year-to-year, how you're thinking about the additional cushion you might want to maintain above any designated minimum.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Steven, I think that most of the analysts that published kind of captured where the SEB would turn out for us. I think most of the estimates call it less around an SEB of 270 basis points against a CCB of 250. And that's pretty much where we would put the number as well. We have not yet begun to really contemplate exactly how much cushion we need around that because, again, haven't seen the final NPR. So it's a little bit hard to talk about cushion against the speech. I'd just assume to see the rules before we actually get into public discussion about whether or not we need cushion. We also need to -- if this is the way it's going to be, you need then to also reassess just how variable those results are. So we'll look at all of those things. As I said, our initial view, based upon Governor Tarullo's speech, is that the proposal that he put forward seems to be manageable from our perspective.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">All right. Thanks, John. And then just one more quick one for me on looking at the capital denominators, it looks like your leverage exposure actually increased quarter-on-quarter even as assets and RWAs are flat. And given the strength in your SLR ratios, I know you've spoken to this in the past, where you're well above designated minimums and some of your European competitors might be more constrained. Are you seeing opportunities to deploy some of that additional balance sheet towards SLR-intensive opportunities maybe on the derivatives side specifically?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes, I wouldn't say it's focused so much on the derivatives side, but obviously, we've put some of our balance sheet capacity to work in areas like prime brokerage just to build it right back into your initial question as far as equities, where we're clearly putting more balance sheet to work there. And in this quarter, we had a little bit more, I think, increase in some of the off-balance sheet things, a few more commitments, et cetera, et cetera, but nothing staggering. And again, at 7 4, I think the word robust might even be an understatement. So --</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I would agree, John. Well, thank you for taking my questions. Appreciate it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Not a problem, Steven.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Hi. I have two questions that relate to the trade-off between results today and results in the future. And the first relates to operating leverage, which this year is negative 400 basis points according to your slide three. That would be for both Citigroup and Citicorp. On the other hand, the linked quarter progress is decent. So I'm trying to figure out how you manage that trade-off between maybe a little less investment spend a day for better earnings versus you want it to protect the future. And I think, what I heard you say is you're in the late innings for the card investments but in the early innings for additional Mexican investments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes, Mike, that is clearly a trade-off that we're constantly balancing. And we said going into the year that this year, because of the cards investment and the fact that the cards investments impact us both on a revenue as well as expense line, it was going to be particularly challenging this year from an operating leverage point of view. We're now -- you're now seeing the momentum come through. And again, we believe that we're going to continue to be able to share that momentum in the cards business. We've got the positive operating leverage now in our Asia consumer business and in our Mexico consumer business. And even though, certainly, in Mexico, this is two quarters in a row now of positive operating leverage.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">We've said that we intend to have positive operating leverage in Mexico in the fourth quarter. And then on a going-forward basis, the way we're looking at it right now, even with the investment spend that we want to do, we do believe that we'll be able to generate positive operating leverage in our Mexico consumer business in the next couple of years. Now I can only say that on an annual basis, I don't think anybody commit to quarterly operating leverage. There's always one or two things that happen. But our target next year is to produce positive operating leverage for the full year in Mexico.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And Mike, on each of those, I would add to what John said. We talked about it in cards. We haven't necessary talked about it the same way in Mexico, but it holds true, that a lot of the cards spend we needed to do was catch-up, that we were in a position or weren't in a position through the crisis to be making those investments that we probably wanted to or need to, to be competitive in the U.S. And you've seen us do that. Now I would say the same largely holds true for Mexico. If you look at some of our Mexican competitors, whether they're Mexican-owned or owned by other national banks, nationalistic banks, I would argue that we've under invested in that franchise, and some of this is really catch-up. And to the latter part of your question or statement, I don't think we're necessarily forecasting that there's a lot more that we need to do from here. We think that the $1 billion over the next four years, primarily focused on technology, branches, ATMs, puts us back in a competitive position.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So do you think that Citigroup will show positive operating leverage in 2017?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Mike, let us work through the budget, and then we'll talk to you when we announce fourth quarter earnings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And then the second question relating to the trade-off between today and the future. I know you don't like having a 7.8% ROTCE or 9.2% as you show on slide 19. What about accelerating the realization of some of those disallowed DTAs by selling appreciated assets such as Mexico? I mean, one choice is to invest in Mexico. Another choice is to sell Mexico, get the gain, redeploy the proceeds and the buyback, get the certain benefit today as opposed to less certain benefit down the road.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I think you framed it well in terms of today versus the future, and we remain consistently constructive in terms of Mexico at the broad level as well as our franchise in Mexico. And in a world, certainly, for my opinion, that we're growth in topline growth is going to remain tough, positions like that are to be treated well. And so we look at the intermediate to longer term prospects of our earnings and capital generation capacity or capability in Mexico as being very accretive to our shareholders. And as you've seen, we've got plenty of opportunity through our earnings and through the other things we're doing DTA and other to generate significant amounts of capital and to continue to address the denominator problem that we have in terms of continuing to take share count out.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">All right. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ken Usdin</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Good morning. Thanks. I was wondering if you could just walk us through a little bit of just kind of your underlying outlook for credit outside of the comments you've made about the card normalization and just the ratios that are going to move upward as the book start to season. Can you just give us some color just maybe North America versus rest of the world? Any signals whatsoever of credit normalization? Any pockets of weakness? You did mention some GDP strengthening in a couple of specific markets. But just how does credit feel to you as you look forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Right now, credit feels pretty good, I have to admit. We don't see -- again, we think that rates may inch up a little bit next year, but again, we're not seeing anything that would suggest some change in the cycle at this point in time. Part of that is, again, we're focused on a very specific target client, and so we don't exactly have this broad mass-market approach in most of our businesses, which might insulate us a little bit. But at this point in time, with the underwriting practices we have in place, we feel really good about credit in North America, in Latin America, in Asia.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ken Usdin</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay, great. And then just on the ICG side, as far as just the business growth, loans have been certainly growing. A couple of peers are growing faster, but you have that non-U.S. business. So can you just talk about demand for credit and where you sit in terms of willingness to continue to push that directionally as well as you continue to grow treasury and trade and the other parts of ICG?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yes. I think the way, Ken, that you characterized it there is probably appropriate in that loan demand is reasonable. But again, as we think about the extension of loans, we're facilitating a client relationship with the extension of that loan. And so as our clients need to expand and grow around the world, we're there to support them. And so as you look at a business model that supports largely Fortune 500, Fortune 5000 types of companies, and you look at global growth rates in the world, I think that the growth rates we're posting there make sense. And I think within the scheme of the environments are prudent and reasonable. And I would expect to continue to see, all things considered, similar types of growth rates into next year. If you look at the world next year, growth rates globally coming up a bit with probably parts of the emerging markets rebounding better or faster than parts of the developed economies. And I would expect loan growth to largely mimic that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ken Usdin</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. Got it. Thank you, Mike</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Erika Najarian</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yes. Just a follow-up for me. John, you mentioned in the last call that the restriction in terms of taking market share or the capital restriction that we should think about is the GSIB surcharge. And in light of the continued market share opportunities and your efforts in the equities business, is there natural RWA roll-off that can continue to fund balance sheet allocation higher in ICG rather than taking it from something else that's revenue generating? I don't know if I quite articulated that question well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Well, I -- the way I'm interpreting the question is does our focus on managing to a 3% GSIB surcharge, is that going to impact our ability to seize opportunities?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Erika Najarian</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yes, and it may, and quite frankly, in some cases, if the only thing that you view is being growth is growing revenues. Again, we're focused on improving our returns, returns on assets and specifically, return on ROTCE. And so as we look about where we're going to employ capital or where we're looking at growth opportunities, we do that with a focus on improvement in each of those areas. And so far, we haven't seen anything that would indicate that we need to step outside that 3% GSIB category right now in order to seize opportunities that are accretive to our ROA and our ROTCE. So maybe we've had to reapportion capital from something that is less -- produces lower ROA or lower ROTCE in order to move it into a higher ROA or ROTCE. But we think that's the right way to manage resources.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Erika Najarian</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay, great. And just a follow-up. I just wanted to make sure I understood your response to John's question correctly when he was asking about card. Just taking a step back, as we think about operating leverage in the North American consumer bank overall, should we interpret your answer as operating leverage is likely going to be more achievable in 2018, given the investment cycle?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yes, and I'm trying to avoid getting specific in years and everything else. We're working through a lot of that right now. But in very broad terms, yes, it will be more likely to be in '18 than it will be in '17, just given everything else. But again, I'm not able to give specifics on any year at this point.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Hi. Good morning. Hey, just a couple of questions. One is just to follow up a little bit on the investment spend in Mexico. I just -- I know I heard you indicate the branches and ATMs, et cetera. Is that getting it up to speed with what you've been doing globally? Or is there something else? I know that's moving it forward. Is that going to be at the cutting-edge of what you're doing globally? Maybe you could speak to also how you're tying together the network between the U.S. and Mexico as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Sure, I'll start. So if you look at our footprint in Mexico, we've got about 1,500 branches in Mexico today, and I'd say a lot of that investment spend, if you went down there and looked, Betsy, is getting these branches up to where they should be from an appearance, from a technology perspective. The other piece is today, we\u2019ve got about 7,500 ATMs in Mexico. We want to do two things. We not only want to move towards smart ATMs as Mexico and Mexico banking move more towards digital. We also want to increase the number of ATMs. And what we've talked about is going from 7,500 to 10,000.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And at the same time, going to the earlier part of your question, you'll see us continuing to employ our strategy around branch optimization. And the introduction of smart branches gives us that flexibility that you've seen us using in Asia, in the U.S. and other parts of the world around that. And so it's kind of a combination of those. And the other piece we talked about is the technology piece, and that technology piece really serves our ability to continue to bring the platforms of the historic Citi together with Banamex, now Citibanamex, and trying to make sure we're offering the best of each to each.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And that's within Mexico, the Citibanamex, the Citi piece in Mexico and the Banamex piece in Mexico coming together, not Citi U.S. linked up with Mexico Banamex?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">No.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. And then Mexico's had real-time banking for a while. I know that here in the U.S., we're beginning to launch that. I know you -- there's a press release I saw that you were going to be joining Clear Exchange. So maybe if you could speak a little bit to what your goals are there for real-time banking. And is there anything on money transfer in general between the two countries as well?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Well, starting at one, I don't have the statistics in front of me. But when you look at branch transactions in Mexico and the way our customers like to bank, they're very, I guess, for lack of a better term, branch-dependent or they really favor coming into the branches. And so the move towards digital is occurring certainly slower than the U.S. or parts of Asia. But we want to make sure we're there on the forefront in terms of having that technology in place and having to have the ability to convert as people care to do that. And we think that'll continue to happen over time, although, for right now, it feels like it's certainly occurring at a slower pace than the rest of the world.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. And then just on, like, is there anything there with money transfer between the two countries or not really?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Well, of course, there's money transfer between the two countries. I don't know of anything and Clear Ex [ph] that necessarily promotes that. And obviously, around money-management across that border, you got to be smart about knowing your customer and your systems you have in place around KYC AML. And clearly, we continue to make investments on that front. And as part of not just Mexico but who we are, we are a large mover of money around the world, and certainly, Mexico's one of those places where it's the same.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. I appreciate that. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I'm actually all set. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thanks for taking my call. Just a couple of quickies, perhaps. John, how are you all thinking about the potential for capital markets disruption from the beginning of the Brexit negotiations? There's been a lot of commentary about potential costs, but I guess I'm just curious on the revenue side, how you are thinking about -- how that might play out over the next couple of quarters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Matt, it's Mike. From -- we don't have a lot of answers right now. And as the Prime Minister came out, I guess, it was last week or 1.5 weeks ago, Article 50 won't be invoked until March of next year. That then starts to clock on a 2-year window. And I think it's our own belief, based on a series of elections in Europe, the combination of France and Germany, that information is probably going to be more back-end loaded than front-end loaded. And so what we've been working for is making sure, as that information comes out, we're in a position to continue to service our clients really no matter what. And when you think about our franchise, we not only have a sizable franchise in U.K., we also operate in 20 of the 27 EU countries.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And so we've got flexibility. We've got our passport bank already established in Ireland. We've got the pipes connected, to, certainly, the larger countries within the EU. So we've got flexibility around that. And what we've said in the meetings that I've had with both U.K. and other European officials, we're going to watch and see this unfold, but our primary goal here is to make sure that in an undisrupted way, we can continue to serve our clients. And we think our structure today gives us time and flexibility. And when the time is right, we'll make a decision of ultimately what we're going to do. But we'd like to benefit as much information as possible before we make that decision, and we just don't have it today.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. And just, John, just a question on the card business and the investments you're making there. There have obviously been a couple of new products that have been either introduced or revamped in the U.S. market over the last quarter or so. I guess, I'm curious how you're thinking about the competitive landscape. And does that potentially put some greater pressure on you to increase investment relative to rewards in the card space? And does that have an effect on potential returns on that business over the next couple of years?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yes, the cards business has always been competitive. So people introducing new products is nothing new. One of the new products that got introduced appears to be an answer -- an attempt to answer how our Prestige product, which has been out there now for maybe 5 years or so, and we still think that the Prestige card that we have is a mentally strong offering and should withstand the test. So we don't see anything there in some of these new issuance, these new introductions that would cause us to change our view as to where we can drive the cards business over time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. And then just finally for me, in terms of the net interest margin, you expect that to be stable in the fourth quarter? Last quarter, you had anticipated that Costco might have a modest benefit to the margin. Where is the change in the outlook there? Is it just cash balances or is it something else?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yes, you hit it, you hit it. When we -- on the second quarter NIM, as you remember, was 286 basis points. And the guidance we put out suggested that we thought third quarter NIM could grow to 290 basis points. And as we said, embedded in this assumption was that we'd get about a 3 basis point lift from Costco. And we thought an additional 3 basis point improvement by normalizing average cash balances. And we knew that we had a 2 basis point drag coming from the increase at a higher FDIC assessment that all the large banks got. So that's sort of how we got to the 290.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So then you ask, okay, so what actually happened? Well, we got the 3 basis points from Costco. As a matter of fact, our loan book actually contributed a 4 basis point improvement to NIM. We got the additional FDIC assessment so that did cost us too. But as we mentioned in some of our commentary, we took on additional deposits to support client activity, and therefore, we just didn't get the improvement that we were seeking from lowering the average cash or HQLA. And then finally, we had a 2 basis point hit with the lower NIM on our trading book. And the trading book NIM is always difficult to forecast. So 4 basis points up on loans, 2 basis points down on trading, 2 basis points down from FDIC, flat.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Hi. Good afternoon. I have a quick question on the Costco. You mentioned the new account openings. But can you give some color on the progression of those new account openings? Like, are you at a run rate right now where you can say this is about, on average, what we're opening per week or per month?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">No, I think we're still in the early days of this. Obviously, as I mentioned a little bit earlier, Costco had not been able to issue cards for 7 months or so. So there's been a large pent-up demand for these cards. So I certainly would have want to put the first 3.5 months and generating 800,000 new accounts as a new run rate. But it is -- it still is generating new accounts at a faster rate than we thought it was going to. And just like with everything else with the Costco portfolio, I think we'll know more and be able to give you a better sense as to sustained run rates of growth, et cetera, over the course of the next two to three quarters. It's 1.5 quarters, not even a quarter, it's 4 months today, just about since we took over the book. And it takes a while to get into the normal rhythm so you can actually have an understanding as to the way the portfolio is going to operate. And as we develop that level of comfort and understanding, we'll be happy to provide you with more color.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay. And then I had just one -- a different question on the -- you mentioned that there was an improvement in the yield in Asia. Can you maybe give some background on what's allowing you to have improved deal? Is it a change in geographies? Or is it just new loans coming out at higher yields?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Well, again, we've been in the process of repositioning the cards portfolio in Asia. We got a lower amount of promotional balances now. So that's enabled us to -- some of that is because the promotional balances have run off, but a lot of that is because these promotional balances now have converted into full rate loans. And that is really, I'd say, the lion\u2019s share of the yield improvement that we're seeing in that portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Can you give what percentage is promotional over remaining balance?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">No, I can't go that deep right now. I'm sorry.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Hi. I was checking in on the DTA. It didn't seem like we get much of a pull-down in that this quarter and just was curious why not.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">The underlying business has used about $300 million of DTA. And then given the movement in OCI, as we saw a little bit of the impact of slightly higher rates but more important, and equally as important, the strengthening of the dollar against certain key currencies, that wiped out the -- essentially wiped out the improvement that we got in DTA from the earnings. But again, I think, on a year-to-date basis, we're doing okay and we're in line with where we said we were going to be. And don't forget, when it comes to utilizing the DTA, for us, it's really being focused on utilizing the FTCs, and we remain on track to utilizing substantial portion of the FTC this year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">CET1 kind of growth in the ratio, to kind of roll back 18 months, you were kind of increasing about 30 basis points per quarter. Last year, it was really down to about 20 basis points per quarter. And then this quarter, with the accelerated repurchase, you're down to about 10 basis points per quarter. Is that just kind of a normal progression? And as you kind of think about that, you kind of round out at around 13% and then you start to kind of stabilize. And is that just kind of a maybe just a top looking down kind of approach of kind of how you kind of seeing yourself kind of landing in that ratio?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yes, I'd say, Marty, that what you're seeing is exactly what we want to achieve over time, which is to be able to return the capital that we're generating to our shareholders. And so over time, we'd like to be able to continue to see that, again, that CET1 ratio, either staying where it is or perhaps as we get more insight into some of the CCAR rules and some of the scenarios, even have a somewhat lower CET1 ratio. I think that's consistent with our view towards increasing the amount of capital return.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And then just lastly, real quick question, on the loan loss build, loan loss reserve build in the consumer bank, you allocate most of that to Costco and to the regulatory guideline change. Could you give us a more specific number just for that? Because that really is kind of a setup in a sense of a change or unusual build that wouldn't recur as you move forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yes, I'd say we kind of -- we try to break that 450 build in cards out into thirds. One third was Costco. Another third was seasoning and volume growth. And then the last third was predominantly due to the impact of those regulatory guidelines. So it's something less than the 150 of the other third. If you want to think about that as being something in the 120, 110 [ph] rage, I'm not going to argue with you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Can you guys share with us -- clearly, the oil markets have stabilized dramatically from the first quarter. Are you guys seeing any opportunities to grow the energy business at this point? Or how do you feel about your energy business, understanding that the credit has stabilized and is trying to improve in many areas?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Gerard, I'd say that, yeah, we do see some opportunities. Clearly, as oil has stabilized and stabilized somewhere around the $50 area, we've seen the combination of M&amp;A conversations to combination of financing, refinancing conversations and overall activity and people starting to engage coming back. Again, as we've described, our customer or client base remains consistent to. We are largely a multinational, global-type client energy player throughout the vertical. And we're going to remain consistent to that. We think there's some opportunity for us to go back and you look historically, we've had a strong energy franchise.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Great. And then onto deposits. You guys saw some very good deposit growth in the ICG business in the quarter on a sequential basis. Did the change in the money market mutual funds have any impact on that growth?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Not that we can see.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay. And then finally, John, you pointed out that the trading markets, of course, are seasonal in the fourth quarter. Last year, I think, for you, folks, it was down about just under 20%. The year before that, those numbers declined 30% sequentially. Do you have any sense on what this year is shaping up? Well, you recognize they will be down, but any magnitude?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">No. I think if you look historically, you run the last two years, you'd be looking at something in the low 20% range as being kind of the norm as to whether or not this year, we're going to get that type of reduction. I don't know. But December usually is a pretty light month, and there's certainly nothing to indicate right now that, that's going to change. So I still think that you need to expect some seasonal reduction in fourth quarter trading revenues.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Great. Appreciate the help. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Your final question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Hi. I was just looking for a clarification. You had mentioned there wouldn't be positive operating leverage until 2018, but I think you're referring to a specific area as opposed to the firm.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Mike, that's exactly right. The question was had to do with North America consumer and whether or not it was more likely that we'd have positive operating leverage in '18 versus '17, okay?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Thank you, we have no further questions in the queue at this time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Susan Kendall</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Great.

Today's call will be hosted by Susan Kendall, Head of Citi Investor Relations. We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks at which time you'll be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Kendall, you may begin.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Susan Kendall</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you, Geena. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Mike Corbat will speak first. Then John Gerspach, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we'll be happy to take questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results in capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2015 Form 10-K.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported earnings of $3.6 billion for the fourth quarter of 2016 or $1.14 per share. For the full-year, we generated nearly $15 billion in net income or $4.72 a share. We finished the year strongly; and we carried that momentum into 2017.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We drove revenue growth in our businesses and demonstrated strong expense discipline across the firm. We achieved a full-year Citicorp efficiency ratio of 58% as we targeted while again increasing our loans and deposits.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We had excellent performance across our institutional businesses, especially in fixed income and equities, with revenue up 31% for the quarter and 10% for the entire year despite the difficult start in the first quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Treasury and Trade Solutions generated year-over-year revenue, margin growth for the 12th consecutive quarter. We successfully navigated the volatility in the energy sector, earlier in the year resulting in solid credit performance consistent with our target client strategy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">In Global Consumer, our U.S. branded cards business continues to see the early benefits from the Costco portfolio and our other cards products also delivered revenue growth. Internationally, we again generated revenue growth and positive operating leverage in both Asia and Mexico. And we continued our investment in Mexico, where we had scale, a strong brand position, and the opportunity to drive improved wallet share and returns.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">2016 was a very important year for Citi in several respects. This marks the last time, we'll report the results of Citi Holdings separately. We will end this chapter much differently than we began. At its peak, it had over $800 billion in assets generating sometimes multibillion dollar losses in a single quarter. Today Holdings $54 billion of assets are only 3% of Citigroup's balance sheet and for the 10th quarter in a row, Holdings was profitable with $87 million of net income. The results of Citigroup today are driven by the core franchise and we no longer need to distinguish between core and non-core.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In short, the restructuring is over, Citi is a unique and resilient franchise and after a lot of hard work, we will focus on further optimizing its performance to the benefit of our shareholders. We won't take our eye off the ball on expenses and are committed to investing only in areas where we're going to drive improved returns. And in fact, we're beginning to produce the capital returns our investors expect and deserve.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In 2016, we returned nearly $11 billion in capital to our shareholders. This reflected the impact of our original capital plan as well as the incremental increase we announced in November. That raises the total return to $12.2 billion for the 2016 CCAR cycle. And you're seeing the results, buybacks of common stock, a core element of the plan drove down the common shares outstanding by 181 million shares or 6% during the year and our tangible book value increased to $64.57, up 7% for the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Even with this capital return, we ended the year with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 12.5%, 40 basis points higher than we started the year. And as you can see, the capability of this franchise to both generate and return very significant amounts of capital is quite powerful.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We move closer to our aspiration to be an indisputably strong and stable institution. The feedback we received from the FED and the FDIC in our resolution plan was another significant milestone for our firm during the year. And we are committed to improving not just our return of, but our return on capital. Excluding the capital supporting disallowed DTA, we generated a 9% return on our tangible common equity in 2016 and given our trajectory, we expect to reach at least 10% return on our TCE excluding disallowed DTA in 2018.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Looking forward, economic sentiment is clearly become more positive since the U.S. election. In general, the benefit from pro-growth policies as well as our clients. In addition, we see a path for more consistent interest rate increases and revenue opportunities in areas such as infrastructure investment. And while corporate tax reform may lead to a writing down of a proportion of our deferred tax assets, it should also result in higher net income and improved returns.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">At this point, no one actually knows what would become U.S. policy. But I believe that there are pent up and capital investment opportunities which corporates are poised to act on given the right circumstances. This could boost GDP growth in the U.S. and beyond given the significance of our economy globally.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">So we enter the year with a healthy amount of optimism about the prospects of growth strengthening. John will go through our presentation and then we'll be happy to answer your questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Thank you, Mike, and good morning everyone. Starting on Slide 3, we show total Citigroup results. Revenues of $17 billion in the fourth quarter declined 9% from the prior year and expenses decreased 9% as well each driven primarily by the continued wind down of Citi Holdings, as well as the impact of foreign exchange translation. In our core Citicorp franchise revenues grew 6% year-over-year, while expenses declined 2% and in constant dollars revenues grew 8% versus 1% growth in expenses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Citigroup credit costs improved significantly driven by improvement in both ICG and Citi Holdings, partially offset by higher credit costs in consumer reflecting the loan growth as well as the shift from reserve releases last year to reserve builds in North America cards.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Net income of $3.6 billion in the fourth quarter grew 4% from last year and earnings per share of $1.14 grew 8% including the benefit of share buybacks, which drove 5% decline in our average diluted shares outstanding.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">On a full-year basis, we earn nearly $15 billion or $4.72 per share with a drag from higher preferred dividends in 2016 more than offset by lower shares outstanding. And our full-year return on tangible common equity was 7.6% on a reported basis or 9% excluding the TCE supporting disallowed DTA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In constant dollars, Citigroup end of period loans grew 3% year-over-year to $624 billion as 6% growth in Citicorp was partially offset by the continued wind down of Citi Holdings and deposits grew 4% to $929 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On Slide 4, we showed a split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Citicorp was again the predominant driver of profitability in the fourth quarter contributing $3.5 billion or 98% of total net income. Pre-tax earnings of $5.1 billion in Citicorp grew by over $1.3 billion year-over-year mostly driven by higher revenues and lower credit costs in our institutional franchise. And on a full-year basis, despite the difficult first quarter, we were able to deliver an efficiency ratio in Citicorp of 58% in line with our revised goal for the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to Citi Holdings. We earned a small pre-tax profit in the fourth quarter with revenues, expenses, and cost of credit each declining significantly as we continue to wind down the portfolio. We reduced Citi Holdings to $54 billion of assets at year-end or 3% of total Citigroup and we have signed agreements in place to reduce this amount by an additional $9 billion. On a full-year basis, Citi Holdings contributed $600 million of net income, which we do not expect to recur in 2017.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On Slide 5, we show the full-year 2016 EBIT walk for Citigroup. In total EBIT declined by over $3 billion from 2015 to 2016. Roughly half of which was attributable to lower gains on asset sales in Citi Holdings and a modest impact from FX translation. The remaining EBIT decline occurred in the core Citicorp franchise. However this comparison includes losses on mark-to-market loan hedges in 2016 as compared to gains in the prior year, as well as certain previously disclosed one-time items that also affect the variance, including a gain on the sale of our merchant acquiring business in Mexico in 2015 and the write-down of our investment in Venezuela in the first quarter of 2016. Together, these items drove a nearly $1.3 billion negative variance in the full-year EBIT comparison all of which was reflected in revenues.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Excluding these items, Citicorp revenue increased 3% year-over-year in constant dollars or over $1.7 billion driven by growth in fixed income markets, Treasury and Trade Solutions, North America Card, and Mexico Consumer revenues. And our operating margin grew by nearly $400 million including the impact of significant investments in our North America cards franchise that have not yet fully matured. Of course credit cost also increased in 2016 as we grew loans in our target segments, including the acquisition of the Costco portfolio. However, most of the year-over-year variance of roughly $700 million in 2016 reflects the absence of nearly $400 million of reserve releases that occurred in 2015 as credit normalized in North America cards.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning now to each business, Slide 6 shows the results for North America Consumer banking. Total revenues grew 5% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Retail banking revenues of $1.3 billion declined 4% from last year reflecting lower mortgage revenues as well as the impact of certain consumer incentives offered in coordination with the launch of our enhanced retail segmentation strategy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">During the quarter, we launched our enhanced Citigold integrated wealth management offering for the Affluent segment in the U.S. We also launched Citi Priority for the emerging Affluent segment and we executed significant enhancements to our mobile banking platform across all our consumer segments. We continue to rationalize our physical footprint down 7% to 723 branches at year-end, while doubling our free ATM access and we continue to grow volumes with average loans and checking deposits up 6% and 9% respectively.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to branded cards, revenues of $2.2 billion grew 15% reflecting the impact of the Costco portfolio acquisition as well as modest organic growth. Excluding Costco, we generated 2% revenue growth as we have largely absorbed the impact of higher acquisition and reward costs and are beginning to benefit from organic volume growth.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to Costco, the results continue to be very encouraging. To-date, we have generated over 1 million new Costco card accounts and over $52 billion of purchase sales and loans continue to grow in the fourth quarter ending the year at nearly $17 billion. In total, we grew end of period branded card loans by 11% or over $8 billion in the second half of 2016 across our proprietary products, Costco, and other co-brand portfolios.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">This reflects strong engagement with our existing cardholders as well as significant new account balance growth. New accounts typically feature promotional rates for a period of time. So we would expect revenue growth to follow once these balances mature and begin to accrue at full rate.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Finally, Retail Services revenues of $1.6 billion were roughly flat to last year as loan growth offset the absence of two portfolios we sold in the first quarter as well as the impact of renewing and extending several partnerships. Total expenses for North America consumer were $2.5 billion, up 6% from last year mostly reflecting the Costco portfolio acquisition, volume growth, and continued marketing investments, partially offset by efficiency savings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">And finally, credit costs of $1.2 billion were down sequentially but increased $370 million from last year. Net credit losses increased to $1.1 billion mostly driven by Costco, organic volume growth and seasoning, and the impact of regulatory changes on collections and cards and we've built a $113 million of net loan loss reserves during the quarter compared to a release in the prior year driven by the ongoing impact of the Costco portfolio acquisition as well as organic volume growth. We continue to expect the full-year NCL rate to be in the range of around 280 basis points in branded cards and 435 basis points in Retail Services for 2017 with some variability by quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On Slide 7, we show results for international consumer banking in constant dollars. Net income grew significantly from last year on higher revenues, lower operating expenses and stable cost of credit. In total, revenues grew 5% and expenses were down 1% versus last year. In Latin America, total consumer revenues grew 8% driven by continued momentum in retail banking with average loans and deposits increasing 7% and 13% respectively. Cards revenues declined slightly from last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">However we saw ongoing strength in account acquisitions, purchase sales, and average loan growth which should translate to sustainable revenue growth by the second half of 2017.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">And finally, expenses declined 5% year-over-year in Latin America as ongoing investment spending was more than offset by efficiency savings as well as the impact of one-time items in the prior year period. We continue to execute on our investment plans this quarter in Mexico, modernizing our branches and ATMs, enhancing our digital capabilities, and upgrading our core operating platforms. These infrastructure investments should improve operating efficiency and returns over time. And we still expect to maintain positive operating leverage each year throughout the investment period.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to Asia, consumer revenues grew 4% year-over-year driven by improvement in wealth management and cards. Wealth management revenues grew 18% from last year reflecting better investor sentiment and continued positive AUM influence. And cards remain positive as well with revenues up 4% driven by a continued improvement in yields and abating regulatory headwinds. Expenses in Asia grew 2% from last year, driven by investment spending, partially offset by efficiency savings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On Slide 8, we show more detail on our Asia consumer portfolios. Starting with retail loans, as we've discussed previously, we have been working to optimize the returns on this portfolio by shifting away from lower yielding mortgage loans and derisking the commercial portfolio, while growing higher return personal loans. Over the past year we have increased net interest revenue as a percentage of average loans in the retail portfolio by 13 basis points, largely offsetting the revenue impact from a 7% decline in average loans driven by mortgages and the runoff of certain non-core products.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">As you can see on the slide, personal loan balances have stabilized in recent quarters as underlying growth in certain markets has been offset by regulatory headwinds in others. These headwinds are abating and therefore, we believe, we can drive modest growth in total retail loans from this new base in 2017, while continuing to improve the yield on the portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">And turning to cards, while average card loans were flat year-over-year, we have improved net interest revenue as a percentage of average loans by roughly 40 basis points, as we have shifted a larger portion of our balances to higher yielding revolving loans. We also expect to generate loan growth in cards going forward as we invest to drive higher account acquisition and usage. We expect these initiatives, along with our continued focus on wealth management to drive sustained growth in Asia in 2017 and beyond.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Slide 9 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail, across both cards and retail banking. Credit remained broadly favorable again this quarter. The increase in the NCL rate in North America mostly reflects the impact of the Costco portfolio, seasonality, and the impact of regulatory changes on collections and cards. Credit trends in Asia consumer remains stable this quarter and the NCL rate in Latin America remained favorable at 415 basis points.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">While we continue to believe the NCL rate in Latin America should settle closer to 4.5% as the portfolio seasons, it will likely remain below this level for the first half of 2017, reflecting strong credit quality and continued loan delinquency rates.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On Slide 10, we showed a year-over-year EBIT walk for consumer for the second half of the year. As we noted last quarter, the first half of 2016 was affected by several factors including the comparison to much stronger prior year periods in Wealth Management. The early stage of our organic cards investments, the expenses we were absorbing on Costco before we had the full benefit of the revenues on that portfolio, and the impact of significant repositioning charges in the first quarter of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">As we moved into the third quarter you could see momentum building again in our consumer business and this continued through year-end. In total, we generated 6% underlying revenue growth with a 5% increase in expenses in the second half of 2016, driving growth in our operating margin of over $450 million year-over-year. Of course, credit costs also increased, reflecting volume growth and the absence of prior period reserve releases. But overall we feel good about the trajectory of our consumer business based on our performance in the second half of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Turning now to the institutional clients group on Slide 11. Net income of $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter grew substantially from last year on higher revenues, lower operating expenses, and lower cost of credit. Revenues of $8.3 billion grew 11% from last year reflecting solid progress across the franchise.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Total banking revenues of $4.4 billion grew 3% from last year. Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2.1 billion grew 6% in constant dollars driven by continued momentum with new and existing clients. We saw strong fee growth, higher volumes, and improved spreads in certain geographies, resulting in the 12th consecutive quarter of revenue and margin growth in TTS.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Investment Banking revenues of $1.1 billion were flat to last year and higher debt underwriting revenues offset declines in equity underwriting and M&amp;A. Private Bank revenues of $731 million were up 6% year-over-year, mostly driven by loan growth and improved spreads and corporate lending revenues of $462 million grew 7%, mostly reflecting the impact of loan sale activity in the prior year period.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Total markets and security services revenues of $4.1 billion, grew 24% from last year. Fixed income revenues of $3 billion were up 36% with both rates and currencies and spread products contributing to revenue growth. Rates and currencies grew roughly 30% year-over-year, reflecting strong client activity and a more favorable environment continuing on the positive momentum that begin to build in the second quarter and spread product revenues grew nearly 40% this quarter also reflecting strong client engagement.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Turning to equities, revenues grew 15% year-over-year driven by an improvement in derivatives along with improved trading activity overall, particularly post the U.S. election.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Finally, in security services, revenues grew 3% year-over-year as increased client activity, higher deposit volumes, and improved spreads more than offset the impact of divestitures.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Total operating expenses of $4.6 billion, were down 5% year-over-year driven by efficiency savings, lower repositioning costs, and a benefit from FX translation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">For full-year 2016 excluding the impact of severance our comp ratio was 26% and cost of credit was substantially lower year-over-year reflecting stabilization in commodities as oil prices continue to recover from record lows.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On a full-year basis our institutional business earned nearly $10 billion with solid progress in our network-driven businesses. TTS grew 8% for the full-year in constant dollars. Security services grew 6% on the same basis excluding the impact of business divestitures, and rates and currencies grew 22% in 2016 accelerating from the 5% growth we generated in 2015. We maintained our expense discipline absorbing higher volumes without significant incremental cost. And we managed effectively through the volatility in oil prices and other factors this year, resulting in favorable credit performance consistent with our high quality target client segments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On Slide 12, we show the year-over-year EBIT walk for ICG demonstrating the strong momentum we have generated since the difficult start of the year. We saw broad-based growth this year across our accrual and transaction services businesses. And in market-sensitive franchises our strength in fixed income more than offset the lower market activity in both investment banking and equities. The most significant year-over-year drag comes from other revenue items, including the impact of the Venezuela write-downs in the first quarter as well as the mark-to-market losses on loan hedges driven by spread movements.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Slide 13 shows the results for Corporate/Other. Revenue decreased year-over-year due to the absence of both the contribution from our equity stake in China Guangfa Bank, which we sold last quarter as well as gains on asset sales in the prior year. And expenses decreased, mostly reflecting lower repositioning cost, partially offset by higher regulatory spend.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On Slide 14 we show Citigroup's net interest revenue and margin trends. With net interest revenue continuing to grow year-over-year in Citicorp while Citi Holdings declined with the reduction in assets. Citicorp net interest revenues grew 4% in the fourth quarter and 5% for the full-year in constant dollars, driven by loan growth as well as the net impact of higher short-term rates.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Looking forward, we believe Citicorp net interest revenue will continue to grow in 2017 with a roughly $500 million impact from the December 2016 rate hike and a $900 million benefit from loan growth and mix including the impact of our card investments maturing in the second half of 2017. However this upside should be partially offset by an increase in funding costs of roughly $100 million as we absorb the full-year impact of our TLAC related benchmark debt issuance as well as a roughly $100 million impact from lower day count.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Turning to Citi Holdings. We would expect the net interest revenue of $2 billion in 2016 to decline again by roughly half in 2017. But this decline should be neutral to earnings as we continue to expect this portfolio to operate at around breakeven. Of course, we could see some fluctuations from FX translation but these are the underlying trends we expect, going into 2017.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Turning to NIM, our net interest margin of 279 basis points in the fourth quarter declined by roughly 7 basis points sequentially, driven mostly by lower trading NIM, higher funding costs, and the higher mix of promotional rate balances in cards. And looking to next year, we expect the net interest margin to remain roughly flat to the full-year of 286 basis points as improvement in the core franchise offsets the continued decline in the Legacy Holdings portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">On Slide 15 we show our key capital metrics. During the quarter our CET1 capital ratio declined slightly to 12.5% driven by OCI movements and $4.7 billion of capital return during the quarter, partially offset by earnings and a decline in risk-weighted assets. Our supplementary leverage ratio was 7.2% and our tangible book value per share grew by 7% year-over-year to $64.57 per share despite the OCI pressure this quarter, in part driven by a 6% reduction in our shares outstanding.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">To conclude, I'd like to spend some time on our outlook. As a reminder, we are holding Citi Holdings into Corp/Other starting this quarter. So I'll reference total Citigroup results going forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Starting with our assumptions around the environment. We ended 2016 with a far more favorable backdrop than we started the year, in terms of client engagement, capital markets activity, and commodity prices and we expect the environment to remain broadly favorable going forward. But our base case does not assume any additional rate hikes in 2017. At a high level, we expect to deliver modest revenue growth and an improved efficiency ratio for total Citigroup, even as we continue to invest in the franchise and wind down the non-core assets that will now be reported in Corp/Other.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">In consumer, we expect continued revenue growth and positive operating leverage on a full-year basis in constant dollars in both Asia and Mexico even as we execute on our investment plans for each region. And in North America, we expect the revenue growth as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">In the first half of 2017 this growth should mostly reflect the impact of the Costco portfolio acquisition. In the second half we expect growth to be driven organically as our branded cards investments mature and more loans begin to accrue at full rate. However mortgage revenues will likely continue to be a drag on year-over-year results in a higher rate environment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">In our institutional business, we expect continued growth in our accrual and transaction services businesses. We feel good about the strength of our franchises in fixed income and Investment Banking where clients remain engaged and our results will reflect overall market environment. And we remain focused on improved execution and wallet share gains in equities where we continue to see a significant revenue opportunity over time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">We believe we can drive an improvement in the efficiency ratio from 59% for total Citigroup in 2016 to roughly 58% in 2017 as we continue to automate processes and enhance our digital capabilities. Our original target of achieving an efficiency ratio in the mid-50 range for Citicorp remains in place now for total Citigroup and we believe we could operate within that range as early as 2018.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Citigroup cost of credit should be somewhat higher in 2017 driven by loan growth and seasoning and our tax rate should be in the range of around 31%. We also expect continued significant EPS benefits from our share buybacks during the year. As Mike described earlier, we believe we're on the right path to improve our return on tangible common equity excluding the capital supporting disallowed DTA from 9% in 2016 to at least 10% in 2018 and we should demonstrate progress towards that goal this year as we continue to drive efficiencies across the franchise and begin to see the full benefit of our cards investments in the second half of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">We continue to believe that we are capable of producing a return on tangible common equity of roughly 14% over time as we previously disclosed. And an important milestone on that path will be achieving at least a 10% ROTCE on the full amount of our tangible common equity, which we believe we could achieve as early as 2019 depending on the rate environment as well as the outcome of tax reform.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">With that Mike and I will be happy to take any questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p8\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">[Operator Instructions].</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Our first question will come from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hey Mike, it seems like this was you've been the most optimistic on this call than you have and I think since you started. How do we think about that in the context of sort of that low modest revenue growth that you talked about, is it simply just a drag from holdings or you just being conservative? Just try to get a sense of that dichotomy?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I think if you look at the business coming out of the fourth quarter and the momentum we're carrying you could tail that I would choose to split one as I look at our institutional businesses and whether it's rates and currency spread product TTS, Private Bank check them off. We think we are extremely well-positioned, very engaged and right now what we see, think about rates and currencies as an example up 22% for full-year 2016 coming off of up 5% 2015, 27% growth in two years off of two rate increases. So depending as we have said, we obviously did our plan earlier in the cycle and the early fall but right now my guess is consensus is somewhere two to three rate increases, we've got some elections and we've got some things. So long story short, we feel like the institutional business across the board markets banking, private banking all those things are pretty well set.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">On the consumer side of things, the second half growth and positive operating leverage in international was what we promised and what we delivered. I think if you look from a North America perspective, the investments that we made in terms of getting Costco up and going and John talked to the numbers there, $6 billion of loan growth there, $52 billion of purchase sales in the six months and million new customers. We're going to have to overcome some of those promotional balances.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">But the good news is we've got to overcome those that are there. And so by the second half of next year, we should see that really starting to kick in and from the branded cards perspective, again we started those investments and we've seen the revenue growth, we've seen kind of all the positive indicators there but we know that's just a bit of a longer story but the investments we're making in digital and those things across the board feel like we're well-positioned.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">What we don't know and I'm sure we'll get to it exactly how to think about what policy and what policy changes are going to be and really what that means for growth. Right now, so I would argue that we're obviously with no rate increases, we're certainly behind the times in conservative but we feel very good about the way the franchise is positioned.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. That's helpful. And may be just a follow-up on the efficiency ratio target for 2018 at 55, mid-50s for the whole Citigroup. Is there what kind of a revenue growth are you embedding, it doesn't sound like a lot but I just want to make sure I understand is this absolute cost cutting or is it sort of expectations of some revenue growth with flat expenses. How do we think about that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I think it's all the pieces; it's the combination of revenues, it's a combinations of continued expense discipline. As John mentioned, it's a combination of technology and digitization so in there we're in essence really pulling all of the levers to get there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay, great. I will stop there. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Just wanted to kick things off and really it's little bit of media question on the DTA. But it's a topic that a lot people have focused on and John I noted, I know in the past you had spoken to under a territorial tax system with a 10 percentage point reduction in the corporate tax rate that that would result in a tangible book value right down somewhere in the vicinity of $12 billion, although the capital hit would be substantially less closer to $2 billion. And those impacts that you have relate to timing DTA specifically and I wanted to better understand how the foreign tax credits might be affected because that is an area where some have suggested under a territorial system they could potentially be at risk.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So let me just update only because numbers have changed a little bit since when I spoke at that conference back in November, I think it was. But at that point, what I would say right now is again just to reiterate we end the year with about $47 billion of deferred tax assets. And within that there's about $40 billion that are really U.S. federal DTAs, within that $40 billion there is about $3 billion of NOLs which you got 20-year life and there's $14 billion now of foreign tax credits that again you generally have a 10-year life. So that leaves $23 billion that really comes about as a result of timing differences and therefore have no specific time use or limitation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So those are the -- that's just the, I want to give you the context on some of the updated numbers. Everything you said when I spoke at that conference again, I went through a whole series of things including how you might calculate rate impact saying that the largest impact would be on timing differences and just to again update some of the things that I talked about if we now dropped to a 25% tax rate with the territorial system, we end up with still no reduction to our territory -- to our I'm sorry we end over combined with a territory system the P&amp;L hit would be about $12 billion, which I think is consistent with what I quoted back in November.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And that $12 billion would probably have about $3 billion reduction would amount to a $3 billion reduction in our regulatory capital and the change from the $4 billion that I talked about back in November just reflects subsequent changes due to allowable, disallowable DTA mostly coming out of the OCI. So again as I said those are all very, very raw estimates. Within that again, our belief is that we continue to expect FTC carryforwards to continue to exist post-tax reform. And under the law, FTC carryforwards can be used because there is a provision in the law that allows 50% of domestic income to be treated as foreign income. So that's in the law and we don't think, so again with the 25% tax rate and a territorial system, we don't see any hit to our ability to use FTCs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thanks, John. Appreciate all the detail there and then just one question on some of the, on the targets on efficiency and ROTCE that you outlined, relative to expectation some of the messaging is certainly encouraging , particularly on the ROTCE target for 2019 of around 10%. I don't know if on that target contemplated a write-down in tangible book value as we think about tax policy impacts or is that based on the current steady state that exist today.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Well, I think that absent tax reform that we will probably get to that 10% number late in 2019 with tax reform it would be for the full-year. So there is -- there is some element in tax reform that's baked into getting into that 10% number in 2019 but it's relatively small.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">All right, I appreciate the color, John. Thanks for taking my questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Not a problem.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Erika Najarian</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Hi, good morning. My first question, hi this is a clarification question, you mentioned that the base upon which you were giving your outlook had no further rate hikes contemplated. I just want to make sure that the -- the mid 50s efficiency ratio guidance for 2018 reflects the maturity of your investments and so any further rate hikes are structurally higher curve is that potentially upside to that mid-50s target?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">In 2018 we've assumed one additional rate increase around the middle of the year. So I'd just to be totally transparent. There is a very, very small impact of higher rates that we've got baked into 2018 but it's a half-year of a 25 basis point increase so it doesn't really drive a lot.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Erika Najarian</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Got it. And second question is one of your primary competitors mentioned late last year that we could be seeing the bottom in global fixed income pools and you mentioned that the current run rate for fixed income is about 35% from peak although saying that, half of that is permanently gone and I\u2019m wondering if you contemplate your franchise, do you agree with those numbers in terms of what the potential structural upside could be from here?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes, we've long talked about being a shrinking pie. So I think that that's fairly consistent. I think it probably shrunk a little bit more than any of us thought it would during the latter part of 2015 and perhaps the early part of 2016. But again, we don't anticipate fixed to be a pool of revenues that is going to exhibit tremendous growth rates. I do think that there is potential , if you just take a look at fixed in the last say half of 2016 the pool probably grew in the second half of 2016 and shrunk a bit more in the first half of 2016. So again, I mean we are not looking at fixed some expanding pool of revenues. We do continue to believe that fixed is largely a scale gain and we think that our franchise is benefiting from our approach. We continue to consolidate share.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ken Usdin</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Hi thanks good morning. John, I wanted to ask you this year you had about a $1.8 billion of legal and repositioning charges a 2% drag on the efficiency ratio. And I'm just wondering as we think ahead to that efficiency ratio improvement that you're talking about for the next two years, can you separate for us a little bit what you -- what you generally expect out of that reposition in legal versus core and how much of a benefit that lower repositioning and legal might be to the efficiency ratio improvement.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes, when you look at the results for the full-year, we probably ended up at I think it's 238 basis points of Citicorp revenue legal and repositioning were about 238 basis points of revenue for Citicorp. Now that's little higher than where we had for 2015 and higher than the 200 basis points or so that we had guided to for full-year 2016 and most of that above guidance impact occurred in the first quarter, as a result of the rather large repositioning charge that we took early in the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">If you look at Citigroup and let's say, Citigroup is what we're all going to be looking at going forward, legal and repositioning for 2016 was 264 basis points about flat, I think would be with whatever we had in 2015 it was 265, 270. Going forward what we fully expect is that legal and repositioning will be a diminishing part of our story. So I would say that those charges should run about 200 basis points of Citigroup revenues in 2017 and then decline further in 2018.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes, I looking to Mike, I'd say just as you know we're going stop reporting Holdings as a separate management entity in 2017. My hope is that we can stop reporting legal and repositioning as a separate component of expense in 2018.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ken Usdin</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And therefore that guidance does contemplate that reduction right the overall efficiency ratio guidance contemplates that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ken Usdin</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. My second question just on credit. If you do have this improving efficiency ratio out there it does presume also that you talked about the card loss expectations for this year, but just a broader question on credit in general how much normalization, do you expect, are you anticipating seeing not just from credit from card, but just as the portfolio continues to season with other recent growth that you've seen across the -- across the globe?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Well, as I think we've talked a little bit about. I mean, Asia is still an incredible story when it comes to credit. So, Asia we still see our overall cost of credit in Asia bumping at most up to 1% in 100 basis points in the near-term. You take a look at where we're running right now that's well, well below that. We've given you our target for what we think Latin America will settle out at which is about 4.5 again that's higher than where we are right now. We think that's where will settle 450 basis points given portfolio seasoning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And then we gave you 2017 guidance for the two largest segments in North America branded cards and retail. Credit costs in our forward look inch up a bit from the 2018 as portfolio season and we have to think that the environment becomes a little weak, but again we\u2019re not looking, we don't anticipate a significant growth in that credit by 2018, 2019 may be branded cards ticks up somewhat above 300 basis points but it's still well within I think what you would expect a good branded performance to be. And it's reflected again of the quality of the book that that we're building up.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Hi, good morning. John just wanted to clarify, the outlook for the net interest income dollars that you gave it sounded like may be looking at a net growth of about $1.2 billion in 2017 did I get that right and would that be assuming no more rate hikes?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">That's correct John in Citicorp.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay that's Citicorp just year-on-year 2017 versus 2016 and should we just think about that as group now or is there some holdings component we should think about as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">One of the reasons no, no, John, that's one of the reasons why I mentioned if you look on that schedule that's in the deck. We generated $2 billion of net interest income from holdings in 2016 and we fully expect that amount to decline by half so we expect that amount to go down by $1 billion in 2017 because we sold off a bunch of portfolios and we have plans to continue to sell portfolios in holdings. But again, we are not expecting holdings to generate net income in 2017 because at the same time, we've told you that our expectations going forward is that holdings overall should operate at about breakeven. So whatever -- so as you look at the net interest income that we've generated this year, you kind of look at holdings as being a series of empty calories, it's there but it's not really doing anybody, any good because it's one going to go away and two it's going to get absorbed in the overall holdings breakeven.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Got it, okay. But on the net group basis, you have maybe right now looking at a little bit of net interest income growth, so we've got to net those two.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes and again and I think if you're trying to gauge growth, where we are getting momentum and I know that we are not going to be reporting Citi Holdings any longer but again that momentum is going to come from Citicorp and we've had good consistent net income -- net interest income growth in Citicorp in 2016 and we will have it again in 2017. And we'll have it again in 2018 and it will be even higher, if we get more rate increases.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Got it, very clear. Thank you. And just a question on the DTA, John what were the dynamics of the DTA progress in the fourth quarter, there was some OCI impact it looked like and then just, what's a reasonable expectation do you think of a DTA utilization as best you can tell as we look forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes in the quarter, John, the DTA that we utilized through operations of about $600 million, we utilized $600 million through operations but as you mentioned the OCI impact cost us about $1.08 billion. So we actually grew DTA by $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter. If you take a look at DTA for the full-year, full-year we utilized on a net basis including the OCI impact about $1.2 billion. But I think it's important that that we parse that out a little bit for you because of this two different components of our DTA that the series of our DTA that is time-sensitive. The NOLs, the FTCs etcetera, we utilized during the year about $2.4 billion of our time-sensitive DTA. So we utilized $2.4 billion of our time-sensitive DTA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And then it was timing difference DTA mostly as a result of the OCI movements that caused us to grow timing difference DTA by about $1.2 billion. But we continue to utilize that that time-sensitive portion of the DTA at a fairly regular pace. I'd say looking ahead to next year, we have targeted the use of about $2 billion of DTA this year and I would say that's a pretty good target to have for next year as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">The next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Hi, how you doing?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Good, Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">My question relates to your targets and accountability to those targets. The short question is what are your targets for 2017 for ROA and ROE and the longer version is in three parts. Number one would be the timeframe, thank you for giving us the ROTCE target of 10% by late 2019 without any DTA write-downs but from our perspective, you missed the ROE target that you had from a few years ago now you have to carry more capital. So there's a story there. But you missed the efficiency target from last January now you revised that in April, you made revised target, but there's a story there. And then you missed the ROE target of 90 to 110 basis points, so after missed targets this decade from our shareholder perspective now we have to wait another two-and-a-half years to see if you achieve your targets, it just seems like not enough accountability in short-term for 2017. The second question does relate to the ROA, can you commit to an ROA of 90 to 110 basis point in 2017 and last year in the first three minutes of this call, you highlighted how you met that target which was good and now in 2016 it's down to 82 basis points and you don't mention that you missed the ROA target, you don't mention it anywhere on this conference call and you don't mention it anywhere in the 89 pages that were released today then the third question is ROE, what is your ROE target for 2017? Again this is down to7.6% ROTCE that's down from 9.2% in 2015. And after it's gotten worse, you now say exclude the DTA impact and that would boost up to 9%, I would say there is no credible accounting theory that would permit the exclusion of the DTA capital. If that was the case, you should have taken reserve but let's go with a 9% that's still worse in class so again, waiting two-and-a-half years seems like a long time if we wanted to hold you accountable so the timeframe waiting other two-and-a-half years after mis-targets, the ROA target where you expect that to be in 2017? And what kind of ROE target can we have in 2017 but what I'm really getting at if you were in outside trying to hold you accountable, how would you want us to hold you accountable in 2017, what specific metrics after what shareholders have been through.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So let's -- there is a lot in there, so let's go little bit back in time and talked about three, four years ago what we laid out, we laid out three big external goals in ROA between 90 and 110 basis points. We talked about an efficiency ratio in the mid-50s. And we talked about a return on tangible common equity of 10%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So let's pick those off, as you have cited last year, we came in 94, 95 basis points in terms of the ROA this year 82, what I would say this is not an excuse and the 90 to 110 remains the numbers and the outlook for 2017. But since the ROA target was introduced factor in TLAC, factor in LCR where our liquidity measures have come up and our funding, our funding base has changed mix precipitously and when you factor those in, it gets you pretty darn close to the 90 for the year in terms of the impact of those and some other things. So not an excuse by the way we are not backing away from it, we would love to be at the 90.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">The second piece I would say about ROA and why today we probably speak less about ROA than we have in the past is because I think our balance sheet is pretty darn efficient that back then we said, we got a lot of balance sheet tied up in Holdings, we've got an inefficient balance sheet in Citicorp and really what we want is rather than growing our balance sheet to optimize the balance sheet we have. And since we made that announcement like the balance sheet hasn't moved and on a net deployed basis in the client activities, it's actually gone down because of the higher percentage that's deployed in terms of liquidity and the things that are necessary there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">The second piece of that is when we think about the way we run the firm and the leverage in the dials and the things that we want to optimize, ROA has become less relevant because clearly today our binding constraint is around CCAR Capital and so a great example. If we were simply focused on ROA, I would cut the balance sheet right now to rates and currencies and say, you can have what you have dedicated to that client flow business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Clearly, revenues up 27% over two years that would have been the wrong decision and that's what a strict ROA methodology would have led us to do so not backing away from the 90 which we were there, the things in there, you can choose to accept them or not. And again I think we are doing a pretty darn good job in terms of managing the balance sheet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">In terms of the efficiency ratio, we did put out some revised guidance after what I think the industry would describe as an extremely difficult first quarter, we could have sat there and said you know what it is what it is but again what we want to do is we want to have real guideposts along the way by which to run the firm and to give external guidance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And again, when you compare our 58% versus the rest of the industry, I'm not ashamed of it, we're going to do better of it but I don't look at that and say that we are underperforming given our business mix and the investments that we're making. And again, we recommitted to be able to get to the mid-50s.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And the third point in terms of ROTCE, we had and again I've publicly taken accountability around what happened in terms of CCAR and that was what it was. But what we've tried to do is come back from that and again quite proud of our $12.2 billion of CCAR cycle capital and by the way, the expectation is to continue to take that up as quickly as we can and to pull every lever between revenues, expenses, and capital return to get that up as quickly as we have.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">We made a commitment to use DTA, I remember four, five years ago, some people writing that not only would we never use it, we never stop creating it, and we have and so listen it's progress, it's not as fast as we'd like to go, the environment is not as good as we'd like to have it, it's not an excuse but I think in terms of the things that we've laid out there, we have executed against each of them in this environment, in a disciplined and committed way and that's what we're going to continue to do.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Just one follow-up so for 2017 which metrics should shareholders collectively hold management accountable to?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Going forward, I think the metric that makes most sense is the metric around the return on tangible common equity ex-DTA. We think that's an important milestone target you to look at obviously Mike we're still, I mean we still believe that this franchise can generate an overall ROTCE up 14%. We've said it and that is, we're going to get there. We're not going to get there tomorrow. We think near-term guideposts one, let's get to that 10% number excluding the capital that supports DTA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">We've told you that we can get there in 2018 and what you should expect to see is meaningful progress towards that goal in 2017. That is also going to be supported by what we told you. As far as an efficiency ratio we're now changing the efficiency ratio to reflect all of Citi not just focusing on Citicorp we've said that Citigroup which ran at an efficiency ratio of 59% in 2016 will run at 58% in 2017 and we look to get into the range of the mid-50s hopefully as early as the next year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Our next question will come from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Thanks very much. Mike, may be if you could just back up for a moment, obviously over the course of your tenure there has been profound progress in changing some strategic or some of the strategic focus of the organization certainly the geographic footprint and another things so, I'd love to understand with so much having been accomplished so what your top three strategic priorities are for the, the near to medium term.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Sure, so we think about it and these will I think aligned very neatly and simply with what we've spoken about publicly. Going back to last conversation very clearly to get our first, our return on tangible common equity ex-DTA up get our return on tangible common equity up, get our return on equity up. And the focuses around those are a combination and what's necessary to do that is revenue growth and as I spoke about earlier, I feel good about our ability in ICG in any kind of reasonable environment to continue to grow those revenues. The payoff and back in terms of the investments we've made in retail from cards perspective from a Mexico perspective from some growth back in Asia good expense discipline investments in digital and capital return and what we've talked about is continuing to walk up capital return and the combination of execution against those three things, gives us the ability to hit the things that we've laid out in terms of 2017, 2018 and beyond.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Thank you and I appreciate that. I guess I'm trying to understand a little more operationally what we should be looking for. It sounds like continued investment in digital are certainly on the top of the list, but well should we look for in terms of sort of executional things that then translate into the financial results.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Well, again just kind of taking through what we've talked about, no particular one we've talked about our investments in terms of equities people, platforms, technology, balance sheet. This year we, we started this journey at an unacceptable number eight. And this year we finished the year at an unacceptable -- we started the year, we started the journey at nine, we finished the year at eight, but very clearly closing the gap to set again, John talked about, we had revenues down 9% market was down 15%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">We think there is a north of $200 million per quarter revenue opportunity to execute against any type of reasonable environment. We look at what we talked about bouncing around here in terms of Costco. We brought on $6 billion of new balances which come in with promos and come in with costs of various types, second half of next year we should start to see that and by the way we shouldn't second half of this year, we should see that and by the way, we're not, we're saying you shouldn't annualize that but at the same time you should expect to see us continue to grow those pieces.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Our investment in Mexico, you look at what we've done there, not just revenue growth the positive operating leverage again that positive operating leverage and expense discipline. In spite of the public investments that we've talked about, we think that there is more to come from there. Our relationships with American Airlines with Home Depot done this year they should start to pay some fruits pay some dividends out in terms of the future. So as you look across the franchise, I think geographically product wise, segment wise there's a lot of opportunity to have positive revenue and net income trajectory.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Great. And may be just on the issue of Mexico obviously it's become a topic that's become little more controversial, just given what may be our new policy approach as a nation. Can you maybe put a box around what you think the risks could be from changes in either other trade policy or other kinds of policies that might affect, what could occur there? </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Well, as I said in the preamble, probably I like most other people don't necessarily understand because there's been nothing, no me put on the branch in terms of what the Board adjustment tax may mean or what it look like, but as I listen to what the administration has said and the common threat that really runs through everything when things come out, I tend to think of things as really trying to be stimulus around jobs investments in growth. And what I read the administration is trying to do is create the right level playing field. So that U.S. companies have the ability to compete and if there are things whether it's Mexico or elsewhere in the world that aren't there, they should be re-examined and again if you go back to our history to under 205 years and since then towards through trade was through depressions through recessions we've supported by U.S. companies all over the world.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And in this we will continue to do that. I think a lot of it has -- it depends on what form any type of tariffs may take on, and it's tough to tell. One thing that's in the numbers in some ways that people miss, is that a lot of things to go back and forth across the border and in particular inbound to United States or inter-company and so when you think of an auto manufacturer for GM whoever may be manufacturing in Mexico, Brazil, wherever it may be a lot of that is simply their own products coming back, parts gets send in, parts gets assembled, parts get exported, and you've got to get through those, those numbers. So early to tell but again the stance the administration is taking we think is workable from what we've heard and again we maneuver these types of things before and we think we've got the ability to work with them in the future.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Saul Martinez</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Hi, thanks for taking my question. Couple of questions. First on the equities business, it seems like you had a decent momentum this quarter. Could you just give us your latest thoughts on how you're feeling about moving up in terms of gaining share and trying to capture the associated revenue opportunities talked you about in the past and just want to, I just have also a broader question on Mexico. And like, it seems like you have some momentum there. But I guess more broadly it's a great franchise, it's an iconic brand it lowest deposit costs in the system. But you've also been less profitable than your peers for a while, whether it be the Spaniards or some of the local Mexican banks. So what gives you the confidence that you really are turning the corner there and not in terms of regaining share, regaining business momentum and really turning the really closing the profitability gap so to speak with some of your peers. And is there a point where because of either exogenous factors or because you can't get the returns that where you want them to be that you decide hey it could be worth more to somebody else than to ourselves.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Well, we start with equity so equities what we've consistently talked about as an investment in many ways is threefold it's people getting the right people in the right positions and we've done a lot of that whether it's sales, trading, research, technology et cetera. Second is getting the right technology in place and in particular technology around prime broker Delta one, where if you went and looked at we had under invested and there was better products out in the marketplace and really the third piece is around balance sheet. If you look at our balance sheet, we have been under exposed to vis-\u00e0-vis some of the bigger players in equities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">We've gone out and I think systematically gone out and try to find the right people and put them in the right jobs and I think those, that work is largely in place, but we'll always look to invest there where it makes sense.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">On the technology side, we began those investments awhile back probably continue through this year, but I think if you look at what we've been able to do on the prime brokerage side and again we've got the flexibility around our supplemental leverage ratio and around capacity on our balance sheet smartly to take those balances on and with those balances obviously come trading flows in volumes and so that obviously continues.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And so the pieces there are in place. And again what we've said in here is we're not right now positioning an expense base in a mindset of being number one but we think to get into that five, six region is the first stop and a reassessment is probably at least a $200 million revenue per quarter opportunity and you've seen. So we're now closing in on number seven and we are going to systematically continue to go at that. And so we've done it in our other businesses. And again as we've described historically these aren't new relationships to the firm. We've got very strong sales and trading relationships. We've got very strong corporate banking relationships. So we've got penetration, we've just got to show the right coverage, right product, right commitment to the business and the other pieces -- the other pieces should follow suit.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">From a Mexico perspective, we have admitted that that through the crisis for a period of time, we underinvested in our Mexico franchise. At the same time, we probably saw as you referenced the Spaniards and others investing and investing in a couple of ways, investing in service, investing in technology, investing in advertising, investing in credit and probably a number of our competitors have been much more aggressive with the balance sheet than we had been certainly through the crisis until more recently.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Obviously we want to be smart about that, we want to stay committed to the segments that make sense for us but again our investments that we're talking about here around investments in ATMs and around branches if you have been down there and you probably have branches are tired and branch banking is still a very important, the predominance of activity still takes place in a branch, it won't be that way forever but the investments there for the branch refurbishments increase client satisfaction, the investments into the ATMs and into digital and smart ATMs gives us the ability as Mexico will transition from physical to digital, the transition 20% of the depositor base in Mexico in that shift.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And we think we've got the opportunity around technology and a lot of this we have said is label this investment but candidly a lot of it in many ways is deferred CapEx and it's things that we need to do and we think we've got the ability not just to maintain but to grow share and to grow profitability and again we started to see that in the latter half of the year our ability to smartly to be able to do that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">In terms of the final part of your question, would we ever get to the point I would argue when I look at the demographics of Mexico, Panamax in Mexico, very strong and I would argue as we have had the conversations with the inbound administration around a smart border policy, a smart trade policy and that border adjustments are not going to take away the labor arbitrage between Mexico and the U.S. completely.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So how do we actually partner with our neighbor to create a supply chain, to create a competitive advantage around energy independence, around food independence, around technology, around as competitive a labor force that exist anywhere in the world, the creative supply chain that truly competes on a global basis and we think that's lots of stake and we think our total hold there down in Mexico gives us a unique position to benefit from that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Saul Martinez</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay, great thanks, thanks for the thoughtful answer.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Hi, John. I think you are in the midst of answering the question from floor related to which metrics -- which target should shareholders whole management accountable to in 2017? And I think what I heard you say 2017 efficiency 58% from 59%, 2018 10% ROTCE ex-DTA and efficiency in the mid-50s with only one rate hike and in 2019 you get a 10% ROTCE not excluding the DTA either for the full-year or late in the year depending what happens with the write-down, is that correct and which metrics we hold you accountable to in the shorter-term?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">In the shorter-term, Mike that's why we gave you the 2017 efficiency ratio of 58%. I think that's a pretty clear efficiency ratio to measure us by next year. And I think Mike was pretty clear on 2018, which is in ROTCE again excluding the DTA capital but it's progress of 10% and during 2017, the expectation is that you're going to see meaningful progress towards that goal. Not going to give you an exact number at this point in time but you can expect that we have to demonstrate progress towards that goal otherwise that 10% goal in 2018 will be credible by the time we get to the end of 17.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And what was the ROTCE of 14% or did I hear that wrong, is that kind of an aspirational goal?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">That's still is what we think that the franchise is capable of producing and that is -- that is where we are going to get to. If you go to Slide 20 in the deck, you take a look at Slide 20 that kind of summarizes where we are today. We've said that we believe that the entire franchise is capable of generating an 14% -- an ROTCE of 14% or higher. We are at 7.6%. Okay. So that means that there is a gap of 640 basis points that we need to bridge, now there is going to be many actions that are going to contribute to closing that gap but you can, you can probably say that they fit into three broad buckets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Structural, business performance, and call it environmental rates, I think the structural elements are all the items that we've discussed. We need to reduce to $29 billion of capital that we currently have supporting the DTA on which we earn nothing. We need to complete the wind down of holdings and free up the remaining capital that we have caught up in the credit and market risk RWA that's in that segment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And finally, we're currently operating at a CVT1 capital ratio of 12.5%. Going forward, again, as we've demonstrated our ability to do this, we should be able to operate more in line with a ratio of 11.5% maybe even slightly lower, yes. We would expect these improvements and that's going to close roughly 40% of the gap let's say call that out of the 640 roughly 250 basis points. Now we've got plans in place for each of them, we are going to continue to utilize the DTA. We continue to wind down holdings and as Mike said, we're going to be increasing the amount of capital that we return each year to our shareholders. So that will be returning an amount of capital that is at least equal to the amount of capital that we generate each year. That's all in our plans; we would expect business performance to cover another 40% of the gap. Another 250 basis points without any benefit any, any benefit from the rising interest rates other than to say that 25 basis points that I talked about in 2018.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">So our Citigroup goal of 14% requires ICG to operate at an ROTCE of 14% and GCB of 20% and for Citigroup to operate in an efficiency ratio in the mid-50s. We've already talked about how we're going to get to that mid-50s, ICG generated 12.3% ROTCE in 2016, you see it right there on that page. And we would expect the investments that we made in our equities business along with the continued growth in investment banking and PTS to help us close this gap.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">With GCB the gap between consumers, the gap between our target of 20% and the 14% that we generated in 2016 is much larger. But again, we believe that the investments that we've made and are continuing to make our branded cards franchise as Mike mentioned in Mexico and in Asia that's going to help us significantly close this gap and we expect to show you continuous improvement in GCB's ROTCE each year from this point forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And then the final 20% that's likely to come from race, when I think yes, I think it might be you and I that had this exact conversation a couple of quarters ago on this call when I spoke about the 14% target then I mentioned the rate environment through the fed funds rate that was 200 basis points higher than where we were at that point so we've seen the first 25 basis points we got that in December.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">There is talk of perhaps another three interest rate -- rate hikes in 2017 and I recognize. This is just talk, but if that does turn out to be true then we're halfway, home to the rate environment that I have described. Now we would see that until 2018 fully baked into the numbers but it is there so, that's the rough outline of how we move from 2016's ROTCE to the 14% target. And quite frankly, with the exception of the rate environment most of it is within our control. I understand that increasing the level of capital return to shareholders, requires approval from the fed but it's up to us to make the case through our performance and you've seen the progress that we've made over the last three CCAR cycles increasing our annual capital return from about a $1 billion in the 2014 cycle, $7 billion on a four quarter basis in 2015. And now $12 billion in 2016 so, we believe we're making significant progress and we expect to continue to demonstrate progress in the next cycle. So, with that as a backdrop, and then we think that those interim goals that we shared with you earlier should serve as important milestones for you to judge our overall progress towards achieving that 14% goal.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Great. Thanks. And a quick question on the margin guidance you're getting with the 286 for 2017 is the right way to think about that as maybe just in the first quarter of 2017 that the increased investment spend, maybe takes away some of the benefits from the increased in rates in December I guess and I'm trying to get the trajectory over 2017 to understand where and 2017 as a good starting point for 2018.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay. So there is, this is a couple of things that are going to be going on during 2017 during this year, one of which is of course the continued wind down of holdings. Don't forget as we disclosed, we have contracts in place to sell the Argentine and Brazil consumer franchises this year. We don't make any money there, but we do generate net interest income and we generate NIM so, that will depress our NIM as we sell those franchises in 2017.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Again that's the empty calories that I talked about before. We're going to see a decline in Holdings net interest income but you're never going to miss it because it's associated with businesses on which we make nothing is not affect we lose money so, that is going to the press that one statistics called NIM.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Now the other thing that\u2019s going on as you going to see continued growth in the rest of the business, particularly in branded cards. And in branded cards, if you think about what\u2019s going on. Okay, we've got Costco in place right now but if you go back to 2015, we talked about in the midway through 2015 beginning to invest in our branded cards business concentrating on growing our proprietary cards portfolio and at that time we said that those investments, they're going to yield immediate growth in active accounts and purchase sales, but it's going to be 24 months roughly two years before they reach maturity and really became profitable.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">The milestones we gave you milestones as far as you may be the middle of 2016 before the investments produce growth in A&amp;R the end of 2016 before they generated year-over-year growth in revenue. And then the second half of 2015 when they begin to contribute to net income growth you hit each of the interim milestones and quite frankly, we remain on track with those investments to mature in the back half of 2017.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Virtually the same point in time, we began to pursue the acquisition of Costco when we closed on that acquisition midway through 2016 in June of that year. And again I think we said that while the acquisition would yield immediate growth in accounts in purchase sales and loans because of purchase accounting it's going to be a full 12 months before the deal was accretive to income. Again pointing to the second half of 2017 as when this strategic relationship would begin contributing to net income growth.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And once again, we remain on track. So what you see, if you take a look at the A&amp;R that, that's again in the branded cards section of the supplement. We've seen growth in A&amp;R in the fourth quarter and it's in line with our expectations. Our A&amp;R grew about $3 billion sequentially and there's about $1 dollars of that growth coming from high spending transactors and some promo balances in Costco. And the other $2 billion is in other promo balances concentrated in simplicity our value card. Now full-rate revolving balances quite frankly in the fourth quarter were about flat even as we got growth in double cash as promo balances continue to flip to full-rate A&amp;R and Costco was mostly offset by declines in our legacy products so, we've had good growth in the A&amp;R. As well up I think it's 4% sequentially, but since this growth is predominantly concentrated in promo balances it really is yet hasn't contributed to growth the net interest income or to earnings. So over the next several quarters again consistent with our planning, we expect the promo balances to continue to flip the full rate receivables such as by the second half of 2017 our year-over-year growth in branded cards and A&amp;R should be concentrated in full rate revolving balances so that's kind of the final step in having the branded cards investment program and the Costco acquisition reached sustained profitability. And like all other steps and as each of these initiatives, we expect that to occur on schedule and that flip from promo balances to full rate A&amp;R is going to give us a nice lift in our net interest income as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Thanks, good afternoon. Just I guess in the interest of time, one specific question. John, you've alluded to this in over the last 90 minutes but I guess I'm, I just want to get a specific comment from you in terms of, it looks like the capital returns this year of the $12.2 billion you mentioned were roughly little over 80% of your net income and you've clearly set out a path in terms of return on tangible common equity can you give us a little greater level of detail in 2017 and 2018. How you're thinking about capital returns as you move towards 100% that you mentioned?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">That's exactly what the goal is, is to, quite frankly, as I mentioned, we need to be able to return the capital that we generate each year, which actually is in excess of the net income that we generate. So, that's, that is the goal we have yet to see the, the CCAR scenario and everything so it's a little early to be talking about specific targets for 2017, let alone 2018 but again, you've seen the trajectory $1 billion, $7 billion, $12 billion. The goal for 2017 and I've talked longer term both Mike and I've said, we know that we've got to get to the range of $15 billion to $18 billion and we want to get into that range as quickly as we can.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">And is there any thought to may be have an overall 100% payout ratio. Is that something that potentially could occur in a new administration?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">I don't think that it's something that's just only with a new administration. I mean, it's something that we will need to get to over time. I think quite frankly with the discussions that we've had with the existing, make up in the fed I've yet to hear anybody put an artificial cap on a quote payout ratio and the way that --</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">We think about it and we speak about it as to John's point there is -- probably really three components to our capital generation there is our earnings, there is our DTA utilization, there is holdings runoff. And so in the case of DTAs an example, a lot of that from a regulatory perspective disallowed so the argument is that that should not get trapped in terms of a capital capture that in essence belongs to our shareholders and should be returned to our shareholders and as we think about layout capital plans that's the way we think about it, and that's the way we articulate it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Thank you. Good morning or good afternoon John and Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Good afternoon. Hope it's good evening.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">May be you guys, can you share with us some color just about on the capital market side, somehow the pipeline slowed activity levels, maybe even spread out geographically between Asia, ECM look pretty good this quarter versus U.S. and then also what your thoughts latest thoughts are on Brexit and how that is going forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Well so we talked a bit about the aggregate numbers in terms of where we were from banking, but if you would with the term for a minute with our exit rates were quite strong. When you look at what we did from in ECM perspective, our fourth quarter was up 30% wallet down 4%, our M&amp;A was up 24% wallet up 3%, our DCM was down 8%, but wallet was down 18% and it's not entirely appropriate to simply take a quarter these are longer cycles, but we continue to go after share take, share when we look at the backlog and look at the positioning and look at the client engagement strong.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">And if we think about some of the policies that the new administration is speaking about as I said in my preamble, that we haven't seen it yet , but around tax repatriation around corporate tax reform, you could see meaningful investment CapEx occurring and we think we're well-positioned to assist our clients on that front and it feels like right now we've got commodity marketplace stability, feels like there's some consensus around some rate movement and those things should create a backdrop that's open and facilitating to capital markets activity and feel like we're well-positioned against it. Second part of your question? </p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">And Brexit just, yes what's going on in the latest thoughts on Brexit.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Yes, so we obviously all listened to and followed the Prime Minister's talk yesterday and I think very clearly laid out in terms of the stance that in essence around immigration and around law and governance in essence my words a hard exit but very open and what's the right word, very open and wanting to engage around what the right trade policy is going forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">So again, as we've said, we continue to plan contingencies. We got a lot of flexibility in terms of our own structure, our bank is European based in Ireland, we've got people in 20 or 22 of the EU countries, so that flexibility is there and we don't see a disruption and we're very focused on not having any disruption to our service of clients, but we've got, good to see here what Article 50 looks like is in the next few months and we'll continue to adjust to that very clearly not just ourselves but others continue to point towards most likely slower growth in the UK as a result of this for a period of time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Great. And then just finally, John, you mentioned that the Citi Holdings revenues in 2017 should be about half of last year which would be about $1 billion. In 2018, you think could they fall to a couple of $100 million when we look out into 2018 for Citi Holdings revenues?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">I just want to be clear Gerard; I was referring to the net interest revenue in Citi Holdings just one component of the revenues. But and so again if you just go back to that Slide 14, you can see that the net interest revenue in Citi Holdings declined from $4.4 billion in 2015 to $2 billion in 2016 as I mentioned, it could drop, it should drop by about half again in 2017. When I take a look at 2018, it will decline. It shouldn't decline again by half but by a decent amount somewhere between 30%, 40% in 2018 and then it could stabilize after that. But quite frankly this is a fairly low number. So it would be less of a drag on the overall results.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Great, thank you and I appreciate your patience on the length of the call. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Not a problem.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Our final question will come from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Thanks. John just one quick follow-up, I was hoping you could clarify how do you define mid-50s for your 2018 efficiency targets and the only reason I ask is the Street is modeling about 57%. And I'm wondering whether 57 actually confirms to how you define mid-50s or does it have a lower upper bound I will call 56%, in which case, there might be more room for earnings to surprise positively?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">When you get to, we were at I think 57.1% last year in Citicorp and we certainly could not say that that was in the band of mid-50s. I think you as you get to the upper band of 50, the high-56s you start to stretch the band of mid-50s but so 57% would be probably just like it ticked too far but if we got to 56.8%, 56.7% maybe even 56.9% if you want to split hairs in 2018 I think that would be pretty good progress and put us in that band of mid-50s.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Thanks for clarifying that. John, I appreciate it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Not a problem.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">I will now turn the conference back over to management for any further remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Susan Kendall</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">All right. Thank you all for joining us today, if you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to reach out to Investor Relations. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

Today\u2019s call will be hosted by Susan Kendall, head of Citi Investor Relations.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Ms. Kendall, you may begin.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Susan Kendall</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Mike Corbat, will speak first. Then John Gerspach, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we\u2019ll be happy to take questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results in capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2013 Form 10-K.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you, Susan. Good morning everyone. Earlier today, we reported earnings of $3.9 billion for the first quarter and excluding CVA, DVA, and a tax item, net income was $4.1 billion, a 4% increase over last year, translating to $1.30 per share. I\u2019ll discuss these results and then turn to two other significant items in the quarter, the Fed\u2019s objection to our capital plan, and the discovery of the fraud in Mexico. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">During the first quarter, our institutional business performed well across our products and geographies. While lower on a year on year basis, market revenues rebounded from the fourth quarter and our equities business grew its revenues and continued to make progress. Higher volumes in treasury and trade solutions led to revenue growth despite the ongoing low rate environment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Our consumer bank again posted growth internationally, generating positive operating leverage year on year. Revenues in Asia grew, and while we continue to execute our repositioning plans in Korea, we believe revenues in that market have now largely stabilized.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">In the U.S., lower mortgage refinancing activity continued to impact our retail banking business while retail services revenues strengthened year over year, showing the positive impact of the Best Buy portfolio acquisition.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">In a challenging revenue environment, we made progress toward several key priorities during the quarter. Overall, we grew both loans and deposits while focusing on improving our efficiency. We continue to optimize our branch network, reduce our real estate footprint, and simplify our product offerings. We reduced our headcount by about 3,000 people, to 248,000, which helped lower our expenses by over $250 million year on year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">While assets in Citi Holdings declined at a slower pace in the first quarter as expected, we did bring the portfolio closer to breakeven. We\u2019ll continue to take advantage of more opportunistic sales as they present themselves, and we also resolved a significant legacy issue last week with the $1.1 billion settlement regarding certain private label mortgage securitizations.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">The narrower loss in Citi Holdings helped drive continued progress with our deferred tax asset. After reducing our DTA by $2.5 billion in 2013, we reduced the DTA by an additional $1.1 billion during the first quarter. While our capital levels were amongst the highest in the industry, we share your deep disappointment over the objection of our capital plan.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Let me tell you what we\u2019re doing in response. First, we\u2019re engaged with the Fed, so we can fully understand their concern. We\u2019re committed to bringing our capital planning process in line with the highest standards befitting an institution of our global reach.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Let me now share with you some preliminary takeaways based on what we\u2019ve learned so far. To begin with, we don\u2019t believe this is an issue with our business model or our strategy. It also isn\u2019t an issue with our levels of capital or capability to generate capital. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">As the quantitative tests showed, we exceeded the Fed\u2019s requirements with 150 basis points cushion in the severely stressed scenario. And after generating over $20 billion of regulatory capital last year, we generated an additional $6 billion in the first quarter of 2014. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We now have an estimated tier one common ratio of 10.4% on a Basel III basis, and at 5.6% we already surpass the supplementary leverage ratio requirement. While we clearly have a good amount of work to do to bring our capital planning process in line with the Fed\u2019s requirements, we believe we can fix what needs to be fixed in our CCAR process so we can pass the qualitative side as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">So let me be clear. Whatever the gaps are between the Fed\u2019s expectations and our CCAR process, we\u2019ll close it. We\u2019ll devote whatever resources and make whatever changes are necessary to accomplish this critical goal. We\u2019re moving as quickly as possible while mindful of the fact that it has to be done the right way. I want and I know our shareholders deserve an industrial strength, permanent solution that paves the way for sustainable capital return over time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We\u2019ve already begun to make changes we believe will strengthen our process. As you know, I\u2019ve asked Gene McQuade to delay his retirement and run our CCAR process. I\u2019ve fully empowered him to do whatever needs to be done as we prepare our next submission. It will require investment in new talent, acceleration of spend on certain system, and changes to the way we build, validate, and test our scenarios. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">While not insignificant, we believe the required investments can be funded through our productivity initiatives, consistent with other investments we\u2019ve made and continue to make in our safety and soundness, including risk management, compliance, and AML. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In light of this, I believe the right decision is to focus our full attention on preparing for the 2015 CCAR process, which begins in the fall. Among other things, this delay in increasing our capital return means it\u2019s hard to see a scenario where we\u2019ll be able to meet our intermediate target of a 10% return on tangible common equity in 2015. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">However, our 2015 return on asset and efficiency targets remain in place and we\u2019re committed to achieving them. I should also say that although we understand our shareholders desire for more information on CCAR, we aren\u2019t able to go into further detail, as our supervisory communications with the Fed are confidential. I hope people won\u2019t misread the absence of information as an absence of action. I assure you, we\u2019re addressing this issue with absolute urgency.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Regarding the fraud in Mexico, we\u2019re progressing along several fronts. First, we\u2019ve completed our rapid review and have not identified similar issues with any other account receivables program globally other than with the PEMEX supplier program. We reviewed over 1,100 facilities with over $14 billion of receivable financings. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Second, working closely with the Attorney General in Mexico, we\u2019re continuing our rigorous investigation into how the fraud was committed and how our controls were breached. At this point, we\u2019ve terminated one employee who we believe was criminally involved in the fraud and anyone else we find to have been criminally involved will be fired as well as referred to the Attorney General.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In addition, we expect to take action against others whose negligence or lack of compliance with our code of conduct allowed this fraud to be committed. Those responsible will be held accountable for their actions and inactions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We also continue to pursue the recovery of any misappropriated funds. And finally, we\u2019re reviewing all of our controls and processes in Mexico and will strengthen any area we think falls short of our global standards and best practices. While we\u2019d all like a quick resolution of this issue, we\u2019re doing a lot of work and it\u2019s just going to take some time to get it done. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In closing, Citi has a unique global platform, one which as the quarter shows, is very capable of generating the returns our shareholders expect and reserve. We\u2019ll remain focused on serving our clients and taking our franchise to the next level. John will go through the deck, and then we\u2019d be happy to take your questions. John? </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Thank you, Mike, and good morning everyone. To start, I\u2019d like to highlight two items which affect the comparability of this quarter\u2019s results to last year. First, CVA and DVA had a small impact this quarter at $7 million, compared to a negative $319 million in pretax or $0.06 per share after tax in the first quarter of last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">And second, this quarter we took a $210 million tax charge related to corporate tax reforms enacted in two states. These reforms lowered marginal tax rates, resulting in a reduction in our state deferred tax asset for a negative impact on EPS of $0.07 per share.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Adjusting for CVA/DVA and the tax item, we earned $1.30 per share in the recent quarter compared to $1.29 per share in the first quarter of last year. This quarter\u2019s results also included roughly $165 million of incremental credit costs related to the Pemex supplier program in Mexico, including direct exposure to two suppliers. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">The vast majority of these credit costs were associated with our direct exposure to OSA and uncertainty around Pemex\u2019s obligation to pay us for a portion of the accounts receivable we\u2019ve validated with them as of year-end. The remainder was associated with one other supplier to Pemex that was found to have similar issues. We have not adjusted our results for these additional credit costs. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On slide four, we show total Citigroup results. We earned $4.1 billion in the first quarter, up 4% from last year, as lower operating expenses and lower credit costs were partially offset by a decline in revenue. Our return on assets improved year over year as well, to 89 basis points.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Citigroup end of period loans grew 3% year over year to $664 billion, as 7% growth in Citicorp was partially offset by the continued decline in Citi Holdings, and deposits also grew 3% to $966 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On slide five, we show more detail on expenses. Our expenses declined in total versus last year, even as we incurred higher legal and repositioning costs. Legal and related costs were $945 million in the first quarter, and repositioning costs were over $200 million. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Excluding these two items, core operating expenses of $11 billion in the first quarter declined by over $400 million year over year. In constant dollars, expenses declined by over $260 million, driven by continued cost reduction initiatives and the decline in Citi Holdings assets, partially offset by higher regulatory and compliance costs as well as the impact of business growth, including the Best Buy portfolio acquisition.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Sequentially, core expenses were up versus last year, mostly reflecting higher incentive compensation, resulting from improved performance. On slide six, we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. In Citicorp, earnings declined 8% year over year as lower revenues were partially offset by lower operating expenses and an improvement in credit. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">The revenue decline was mostly driven by lower revenues in fixed income markets and North America mortgage origination, partially offset by growth in both equities and international consumer. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In Citi Holdings, the net loss improved significantly from roughly $800 million a year ago to just under $300 million, driven by a number of factors, including credit improvement in North America mortgages, the absence of rep and warranty reserve builds in the recent quarter, higher levels of mark-to-market gains, lower funding costs, and a one-time gain on a debt transaction. Citi Holdings assets declined by 23% year over year, to $114 billion or 6% of total Citigroup assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to Citicorp, on slide seven, we show results for international consumer banking in constant dollars. Revenues grew 3% year over year in the first quarter while expenses increased by 2%. International consumer revenues continued to reflect spread compression, as well as the impact of regulatory changes and the repositioning of our franchise in certain markets, particularly in Korea.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">However, most key drivers remain positive, with average loans up 7% and card purchase sales up 4% from last year. In addition, we began to see the benefits this quarter of our exclusive distribution agreement with AIA to provide insurance products in 11 of our Asia markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Korea remained a headwind. However, while we continue repositioning this franchise, we believe revenues in this market have largely stabilized and credit has remained favorable. We will continue to restructure our cost base in Korea to reflect the lower revenue. International credit costs grew 12% year over year, mostly reflecting portfolio growth and seasoning, while the net credit loss rate remains fairly stable at 200 basis points. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Slide eight shows the results for North America consumer banking. Total revenues were down 6% year over year and 2% sequentially. Retail banking revenues of $1.1 billion declined by 28% from last year, mostly reflecting lower mortgage refinancing activity, and were up 5% sequentially, driven by a gain on a sale leaseback transaction. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Branded card revenues of $2 billion were flat versus last year, as higher purchase sales and improved spread were offset by lower average loans. Retail services revenues grew 8% from last year, driven by the Best Buy portfolio acquisition. And revenues were down sequentially in both card businesses on seasonally lower purchase sales and loan balances versus the fourth quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Total operating expenses of $2.4 billion were down 3% year over year, reflecting ongoing cost reduction initiatives, partially offset by the impact of the Best Buy portfolio acquisition. We have significantly resized our mortgage operations over the last year to reflect the change in market volumes, and we continue to rationalize our branch footprint in North America by reducing the number and size of our branches while concentrating our presence in major urban areas and enhancing our digital channel.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Even as we have reduced branches, we have continued to grow our average deposits and retail loans, each up 4% year over year. And, we\u2019ve shifted a greater amount of our mortgage originations and card acquisitions to the retail channel.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Slide nine shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail. In North America, credit remained favorable in the first quarter, and we continue to anticipate the full year NCL rate to be in the range of 3%. Asia remained stable as well. And, in Latin America, we saw an uptick in both NCL and delinquency rates.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">The higher NCL rate in the first quarter was primarily driven by Mexico card, as that portfolio continued to season. We have also seen a greater than anticipated impact on consumer behavior from the fiscal reforms enacted in Mexico last year, which included higher income and other taxes. This appears to have dampened card purchase activity and is resulting in increased card delinquencies across the industry.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Given these changes, in combination with the generally slower pace of economic recovery in Mexico, we currently expect the full year NCL rate in Latin America to be roughly in line with the 4.6% we experienced in the first quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">The increase in the delinquency rate over the prior two quarters was mostly driven by our exposure to home builders in Mexico, for which we have established loan loss reserves. Any losses from these home builders may increase our NCL rate in the coming quarter. However, we would expect these losses to be charged against our reserve, and therefore they should be neutral to the overall cost of credit.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Slide 10 shows the efficiency ratio for global consumer banking on a trailing 12-month basis. Total franchise results are shown on the light blue line, while the dark blue bars represent the efficiency ratio excluding North America mortgage and Korea. As I mentioned earlier, revenues have declined in both North America mortgage and Korea over the past year, and this resulted in a significant drag on our reported operating efficiency.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Outside of these businesses, we have made steady progress reducing our efficiency ratio from nearly 56% a year ago to just over 54% today, as we have exited underperforming markets and simplified our operations, all while continuing to invest in those markets where we see growth opportunities. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">While we now believe the revenues in both North America mortgage and Korea have largely stabilized, we will continue to take actions to reduce our cost base and improve efficiency in these businesses. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Slide 11 shows our total consumer expenses over the past five quarters, split between core operating expenses and legal and repositioning costs. Core expenses had declined to just over $5.1 billion by the third quarter of last year, and then increased in the fourth quarter as a result of the Best Buy portfolio acquisition.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">In the most recent quarter, core operating expenses have been reduced again to just over $5.1 billion, and we currently expect to deliver modest reductions in each of the subsequent quarters this year. This improvement is expected to come from a variety of actions, including those examples shown on the right side of the slide.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">As you can see, we have made significant progress since the end of 2012 in reducing headcount, the number of card products, retail branches, and support sites, and we expect to make further progress by year-end.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Turning now to the institutional clients group, on slide 12, revenues of $9.2 billion declined 7% from last year, but were up 28% sequentially. Total banking revenues of $4.1 billion were roughly flat versus prior period. Treasury and trade solutions revenues of $1.9 billion were up 1% versus prior periods on a reported basis and, in constant dollars, revenues grew 4% year over year and 2% sequentially, as growth in fees and volumes were partially offset by spread compression.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Investment banking revenues of $1.1 billion were down 10% from the prior year on lower debt underwriting activity, as well as lower M&amp;A revenue, partially offset by growth in equity underwriting. And, on a sequential basis, revenues were down 8%, mostly due to a pull forward of M&amp;A transactions into the prior quarter, while underwriting revenues were roughly flat.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Private bank revenues of $668 million increased from prior periods, driven by growth in investments and capital markets products. And, lending revenues, excluding the impact of gains and losses on hedges related to accrual loans, were $415 million, up from prior periods, as higher loan balances and lower funding costs were partially offset by lower loan yields.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Total markets and securities services revenues of $5.2 billion declined 12% year over year, but were up nearly 60% sequentially. Year over year, fixed income revenues of $3.9 billion declined 18%, reflecting the more muted environment in the first quarter of 2014, as well as our strong performance last year, in both securitized products and local markets rates and currencies.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Sequentially, fixed income was up over 60% on a rebound in spread product and local markets revenue, as well as growth in commodity. Equities revenues of $883 million were up 13% from last year, and over 80% from the prior quarter, mostly reflecting improved performance in derivatives. And, securities services was roughly flat, as lower net interest revenue was offset by an increase in assets under custody and overall client activity. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Total operating expenses of $5 billion were down 2% versus the prior year, driven by reduced headcount and lower incentive compensation, partially offset by higher regulatory and compliance costs, legal and related expenses, and repositioning charges in the recent quarter. On a sequential basis, expenses increased by roughly $100 million, mostly reflecting higher incentive compensation, partially offset by the impact of reduced headcount. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On slide 13, we show expense and efficiency trends for the institutional business. On a trailing 12-month basis, we have lowered our operating expenses every quarter for over two years, driving the full year efficiency ratio from 67% two years ago to 59% as of the first quarter. Our comp ratio for the most recent 12 months was 29%, consistent with full year 2013. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Slide 14 shows the results for corporate other. Revenues increased year over year, driven mainly by higher investment revenues and hedging activities, while expenses also grew, mainly reflecting higher legal and related costs. Assets of $323 billion included approximately $111 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $156 billion of liquid, available for sale securities. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Slide 15 shows Citi Holdings assets, which totaled $114 billion at quarter end, with over 60% in North America mortgage. Total assets declined $3 billion during the quarter, mostly driven by net paydowns.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On slide 16, we show Citi Holdings financial results for the quarter. Total revenues of $1.4 billion were up year over year, primarily driven by the absence of rep and warranty reserve builds in the recent quarter, as well as higher levels of mark-to-market gains versus prior period, lower funding costs, and a one-time gain on a debt transaction. Citi Holdings expenses increased slightly year over year to $1.5 billion, driven by higher leg and related costs. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Net credit losses continued to improve year over year, and we released $345 million of loan loss reserves, the vast majority of which was related to North America mortgages. Looking at the past five quarters of Citi Holdings results on slide 17, excluding legal and related expenses, the operating margin in Citi Holdings grew to nearly $700 million this quarter, driven in part by the higher one-time and mark-to-market gains I just referred to, while credit costs were roughly flat.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">The pretax loss in Citi Holdings was just over $400 million, driven by nearly $800 million of legal and related expenses. Legal expenses were somewhat higher than in prior periods, including roughly $100 million of incremental accruals to cover the recently announced $1.1 billion settlement to resolve certain private label securitization repurchase claims. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">This represented a significant step in resolving our legacy issues, and we remain hopeful we will have better clarity on the remaining mortgage and securitization related issues in Citi Holdings, sometime this year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On slide 18, we show North America mortgage trends in Citi Holdings, which continued to improve through the first quarter. We ended the quarter with $71 billion of North America mortgages, down 18% from a year ago, while net credit losses declined by nearly 50%, and the loss rate improved by nearly 100 basis points. We had $4.6 billion of loan loss reserves allocated to North America mortgages in Citi Holdings, or 42 months of NCL coverage. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">On slide 19, we show Citigroup\u2019s net interest revenue and margin trends. Net interest revenue was $11.8 billion in the first quarter, up from last year on slightly higher interest earning assets and an improvement in net interest margin, and down sequentially, driven by a lower day count. Our net interest margin grew to 290 basis points in the first quarter, mainly reflecting lower funding costs. As we look to the second quarter, we expect our net interest margin to decline by several basis points, likely followed by a modest increase in the back half of the year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">On slide 20, we show our key capital metrics. As of the fourth quarter, we reported an estimated Basel III tier one common ratio of 10.6%. Subsequently, we announced that we would be required to add roughly $56 billion of operational risk RWA to our total risk-weighted assets, related to our transition to the Basel III advanced approaches.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">This additional RWA resulted in a pro forma Basel III tier one common ratio of 10.1% as of the fourth quarter, and we grew our estimated Basel III tier one common ratio to 10.4% in the first quarter. Our estimated Basel III supplementary leverage ratio was unaffected by the change in operational risk RWA, and improved from 5.4% to 5.6% in the first quarter. We continue to evaluate the impact of the newly released NPR for the U.S. SLR rules, and based on our limited review to date, we believe the impact should be flat to a slight improvement.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">In summary, our performance in the first quarter demonstrated continued progress on several fronts. Markets revenues rebounded from the fourth quarter, and while fixed income revenues were less robust than last year, we partially offset this decline with growth in equities, corporate lending, and the private bank. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Our international consumer business continued to grow, with positive operating leverage year over year, and we continued to see growth in purchase sales across our card portfolio. We also maintained our expense discipline, and credit remained broadly favorable. We significantly reduced the drag from Citi Holdings again this quarter, and we ended the period with a strong capital position.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Looking to the rest of the year, our goal is to grow our core franchise while improving our operating efficiency and reducing the drag from Citi Holdings. In global consumer banking, we expect revenues to be somewhat flat going into the second quarter with sequential growth in the back half of the year, while core operating expenses should continue to decline each quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">In our institutional business, revenues will likely continue to reflect the overall market environment, with a goal of steadily gaining wallet share while maintaining our expense discipline. And, in Citi Holdings, we remain focused on resolving our legacy mortgage and securitization related issues in order to further drive the business closer to breakeven.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">In the first quarter, we saw higher levels of one-time and mark-to-market revenues, which are not likely to recur. But we still expect to achieve a small positive operating margin, excluding legal expenses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">For full year 2014, in Citicorp, we expect our core operating expenses to come in at or somewhat below the level of 2013, as continued repositioning and other efficiency savings should offset the impact of business growth, investment, and a continued increase in regulatory related expenses. And in Citi Holdings, core operating expenses should continue to decline, as we wind down those assets. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Over the past six quarters, we have incurred roughly $1.7 billion of repositioning charges in Citicorp, including the actions we announced in December 2012. We expect to achieve approximately $2.2 billion of annual savings from these initiatives. Roughly $1.8 billion of these benefits are already included in our expense base on an annualized basis, and we have achieved an additional $1 billion of annual savings through our ongoing effort to simplify and streamline our organization as well as improve our productivity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Of these $2.8 billion in annualized savings, approximately 40% has been reinvested in regulatory, control, and compliance initiatives. Another 40% went to fund higher volume related expenses, cover the cost of inflation, and fund investment, including the Best Buy portfolio acquisition, and 20% has fallen to the bottom line to benefit earnings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">In the second quarter, we expect total legal and repositioning charges to be roughly in line with the first quarter although the mix should change to reflect an increase in repositioning charges, due in part to the acceleration of our restructuring effort in Korea. For the second half of the year, repositioning charges should decline while legal expenses are likely to remain somewhat elevated. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">With that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p8\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">[Operator instructions.] Your first question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Quick question on expenses. Just to get to the high end of your efficiency ratio targets, it seems to me, if I kind of do the math, assuming flat revenues, you\u2019d have to get somewhere between $1.5 billion to $2 billion more in expenses out. Is that the right way to think about it or are you assuming the restructuring and legal charges go away as part of that, or is that independent of that or is there some revenue assumption in those targets?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I think the right way to think about this is, when we put those targets out, we were talking about low single digit revenue growth back in the 2012 level. And we do think that there will be, as I mentioned, some sequential revenue growth clearly in the consumer businesses, and we actually think about sequential revenue growth towards the back end of the year in our transaction services business as well, TTS.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">But overall, we are committed to hit those efficiency targets, as we established for Citicorp, in the mid-50s. You referenced the legal expenses, and as we set that target, I think another good way to think about this is when we set the target of the mid-50s, embedded in that target, we would have had about 200 basis points of the efficiency ratio set aside for BAU, legal, and repositioning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And just maybe trying to think through the fraud loss, it was helpful that you mentioned that you\u2019ve looked across other receivable programs, is there any reason to think that we should have concerns about beyond that, those types of programs for just general corporate lending? Have you done sort of a review there? And how do we get comfort, I guess, on that front?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">As I said, we, in this instance, did what we declared a rapid review not only obviously in Mexico, but across the franchise. And I we think took a great deal of comfort from the results of looking across as many geographies and as many programs as we did. And as the normal course of business and audit and risk, we\u2019re constantly looking at and reviewing those, and I think feel comfortable with, on the lending side, the way we\u2019re coming to work documenting and doing things. So again, it\u2019s something, as an institution, we\u2019re always focused on and always kind of going after and always looking to learn from things that occur, but nothing I think that leads us to have a broader fear either in Mexico or across the rest of the franchise.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">On emerging markets, it seems like the markets have rallied there. Has there been any kind of improvement, I guess, on the market side in March as emerging markets have seemingly done a little bit better?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">We\u2019ve seen a few things. We\u2019ve kind of transitioned out a bit of the year-end malaise, which was largely focused around Fed policy or Fed stance. And I think we\u2019ve seen volumes pick up, and I think confidence result as part of that. But at the same time, I don\u2019t think you can ignore what\u2019s going on in the Ukraine or in Russia. Those things clearly continue to have an overhang on the market. So I think the overall sentiment is better, but I think there\u2019s still some things out there which I think cause people to pause.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">John, just to clarify one piece of the outlook. The net interest margin you indicated that might be down a few basis points in the second quarter. Is that for NII dollars as well? Just kind of wondering what\u2019s driving that outlook, as it would seem that day count and seasonality in cards would get better from the first quarter as we move forward in terms of net interest income dollars.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">If you take a look at our NIM performance for the last several years, there\u2019s a little bit of seasonality built into the second quarter where we normally just drop by a couple of basis points. You saw, I think, a little bit of an exaggerated drop two years ago. Last year we were down about 3 basis points, and there\u2019s some preferred stock dividend trading programs that we enter into traditionally in the second quarter as do others in the industry, and they just have a tendency to depress the NIM in the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Is that on dollars as well, John, if we think about net interest income dollars, and is there a benefit from day count in cards that will overwhelm that or setting that out?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">There\u2019s one more day in the second quarter, so we will certainly benefit from that, but there normally is, as I said, a slight decline in it, but I don\u2019t think that you\u2019re looking at anything dramatic, and we certainly, as I said, expect NIM to bounce back up in the second half of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And then as we think about that roadmap to the ROA target for next year, the comments that you just made to Jim were helpful. I think we struggle a lot with how much legal and repositioning need to come down in your model to kind of get to that ROA target. Can you clarify the 200 basis point that you mentioned, the BAU legal, you just mentioned in the prior question?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yeah, as I said, when we first established the target a little over a year ago now, built into that target, we talked about having repositioning just be more of a BAU effort, and certainly we\u2019ve had higher levels than we would anticipate of repositioning in the last couple of quarters. As we continue to work through this simplification of the business and trying to improve the productivity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">But on a BAU basis, again I don\u2019t want to parse it into how much is legal and how much is repositioning, but in general, we would look at legal and the repositioning charges to be roughly 200 basis points of the efficiency ratio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And then on the CCAR, understanding there\u2019s a limited amount that you can say, are you able to give us any feel for the type of CCAR processes that you need to improve? Any examples you could provide there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I think I called out the things that we\u2019re probably going to be most focused on around some process driven things, some model driven things, some people driven things that we\u2019re going to be focused on. And again, I think from our perspective, from the conversations or what I\u2019ve heard, not business model, not strategy, and again, I think things that will take a fair bit of hard work, but things that we feel very strongly that we can get done.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Some of the items the Fed mentioned were previously identified. How do you work to ensure against those types of expectation gaps forming again? </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">We haven\u2019t received our written communication yet, but what we didn\u2019t want to do is to wait. We wanted to be engaged from day one on all of these things, and so I think it\u2019s important that we get the written communication and that we make sure that there\u2019s good communication, good transparency around the things that we\u2019re going to do, the timeframe in which we\u2019re going to do them in, and what we think the results of that work will be. And so, we\u2019re going to be committed to doing that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with ISI.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Just a quick follow up on that last one. I just want to make sure, you said you believe the right decision is to focus the full attention on the \u201915 process?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Is that just a function of, like, wow, there\u2019s a lot to do, what\u2019s the big deal? It\u2019s a difference of a quarter? Just because I know that some of us were hoping, like, it\u2019s a cumulative process, you want to get off this zero and get moving forward this year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Well, again, I think as we\u2019ve described, there\u2019s no one big glaring issue to fix. We\u2019ve got a series of things that we need to address across the workstream. Several of these things - and if it\u2019s model related, as an example of one - would require validation. Those things take time. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And what I don\u2019t want to do is find ourselves in a position of needing to rush to get a capital submission in sometime late third quarter, early fourth quarter, to not get the work done properly and not be in a position shortly thereafter, sometime mid-November, to start the official process or the go-forward process of our January submission. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And again, it\u2019s not a question of resources, it\u2019s not a question of people, it\u2019s not a question of dedicating those things. It\u2019s wanting to make sure we\u2019re in the right place, and I think that right now, committing to going down that path is not the right thing for the institution or the shareholders, and so I want to be focused on getting to the right place to take on the fourth quarter exercise of our first quarter 2015 submission. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So it\u2019s a management decision, not [unintelligible].</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Management decision.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Good. Back about a year ago, when you put out your slides, you had one that had that four box matrix that showed 21 markets you called underperforming and had ROAs of less than 40 basis points. I definitely remember a couple, like Turkey, like Uruguay, like Paraguay. But recently, we saw stories on Spain, you just mentioned a partial downsizing in Korea. Can you just give a quick update on where you\u2019re at in terms of that process of culling the underperformers? </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">When we look at that bucket, I think there\u2019s a couple of things you think about. It\u2019s not actually our ambition to cull that bucket. It\u2019s our ambition to actually take those businesses or those geographies and to get them to a place where they\u2019re worthy of investment from our franchise and they\u2019re creating adequate shareholder return.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">There\u2019s several levers we pull as we look at those, and some of the things you just described go at that, ranging from a Turkey, where when we looked from a consumer perspective - certainly not an institutional perspective, but from a consumer perspective - we couldn\u2019t see a pathway to investment that made sense over the intermediate or longer term. So we chose to sell that franchise.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">You look at a place like Korea consumer, we do see the pathway to actually getting that upscale franchise to the appropriate levels of profitability and return, but it\u2019s taking some time and some restructuring to get there. You know, again, you saw us, in that bucket, we\u2019ve closed five, we announced six, which was Honduras, where we just felt, after working with the business teams on the ground and in the product, we couldn\u2019t get there. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And then you\u2019ve seen others. One you mentioned in terms of Korea, where restructuring has been required, and there are others. And those are work in progress, and against that bucket, I\u2019m happy to say we think we\u2019ve made good progress. More to do, and again those buckets aren\u2019t static, and so we\u2019ve had some of those businesses and some of those geographies move out of that bucket and move up, and to stay the course, which is where you\u2019d like to get them or invest to grow. But work in progress, but making progress. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I\u2019m not sure if I saw it anywhere. Did you state your return on tangible common for corp and Holdings separately? And if not, could you?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">The closest that we can give you to that would be slide 25 in the earnings presentation. It\u2019s the first slide of the appendix. And we have not yet formally done the allocation of the TCE for you, between corp and Holdings. We will be doing that later this year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">One more CCAR question. Based on what you know now, is your thought process to ask for buyback in the next submission, or do you need to kind of get through one clean before you ask for capital deployment above what you\u2019ve been doing?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I think at this point clearly we\u2019re focused on the process, and what goes into that is environment, earnings, and all those things. But I think as I\u2019ve consistently said, if the stock is trading below, and trading meaningfully below, the math would strongly push you towards buyback versus dividend. But as we\u2019ve always said, we understand there has to be a balance. And I think if you looked at the quantitative submission we made this year, it was a balance between dividend increase by largely skewed toward buyback. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And even in terms of working through some of the changes the Fed wants you to make, at this point, do you think you\u2019ll be confident enough to ask for any sort of capital deployment for next year in the \u201915 process, or do you think some of these things we\u2019re seeing at other banks, and just take some time in terms of model validation and things like that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I think right now we\u2019re focused on getting the process right. I think what we saw, one of the takeaways from the Fed process this year is there continues to be more and more delineation between the qualitative and the quantitative side. But I think we\u2019ve got several months of work to do here. We\u2019ve got a year to deliver in terms of earnings and quality of earnings in the things we\u2019re doing, and then we\u2019ll make that assessment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And I realize next year, asking about expenses, you\u2019ve given us the official targets that were unchanged, you gave us expense guidance this year, but as we think about the investments that you\u2019re making for things like CCAR and regulation, it will obviously be kind of a full run rate for next year, assuming you\u2019re spending throughout this year. I guess the question is, how should we think about cost all-in for next year, and are you still counting on low single digit revenue growth for those efficiency targets?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">We\u2019ve given you the expense guidance for this year, we\u2019ve given you the reaffirmation of achieving the efficiency target for next year. And we\u2019ll get more into detail as far as 2015 expenses perhaps later in the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And just lastly, on capital, the DTA usage was quite a bit ahead of last year\u2019s pace this quarter, above $1 billion. Is that a decrease run rate assuming earnings stay around here? Or was there something unusual from that tax hit that might have increased that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">If you think about the components that led to the $1.1 billion, it\u2019s actually $1.1 billion of the DTA utilization came from Citicorp earnings. The Citi Holdings losses actually added $200 million to the DTA, and then the impact of the state tax law changes reduced DTA by $200 million. So basically, Holdings and the state tax law changes netted themselves out, and what fell to the bottom is the $1.1 billion. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So I\u2019d say there\u2019s really three variables that you have to think about. One is what is the level of Citicorp earnings? And clearly, at the level that we\u2019ve produced in the first quarter, that\u2019s going to have a DTA utilization of $1 billion or more. </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">The second would be the impact of DTA from Holdings losses. Generally, as we drive Holdings losses down, that should lessen the upward pressure on DTA. And then the third aspect would be OCI. And in this quarter, OCI actually just had zero impact on the DTA. But depending on what happens with OCI, that could either be a slight positive, meaning a reduction in the DTA, or a slight increase.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So I hate to take you through the long walk, but those are the three variables that you really have to establish.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy - RBC </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">John, could you share with us some color, you mentioned that there was strength in the equity trading area within the capital markets due to derivatives. What kind of derivatives were you guys seeing that helped that area?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">What we\u2019ve talked about in the past, our derivative franchise, and in this case our equities derivatives franchise, is largely client, and in this case largely corporate client related. Again, kind of matching against who our traditional client base is. And so we\u2019ve been building up the sales and trading capabilities there. We\u2019ve called it out in the past as an area of emphasis. </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And while one quarter does not a true trend make, I think we\u2019re making progress and the investments that we\u2019ve made in that are starting to pay benefit. And so again, I think as you think about it, it\u2019s largely on the client side, and it\u2019s largely in particular on the corporate client list of where we\u2019re getting the penetration. </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy - RBC </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">On the debt gain that you had in Citi Holdings, what was the dollar amount of that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">It was less than $100 million. It was something close to, I think, $80 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy - RBC </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And I thought I saw you had a sales leaseback gain? Did you guys say in the first quarter? Or did I not read that correctly in the press release?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">No, we did. That would be reflected in the North America retail business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy - RBC </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And what was that dollar amount?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">That was something in the $70 million range.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy - RBC </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">What do you think you\u2019ll issue this year in terms of incentive comp for shares to employees?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I don\u2019t have that share count in my head, I\u2019m sorry. But it will be somewhat similar to what we issued last year, I think. Maybe up or down just a little bit. But roughly in line.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy - RBC </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And then finally, in the communication that you guys pointed to with the Fed, regarding CCAR, is this with Washington? Or is it with New York? Are you comfortable that you\u2019re reaching out to the right people so that there\u2019s no miscommunication?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">It\u2019s in concert with both. Obviously, we\u2019ve got local and we\u2019ve got onsite Fed people here. Those are largely New York Fed. But the CCAR process is run centrally and largely run through that centralized process out of Washington. So I think it\u2019s incumbent upon us to make sure that we\u2019re communicating with both.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So you just answered the question about the size of the debt gain in Holdings. The mark-to-market that you referred to, could you roughly size that for us as well?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">There were a couple of those things. Rather than try to tease through the whole thing, I think if I was taking a look at the Holdings performance, I would say that, to the extent that we point to some of these outsized gains, I think the best way to visualize that is actually that four-box chart that we give you on slide 17. And you can see that the adjusted operating margin for Citi Holdings, for the last three quarters, was roughly running at that $500 million or so level. And this quarter, it ticked up to $700 million. And I\u2019d say that you wouldn\u2019t be wrong if you assumed that the outsized contribution of those one-time items was the differential between the $500 million that we have been running and the $700 million that we ran this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">In terms of the mark-to-market, was it strictly a mark-to-market? Or was it a mark prior to a sale? In other words, what I\u2019m really trying to do is get a sense for the environment with respect to your ability to continue to sell down assets, or whether at this point we really should assume that that stuff is pretty much buckled down, and it\u2019s just one-offs from here.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Is your question specifically on mark-to-market assets, or is that against the overall Holdings portfolio?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Let\u2019s talk more broadly about the portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I think the environment is fine to continue to look at opportunistic sale. And so not uncharacteristic from the past, you get a pretty big fourth quarter where you\u2019re trying to kind of get everything closed, and obviously the buyers like to get things done, and we do as well for year end. I think in the first quarter, you begin kind of setting up for the things you want to do. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">You know, we\u2019ve laid out that it\u2019s the highest priority, to continue to work Holdings to breakeven, but we are going to be very focused on opportunistic sales and continuing to get assets down, risk out of the organization, capital released. And I think the environment is fine. You can see from the way we and others are describing credit, and we\u2019re describing the continued recovery in the U.S., again I think if the prices are there you should expect that we\u2019re going to continue to make some progress.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And while we\u2019re on Citi Holdings, just on the expense side, I\u2019m cognizant of what you\u2019re saying about the outlook going forward, but the expense structure there overall has been surprisingly sticky, given how the assets have come down and the sales that you\u2019ve been able to pursue. And I\u2019m wondering if, at this point, we should start to expect some step function kind of expense cuts in Holdings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">You know, when you take a look at the expense structure in Holdings, obviously the legal expenses in Holdings have been running fairly high, and at some point in time, you should expect a step function down in mode. But from the core operating expenses, we\u2019ve been pretty religious about driving those down in proportion to the asset reductions that we have achieved. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Now, there\u2019s some mix issues there. Some assets are a little bit more expense intensive than others. You can imagine that the mortgage business that we have, that is a little bit more expense focused, there\u2019s a little bit more expense associated with maintaining that business, than with mark-to-market assets. So it may be sticky from here, but those core operating expenses still should run down as we reduce the assets. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">As we look at the expense structure on the Citicorp side, you\u2019ve got a slide in the back of the appendix that mostly seems to be making some adjustments for how you distributed the corporate and other expenses out to the units. But is there any change in the efficiency ratio target that you\u2019re looking at in terms of a reallocation of expense cuts between the institutional and the consumer sides within Citicorp? Or is it all just exactly as it was, just reallocated for those corporate expenses?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">The only change that we\u2019ve made is to reflect the change in allocation of corporate expenses. That\u2019s it. The mid-50s target stays in place for Citicorp, and everything else is just math.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Final question for you on the SLRs. That was, I assume, computed entirely within the Fed\u2019s new NPR, which reflects the January BIS leverage ratio guidance?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">The 5-6 reflects everything but what the Fed came out with last week, and as we looked at those changes, that\u2019s where we said, if we were to apply those changes, the daily calculation for off balance sheet items, for instance, and some of the changes in netting, there we would estimate that the 5-6 would either be flat or perhaps increase slightly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And just as a follow up to that, in terms of the SACCR, as the BIS is now calling it, do you have any estimate as to what that might do?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I\u2019ve got to tell you, Guy, you threw me with the SACCR.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Oh, that\u2019s the new standardized approach counterparty credit risk adjustments that the BIS put out in March, but the Fed hasn\u2019t put out an NPR yet on it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I can\u2019t answer that directly, I apologize.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So just to follow up on that last question, I think in prior conference calls you indicated that the Basel rules would be additive on the SLR, maybe 30 to 40 basis points, if I recall correctly? </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I think that what we\u2019ve said is that, at least in the last statement that we gave you, was that our early read on what the U.S. was proposing was that it might increase our reported SLR by about 10 basis points. And so all we\u2019re doing now is changing that to say it should be flat to slightly positive.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And then just separately, you indicate at the beginning of the call that the whole CCAR process doesn\u2019t have any implication for the business model, mix shift, etc. But I just wanted to understand how you\u2019re thinking about some of the smaller geographies that you\u2019re embedded in. You did have an office closure recently in Latin America, and just in the context of the repositioning that you\u2019re expecting to continue doing here over the next year or so, how much of that is skewed U.S. versus non-U.S.?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Most of the things that you\u2019ve seen, and the one that you\u2019re talking about, Honduras, are small consumer franchises. So if you look at what we\u2019ve done, whether it\u2019s Uruguay, Paraguay, etc., those have been subscale consumer franchises where we didn\u2019t see the path to profitability and adequate returns through investment or restructuring. So again, in that optimized bucket, we continue to look at those. We continue to work on it, and I think we\u2019re at this point where we feel like we\u2019ve got a business plan going forward against those that are there, a restructuring plan against those that are there, and we\u2019re going to go execute against that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So we should expect to see some more of those kind of Uruguay/Paraguay? Or you\u2019re pretty much done?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I think we\u2019re pretty much done against those. We\u2019ll always look under review. And one thing that I\u2019ve said is when we look at CCAR, as an example, and if there are things there from a data or information perspective that we just don\u2019t have a pathway to get a clear handle on and fix, we\u2019ll obviously reassess things based on that as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak of Nomura.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Steven Chubak - Nomura </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">The first question I have is a two-parter, specifically relating to preferred issuance. John, on the most recent fixed income call, you noted that you plan on issuing higher levels of preferreds to approach the 150 basis point tier one capital buffer commanded under Basel. Does the delay in the planned capital actions impact the timing of your preferred issuance plans? And what level of preferreds are contemplated as part of your 2015 profitability targets?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">We\u2019re going to have more to say about the preferred issuance and the capital structure in our fixed income call, which is on Thursday.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Steven Chubak - Nomura </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. And then switching gears to FICC, one of the things you mentioned on the press call is that you speculated that the FICC fee pool is likely shrinking, and you anticipate a 5% to 10% decline in 2014. I didn\u2019t know if that guidance contemplated the expectation for continued market share gains. </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And presumably, if the regulatory or environmental headwinds continue to weigh on FICC, which we\u2019ve seen over the last few years, heavier gearing to flow oriented or transactional activities in local markets should certainly make you better plays.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">The commentary I made as far as FICC being down 5% to 10%, I had intended to mean to overall FICC market as opposed to giving any specific guidance on our FICC revenues. But that would certainly be where we would take a look at the overall FICC market for this year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">As I said in the press call, if you just look at the last couple of years with FICC, it certainly appears to be a shrinking pie. To date, we\u2019ve been able to gain share, but there\u2019s a limit to just how much share you\u2019re going to be able to gain. </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And what we have done, though, is we\u2019re not fighting the trend. We are actively managing our expense base and assessing our capacity. And we\u2019ve reduced the capacity, we\u2019ve reduced expenses, and we\u2019ll continue to operate in that fashion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">We had said early on that our FICC business, for the most part, is much more of a flow business. And that remains in effect. That\u2019s not a change for us. We\u2019ve been operating that flow model for several years now. </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Steven Chubak - Nomura </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And just one more from me on the DTA. Based on the 10-K disclosure, it looks like timing-related DTA still represents close to half of the total balance outstanding. So roughly $25 billion, a not insignificant sum. The cumulative loan loss reserve that we\u2019re modeling going forward is supposed to be a pretty meaningful driver of timing related consumption. </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">That appears to be getting closer to exhaustion, and it appears to only make a small dent in the remainder going forward. I was just hoping you could help us identify some of the other levers which will help drive that timing related DTA utilization, just because it\u2019s such a large drag on your excess capital positioning. I think it\u2019s roughly a $13 billion deduction based on current calculations </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">There are a plethora of items that constitute timing differences when you\u2019re looking at the difference between GAAP income and taxable income, both including revenue recognition differences as well as expense recognition differences and some of the issues that you\u2019re pointing to as far as loan loss reserves. </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I can\u2019t give you a succinct rundown of all of those things. LLR clearly is a piece of that, and as you look at our LLR, when you say it\u2019s pretty much run its course, you\u2019re probably not that far from being off from a Citicorp point of view, but don\u2019t forget that the LLR then we have in Citi Holdings. We\u2019re certainly not looking to grow Citi Holdings, so that is LLR that still should be run off. So there\u2019s a variety of issues that can add to that DTA timing difference. </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Steven Chubak - Nomura </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Are any of them potential levers that we could actually input in our models?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">No.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">John, maybe dovetailing on part of your response to that last one, you had 42 months of coverage in holdings, up from 39 three months ago. The reserve coverage has gone up by 3 months, life portfolio has gone down by at least three months. Could you kind of relate the life of that portfolio to it, and how we should think about that 42 months coverage as we go forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Just to be specific, the numbers that you\u2019re referring to isn\u2019t for all of Holdings. That\u2019s just the North America mortgage. And there, it\u2019s not so much driven by the life of the portfolio. One of the big drivers there is the percentage of loans that we have in troubled debt restructuring status. Because as you get into TDR loans, in effect the LLR that you have is really almost like a present value of a full lifetime loss. And that\u2019s what\u2019s really driving the overall level of LLR that we have in that book.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So you\u2019ve got two things that drive the LLR. One is the amount of TDRs that we have. And I believe that the overall portfolio right now has a total TDR of somewhere between 20% to 25% of the portfolio is made up of TDRs. Importantly, when you take a look at the CFNA component of the portfolio, it\u2019s roughly 35% to 40% of the CFNA portfolio that\u2019s in TDR status.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">The second key driver of the amount of loan loss reserves that we have would be the reset that we\u2019re looking at in \u201915, \u201916, and \u201917 for the home equity loans. So those are two things that are actually going to continue to keep that, I think, relatively high for some time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And just to follow up, should we assume that those TDRs, as you\u2019re resolving them, they\u2019re being resolved either kind of inside of the reserves that have been set up, meaning the values that have been getting better over time? </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Yeah, you haven\u2019t seen us adding dramatically to the reserve, and I think we\u2019ve been fairly steady, at least the last several quarters, at something around 90% or more reserve utilization against the NCL that the mortgage business has generating. And again, I think the words that we would use would be that we expect the vast majority of the NCLs that we have in mortgages should be covered by loan loss reserves. I don\u2019t want to get tied down to a 90%, but again, it should be fairly high.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">You talked a fair amount about the restructuring outside the U.S. When you\u2019re doing that sort of activity in the U.S. retail business, is it that you\u2019re going to be exiting cities, or going to be kind of reducing the density within the cities. Or how should we think about the pace in the U.S. business?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">What we\u2019ve tried to do is not just internationally or just in the U.S. make sure we\u2019re approaching the retail strategy in a unified way, and that is really an urban-based approach to consumer banking. In the numbers, in the deck, we speak to a reduction of branch footprint, and that\u2019s not just international, that\u2019s not just domestic. It\u2019s a mix of those. And we\u2019re going to continue to look at branch profitability, branch efficiency, and continue to act against that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">You had mentioned kind of the $20 billion of capital generation last year and $6 billion this quarter, is it fair to think about the way you will be thinking about capital return for 2015 against those numbers, or against reported earnings? How should we be thinking as the base of that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I think at this point we\u2019re very focused on getting the process, and in particular the qualitative side of the process, right. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re in a position to speak to that approach.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Ken Usdin - Jefferies &amp; Company </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I wanted to ask you about your confidence in the ROA targets and efficiency targets for next year. How much leeway do you have if in fact the revenue environment doesn\u2019t pan out? It\u2019s obviously been a tougher start than we all would have liked in the 12 to 15 months since you put the targets out originally. So if in fact we do have a tougher time from here to 2015, how much flexibility do you think you have on the expense side? And then within that flexibility, how far do you have before you actually do start worrying about cutting into muscle?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I think you\u2019re right, when we put these out we spoke to a couple of things. We spoke to the fact that we thought we were in a challenging revenue environment and I think the 13 to 14 months since we made that pronouncement, I think that\u2019s been proven correct. </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I think the other thing that we talked about was that as part of that environment, we didn\u2019t see, nor were we counting on, a big uplift in terms of interest rates to be able to achieve our targets. And we\u2019re going to achieve these targets through a few things. </p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">One is low single digit revenue growth, continued expense discipline, and a continued push across the franchise to continue to wind down Holdings. And obviously the Holdings piece is the ROA piece of things. </p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And again, I think you\u2019ve seen, methodically in the institutional side, the work that Jamie\u2019s done in terms of quarter on question, continuing to bring down expenses. Manuel\u2019s been fighting the headwinds obviously of mortgage in Korea, but again, sequentially, or largely bringing those expenses down on a quarter on quarter basis, and again, continue to that path, and continuing to take actions against it. </p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">You saw the announcement that came out last night. You know, small, but again, I think symbolic of the effort in terms of another reduction in terms of ICG staff. Again, I want the businesses to be ongoing in their focus of managing to this ratio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Ken Usdin - Jefferies &amp; Company </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">So if we didn\u2019t get back to that path where you see the path to a low single digit revenue growth, I guess where within the franchise would you have to look? And I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of how much capacity do you still have to make adjustments on top of these changes you\u2019ve already clearly made and have largely been working through the run rates, to John\u2019s earlier points.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Part of the reason of having an efficiency ratio out there is to have this not just focused on expenses. What we don\u2019t want to do is be making bad decisions around investment or how we\u2019re thinking about our franchise. There\u2019s got to be the balance between revenue and between expense. And I think that we\u2019ve got to keep that balance. So we\u2019re going to keep pushing away on the expense side of things. Obviously we\u2019ve got work to continue to do on the legal side of things, and we\u2019re not counting on big revenue growth to be able to achieve it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Ken Usdin - Jefferies &amp; Company </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And my one follow up on the reserve release side, this quarter you saw continued nice releases out of card and also in the institutional group. And John, going forward, I was just wondering if you can help us understand the mix of reserve release that you expect or have we kind of gotten towards the end, as you had been saying in prior quarters, about the magnitude of release we could still be seeing out of a corp side.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I continue to think that the reserve releases will flow in card. Can you still anticipate having some for at least the next quarter or two? Probably. I wouldn\u2019t say they\u2019re done, but they should be reduced. </p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">The reserve releases this quarter really came out of both branded cards in the U.S. and retail services. Branded cards, we\u2019re now down to an NCL rate of something in the 3.5%, and retail services, we\u2019re roughly at 4.5%. I don\u2019t see those NCL rates getting better at this point in time. So I don\u2019t anticipate continued reserve releases at the levels that we had out of those businesses in the first quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">You referenced ICG. ICG is a bit more episodic when it comes to either reserve builds or reserve releases or the recognition of NCL. And a lot of times, what you see there is the release of the reserve when we take an NCL. Because we would have had, for a particular credit, a reserve established, and therefore when you recognize the NCL, you release the reserve against it and it\u2019s a perfect marriage. So that\u2019s a little bit more difficult to predict, but certainly from consumer, it should be declining. </p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Ken Usdin - Jefferies &amp; Company </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And ICG, was that exemplary of the Mexico extra losses you mentioned? Was that one that you just went right against the reserve this quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">No, that, for the most part, was an NCL.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Erika Penala Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I just had two follow up questions. First, on the conversation you had with Guy, can we take away from that, given your guidance for lower core operating expenses in holdings, that the pace at which holdings assets can decline from here could decline greater than the 3% pace we saw this quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I\u2019m trying to make sure I\u2019ve worked through the construct of your question. If the assets decline at more than 3%, then the expenses might decline by more than 3%. That\u2019s going to just depend a little bit, as I said before, on which assets come down. If it\u2019s mortgage related assets, then yes, it should come down probably a little bit more than that. If it\u2019s a mark-to-market asset, it probably won\u2019t have the same impact on the overall expense base. But again, roughly speaking, as we reduce assets, we bring the expenses down in line with those asset reductions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Erika Penala Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I thought you had a strong message on core operating expenses coming down in Holdings for the rest of the year, and sort of given the message that this is really tied to the assets, I was just wondering whether it was fair to assume that the pace of asset declines was going to accelerate from here. But I get the message.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And Mike, I apologize for re-asking the same question over and over again, but just to follow up in terms of what Matt and Moshe had already asked you, I think it\u2019s very clear - and thank you for the detail in terms of taking the steps to get the qualitative aspects of the CCAR correct - but assuming that you have made that progress a year from now, is the pace at which you ask for capital return from the Fed going to be dictated by the actual excess capital that you have? Or do you feel that your initial request, after you complete the qualitative process to their satisfaction, going to be more conservative?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong> </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I think as I said in the statement, we recognize we\u2019ve got to get what we do industrial strength. When Citi operates properly, and you saw in the first quarter, we\u2019ve got the ability to generate large amounts of regulatory capital. Regulatory capital in excess of our earnings. And so we need to get the institution to a position to be able to be returning significant amounts of that capital over time. I can\u2019t tell you, kind of going into this to where we are today, what that capital ask will be next year, but we\u2019ve got to get the institution into a position where, over time, we\u2019ve got the ability to return that capital. </p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Erika Penala Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay. I tried. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Related to CCAR, who at Citigroup is accountable for the failed stress test? And what are the consequences?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I am. Obviously, when you think of something that is as important as this for the institution and our shareholders, it\u2019s at the top of the house. So I\u2019m accountable, and if you read our filings, it is in my scorecard, and it\u2019s something for which I\u2019m sure the board will hold me accountable in 2014 when they reflect upon the year. And I\u2019m accountable for it, and I\u2019m accountable for fixing it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Who else is accountable, and what are the consequences? Can you be specific? I think I hear you saying you\u2019ll be paid down because you didn\u2019t pass, but that\u2019s one aspect. Another aspect is making sure you have the right team on the field to ensure that you have the appropriate regulatory relations.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">What I\u2019ve done is I\u2019ve made changes. I\u2019ve asked Gene McQuade to step back from his retirement and to take responsibility, working directly for me, in terms of our CCAR submission this year. And Gene has access to work across the firm, in terms of the things that need to be done, to make sure that submission is of the caliber and quality that it needs to be. And I\u2019ve got full confidence in Gene, and I have full confidence in the team we have to get to that point, because Gene\u2019s not going to be able to do it alone.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Why is the Fed\u2019s denial, the information related to that, only preliminary? And can you disclose some of the shortcomings without disclosing some of the exam findings? It\u2019s very frustrating for many investors not to have more information.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">As the findings and the conversations that we have, not with just the Fed, but with our regulators, are confidential, I think the Fed has actually been fairly forthcoming with the public when they made their announcements in terms of that there wasn\u2019t any one particular thing, there were things across the series of work streams that were submitted. </p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">And again, I called out things in terms of some general approaches to some processes, some things that need to be changed, in terms of our modeling, the way we vet certain risks within the organization, and the combination of people, modeling, and validation, as well as some other things go at those. </p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">And so in there, there\u2019s not one big thing I can point at and say, \u201cThat\u2019s the fix.\u201d We\u2019ve got a number of things that we need to be focused on, and again, I think they\u2019re all fixable, and we\u2019re going to be focused on fixing them and creating the industrial strength process that we need to have. </p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Perhaps the more general question, is the Fed denial a wakeup call for Citi, or not? And what I think I\u2019ve heard you say on this call is that several areas are doing better - markets, Korea, Holdings, etc. - their optimized bucket is about done, you\u2019re making some of the process changes after the Fed denial, you\u2019re okay with your efficiency and ROA targets. So you\u2019re kind of giving us a little bit of a roadmap for the next seven quarters, but the way I look at it, Citi has failed two of the last three CCARs, it\u2019s been 16 years of a failed merger, and for shareholders, it\u2019s been two lost decades. Two decades ago today, the stock was 10% higher. So again, my main question is, is the Fed denial a wakeup call for you guys?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">I\u2019ll speak for myself and the management team, and I\u2019ll let the board speak for themselves. We\u2019re wide awake. This obviously came as a disappointment. And again, I\u2019m responsible for it, but if you look at, over the last 15, 16, 17 months in the job, the things that we\u2019ve done. We\u2019ve taken headcount down 18,000 people, net of adding 16,000 people across audit risk/compliance. We\u2019ve had sequential improvements in expenses across our ICG businesses. We\u2019ve addressed seven underperforming consumer businesses. </p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">We\u2019ve set out intermediate - and again, I underline the word \u201cimmediate\u201d - targets, the ROA, the ROTCE, and the efficiency ratio targets. And we predicated our ability to hit the ROTC on our ability to return some capital. That\u2019s now proven difficult to do, but committed around the ROA, and committed around the efficiency targets, and we don\u2019t view that as the end state of the company. </p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">We talked about DTA consumption and our ability to change that, and there have been those historically who were quite critical of our ability to consume DTA, and I think we\u2019ve proven. We came in and we said, it\u2019s a priority, $2.5 billion of DTA utilization last year, $1.1 billion for the first quarter of this year, and we\u2019re committed to continuing to consume it. </p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">And so we\u2019ve got things we\u2019ve got to do. We understand. We are not sitting here without a sense of urgency, and if anybody feels that way, they shouldn\u2019t feel that way. And we\u2019re committed to pushing the firm forward. And again, in there, we\u2019re coming with those actions every day.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">One conclusion that I reach from the Fed\u2019s denial is that they\u2019re encouraging Citigroup to simplify. Would you agree that that is a push by the regulators and the Fed?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">I think that simpler is always easier in a process like this. Again, in the conversations that I\u2019ve had, the conversations have not been about the business model or the strategy. Again, it\u2019s incumbent upon us, and we completely recognize it. We if don\u2019t have the ability to speak to, to model, and to overlook, govern, and control our organization, then yes, we shouldn\u2019t be in that business, or we shouldn\u2019t be in that geography. But I think we\u2019ve got the ability to do those things, and in the conversations that I\u2019ve had, I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s the statement.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Okay. Well, I hope the Fed gives you any more information that would be helpful for investors before your annual meeting next week, and I look forward to asking questions of the board. Will you webcast the annual meeting next week? Because that would allow the board members to disclose material information.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">We are not going to be webcasting.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">All right. Well, I hope someone can change their mind there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">John, the mortgage originations were down, it looks like, about 37%. And [favorable] rate lock is down about 20. So what would that have translated into in terms of mortgage income for the period?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">The mortgage revenues for the first quarter were down single digit numbers from where we were in the fourth quarter. So as we\u2019ve said, the mortgage revenues pretty much now have stabilized at around the fourth quarter levels.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">So I guess that implies that there was some kind of benefit on the servicing side to offset the decline in origination?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Actually, the spreads have held up fairly well. We changed the mix to be less reliant on purchased mortgages and more reliant on mortgages that we\u2019re now originating out of our branches, which is a better returning business for us. So again, we\u2019ve changed some of the mix of the business, but in general, as I said, the revenues have largely stabilized in that business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">And then just to reconcile that against, you know, adjusting in the North American retail banking business, just excluding the sale leaseback, it looks like you would have been down only 2%. So what would have accounted for the difference?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">There\u2019s continued spread compression that we continue to have in that business. Even as we grow deposits, in the low interest rate environment, on a deposit-oriented business, you\u2019re going to run into revenue pressure.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">And did I also understand you that credit card volumes in the period across both the proprietary branded and the retail were down more or less in line seasonally? Is that the correct understanding?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">From an A&amp;R point of view, or an E&amp;R point of view, the net receivables in those two businesses did exhibit the normal performance that you would have in the first quarter as far as balances being down from where they were in the fourth quarter. However, for the industry, as well as for us, we continue to remain challenged with an overall decline in the A&amp;R and in the E&amp;R. Certainly in our branded cards business, you\u2019ll see a decline year over year. And so that just reflects the continued deleveraging on the part of the U.S. consumer and the resulting high payment rates that we\u2019ve been experiencing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">I was also referring to the charge card volume, if that would have looked different than what the typical seasonal trend would have implied.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">I don\u2019t think so.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">And then just lastly, on CCAR, understanding that some of the issues are preliminary, I\u2019m just trying to understand the broad scope of all your statements. But perhaps if you could just help me understand, how satisfied are you today that you understand what all of the criticisms are?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">I think at this point we\u2019ve had conversations. I won\u2019t be fully satisfied until we get the written response, and then we close the gap or we close any questions or differences that we may have from what\u2019s in that letter. But again, around the conversations, and it\u2019s been, I would say, good, active, fairly constant engagement to date. Again, I want to see the letter. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to be surprised by the letter, but I need to see it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">And just sort of rolling that forward to resubmission, putting aside any capital return dynamics, how much progress do you think you\u2019re expected to show on these issues at that point? And is it possible to actually have accomplished that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">I think the way we need to think of things is we run an institution of global importance, and we shouldn\u2019t set the standard to whatever the Fed standard is. We should set the gold standard in terms of what our approach to the process should be. And I\u2019m comfortable with Gene\u2019s leadership and coordination from the rest of the team we\u2019re going to have the ability to do that, but also, recognizing that that\u2019s not going to be static. Our work\u2019s not going to be static. The bar\u2019s not going to be static, and we\u2019re going to have to continue to go at this every year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">First of all, in terms of the SLR guidance versus last quarter, John, as you said, you thought that the new U.S. rules would benefit you by about 10 basis points. You\u2019ve updated that to flat to up modestly. I guess I\u2019m curious, given what JPMorgan said last week, that potential netting of derivatives and some of the new U.S. rules might help them by 30 to 40 basis points, where you might see some differences between the benefit you\u2019re estimating and the benefits that they might be estimating.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">I don\u2019t know what they baked into their original estimates, so I have no way of commenting on how my view of the changes would differ from their view of the changes. I can just tell you where we are and where we would expect to be.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">And then in terms of the Basel III RWA, on an average basis, those were up about $55 billion in Citigroup, a little bit more than that, $57 million in Citicorp. What drove the increase in the RWA? Was it model rejection or was it something else?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">I\u2019d focus you on slide 20. That\u2019s probably the easiest place to see it, because it deals with quarter end balances. And so from a quarter end balance point of view, with both quarter ends reflecting all of the changes, the incremental op risk, what you see there is about a $27 billion increase in our risk-weighted assets from the fourth quarter going through the first quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">So about a third of that increase is in fact due to the loss of model approvals as we\u2019ve exited from parallels. So that\u2019s exactly the impact that you were looking for. And then that requires us to use alternate approaches, which just adds a little bit to the risk weighted assets. And that would be primarily in market risk.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">And then the balance is primarily just due to an increase in lending and commitments. You\u2019ve seen how our loan book has grown. We\u2019ve got additional commitments there. And so that\u2019s just a general business driver. </p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">And then lastly, I think you mentioned that you\u2019re starting to believe in some revenue stability in Korea. And maybe this is putting the cart before the horse, but I guess I\u2019m just curious as to, given where you stand today, what the timing might be for potential revenue upside in the Korean franchise, now that you\u2019ve stabilized it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Well, I would say that there is a good shot that we will have sequential growth coming from Korea, again, certainly in the back half of the year. That\u2019s the way we\u2019re looking at it. Obviously revenues, we think they\u2019ve stabilized now. I think when you\u2019ve seen the announcement - at least the papers have been reporting about - that we\u2019re going to shut 56 branches in Korea, we need to work with our union there in order to then make sure that we\u2019ve got appropriate headcount that matches those branch closures. </p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">That\u2019s likely to have some residual impact on the revenues there, so I\u2019m not quite sure that we can look to the second quarter as far as having revenue growth in Korea, but once we get that second quarter repositioning behind us, I think we\u2019 then should be looking towards sequential growth.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Your next question comes from the line of Derek De Vries of UBS.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Derek De Vries - UBS </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">In your statements, it looked like you pushed a lot of the costs from the corporate other into the divisions, which makes sense, but I guess I was surprised you didn\u2019t push any of the $56 billion of incremental operational RWA into the divisions. Is that just a timing issue, sort of adjusting your models? Or is that corporate center going to have $124 billion of risk-weighted assets going forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">As we exited from parallel, and you can maybe go back to some of the disclosures that we\u2019ve made on this, with the level of operational risk-weighted assets, the $288 billion of RWA that is an amount that we agreed with the Fed on. We don\u2019t have the models in place today to apportion that last $56 billion out into the business units. So it\u2019s very much model-related more than anything else. I don\u2019t envision that $56 billion staying in corporate forever, but until we get an agreed upon model approach, it\u2019s going to be difficult to apportion it out.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Thank you. We have no further questions in the queue at this time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Susan Kendall</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Thank you, operator.

Actual results, and capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2013 Form 10-K.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Susan, thank you; and good morning everyone. Earlier today, we reported earnings of $181 million for the second quarter of 2014. Excluding the impact of the legacy mortgage settlement CVA and DVA, net income was $3.9 billion, up slightly from last year or $1.24 per share. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Before I get into our operating performance I want to discuss our legacy mortgage settlement. The comprehensive settlement announced today with the U.S. Department of Justice, the State AGs and the FDIC resolves all pending civil investigations related to our legacy RMBS and CDO underwriting, structuring and issuance activities. We also have now resolved substantially all of our legacy RMBS and CDO litigation. We believe that this settlement is in the best interest of our shareholders and allows us to move forward and to focus on the future in serving our clients.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">During this quarter, our institutional businesses performed well outside of markets where macro uncertainty and historically low volatility reduced client activity clearly impacting our fixed income and equities revenues. Corporate investment banking revenues strengthened, led by strong equity and debt underwriting and our treasury and trade solutions businesses again saw underlying revenue growth as volumes continued to increase. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">In consumer banking, year-over-year comparisons continue to be affected by lower mortgage refinancing activity and our repositioning efforts in Korea. But we believe these businesses have now stabilized and we're better positioned for growth in the second half of the year. We grow our consumer loans despite the uneven economic environment and saw continued signs of progress in our U.S. cards business. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Excluding the settlement announced today, Citi Holdings turned to profit for the first time since its formation and we announced agreements to sell our consumer businesses in Greece and Spain which will further reduce holdings assets in the third quarter. The holdings profit actually helped drive DTA consumption which totaled $1.1 billion in the quarter and $2.2 billion for the first half of 2014. And despite the impact of the legacy mortgage settlement on our net income, our capital position strengthened to a Tier 1 common ratio of 10.6% on a Basel III basis and our tangible book value also increased. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">During the first half of this year we generated $10 billion in capital despite today\u2019s settlement. Throughout the organization we're focused on strengthening our capital planning process, improving our execution and increasing our efficiency; we're engaged in a firm-wide effort that includes improving our target client model, streamlining our structure, processes and technology platforms and optimizing our real estate footprint. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">These actions create a capability to make investments in our business, regulatory and compliance activities and strength in our capital planning process. They also allow us to reduce our operating expenses both quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">While this effort is on-going, we are already making some good headway. For example, during the second quarter, we\u2019ve reduced our headcount by 3,500 people to 244,000 and it is now down nearly 7,000 for the first half of 2014 and 15,000 people since the fourth quarter of 2012. We continue to simplify our product offerings and we further rationalized our footprint, shrinking retail branches by nearly 140 while reducing consumer support sides by another 31 locations. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Looking ahead, for the second half of this year, I feel good about how we're positioned and I believe we should see an improved revenue picture. On the consumer side, the U.S. economy is gaining strength as job creation and consumer spending increases. Internationally, our franchise is performing well and we believe the headwinds facing our retail business in Korea are abated.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In our institutional business, while client activity has been lower in markets, business such as investment banking and trade finance are showing momentum. We\u2019ve also demonstrated the ability to reduce the drag of Citi Holdings and utilize DTA, both of which will contribute to the strengthening of our capital positions going forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">John will now go through the deck and then we will be happy to take your questions. John?</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Okay, thank you, Mike and good morning everyone. To start, I\u2019d like to highlight two items which affect the comparability of this quarter\u2019s results to last year. First as Mike described, this quarter, we took a $3.7 billion after-tax charge related to the mortgage settlement for a negative impact on EPS of a $1.21 per share; and second, CVA and DVA was a negative $33 million pre-tax this quarter or $0.01 per share after tax compared to a positive 477 million pre-tax or $0.09 per share in the second quarter of last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Adjusting for CVA, DVA and the impact of the settlement, we earned $1.24 per share in the recent quarter, compared to $1.25 per share in the second quarter of last year. Throughout today\u2019s presentation, I\u2019ll be discussing our results excluding these two items to provide comparability to prior periods.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">On slide four, we show total Citigroup results. We are in $3.9 billion in the second quarter and $8.1 billion for the first half of 2014, both up slightly from prior periods as lower revenues were offset by lower operating expenses and a decline in credit cost. Citigroup end-of-period loans grew 4% year-over-year to $668 billion as 8% growth in Citicorp was partially offset by the continued decline in Citi Holdings and deposits grew 3% to $966 billion. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On slide five, we show more detail on expenses. Legal and related costs were roughly $400 million in the second quarter, mostly incurred in Citicorp. Repositioning costs were also around $400 million, including approximately $270 million of repositioning costs related to our consumer franchise in Korea. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Excluding these items, core operating expenses of nearly $11 billion in the second quarter declined by over $225 million in constant dollars, driven by continued cost reduction initiatives and the decline in Citi Holdings\u2019 assets, partially offset by higher regulatory and compliance costs as well as the impact of business growth. Sequentially, core expenses were down versus last quarter, reflecting lower incentive compensation and continued efficiency efforts, again partially offset by higher regulatory and compliance cost. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On slide six, we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. In Citicorp, earnings declined 18% year-over-year as lower revenues and higher legal and repositioning costs were partially offset by lower core operating expenses and an improvement in credit. In Citi Holdings, we earned over $240 million this quarter, compared to a loss of nearly $600 million last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Citi Holdings revenues increased significantly from last year driven by the absence of rep and warranty reserve builds in the recent quarter, higher gains on asset sales and lower funding costs. Core expenses continue to decline in line with a 15% year-over-year reduction in assets. Citi Holdings ended the quarter with $111 billion of assets or 6% of Citi Group assets. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to Citi Corp on slide seven, we show results for international consumer banking in constant dollars. Revenues grew 1% year-over-year in the second quarter. Core operating expenses, excluding legal and repositioning cost also increased 1% from the prior year, driven by business growth and higher regulatory and compliance costs, partially offset by on-going efficiency savings. Including legal and repositioning cost, total operating expenses increased 12% from the prior year, mostly due to the repositioning charges in Korea.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">International consumer revenues continued to reflect spread compression as well as the impact of regulatory changes and the repositioning of certain markets. Korea remained a headwind year-over-year, however the franchise was broadly stable quarter-over-quarter and we believe we should begin to see sequential revenue growth in Korea as we go into the second half of the year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Aside from Korea, the most significant challenge for Asia consumer revenue this quarter was a decline in investment sales revenues both year-over-year and sequentially. While this business has grown over time, quarterly investment sales revenues tend to reflect the overall capital markets environment and in the second quarter we saw a weaker investor sentiment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We provide more details on Asia consumer revenues on appendix slide 25. Despite these headwinds most underlying drivers remain positive with average loans up 7% and average deposits up 3% from last year. International credit cost grew 10% year-over-year mostly reflecting portfolio growth and seasoning in Latin America while the net credit loss rate remained broadly favorable at below 200 basis points.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Slide eight shows the results for North America consumer banking. Total revenues were down 5% year-over-year and flat sequentially. Retail banking revenues of $1.2 billion declined by 26% from last year mostly reflecting lower mortgage refinancing activity, and were up 3% sequentially as higher mortgage revenues and improved deposit spreads offset the absence of a onetime $70 million gain in the prior quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Branded cards revenues of 2 billion were up 3% versus last year, as we grew purchase sales and lower average loans were partially offset by an improvement in spreads driven by a reduction in promotional rate balances. And retail services revenues grew 7% from last year, driven by the Best Buy portfolio acquisition. On-going cost reduction initiatives drove total operating expenses down by 4% year-over-year to 2.3 billion even after absorbing the impact of the Best Buy portfolio acquisition.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We continue to resize our North America retail banking business in the second quarter, taking cost out of our mortgage operations and rationalizing the branch footprint all while continuing to grow our franchise. Over the past 12 months, we have sold or closed over 70 branches in North America. During the same period, we grew average retail loans by 11% and average deposits by 4% including 11% growth in checking account balances.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In branded cards, we also saw momentum while total average loans have continued to decline modestly, this mostly reflects the runoff of promotional rate balances. Full rate balances have growth year-over-year for five consecutive quarters, reflecting account growth and increased card usage primarily in our proprietary rewards and travel co-brand products including American advantage where new account growth for our executive card has exceeded our expectations.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Credit remained favorable in the second quarter with net credit losses and delinquencies both improving more than what we had anticipated in branded cards and retail services contributing to a loan loss reserve release of nearly $400 million. At quarter end, our loan loss reverses in North America cards represented roughly 16 months of concurrent NCL coverage.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Slide nine shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail. Overall, global consumer credit trends remained favorable in the second quarter with net credit losses and delinquencies both improving as a percentage of loans. In North America, the strong credit trends I just mentioned drove an improvement in our outlook and we now anticipate the full year NCL rate to be roughly in line with first half results or slightly better than our previous estimate of around 3%. Asia remained stable, and in Latin America, we saw a modest uptick in both NCL and delinquency rates.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">These trends were driven primarily by Mexico cards as that portfolio continued to season and consumers continued to adjust to fiscal reforms as well as the impact of slower economic growth. We continue to expect the full year NCL rate in Latin America to be roughly in line with first half levels. This rate could be higher of course if we incur any losses related to our exposure to homebuilders in Mexico; however, we would expect these losses to be charged against our reserves and therefore they should be neutral to the overall cost of credit.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Slide 10 shows the efficiency ratio for global consumer banking on a trailing 12-month basis. Total franchise results are shown on the light blue line, while the dark blue bars represent the efficiency ratio excluding North America mortgage and Korea. As I\u2019ve mentioned before, revenues have declined in both North America mortgage and Korea over the past year, in addition we encouraged significant repositioning charges in Korea in the second quarter creating a drag on our reported operating efficiency.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Outside of these businesses, we have made steady progress reducing our efficiency ratio to just under 54% as we have exited underperforming markets and simplified our operations. Slide 11, shows our total consumer expenses over the past five quarters, split between core operating expenses and legal and repositioning costs. Legal and repositioning costs were elevated in the second quarter driven by Korea, while core operating expenses continued to decline. We expect to make further progress in reducing core expenses in the second half of the year as we remain on track to achieve or exceed our year-end goals for headcount reduction, card product simplification and branch and support side rationalization.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning now to the institutional clients\u2019 group on slide 12; revenues of $8.5 billion declined 7% from last year and 8% sequentially. Total banking revenues of $4.5 billion grew 6% from last year and 9% from the prior quarter. Excluding the one-time $50 million gain in the prior year, treasury and trade solutions revenues of $2 billion were up 3%, both year-over-year and sequentially as growth in fees and volumes were partially offset by spread compression.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Investment banking revenues of $1.3 billion were up 16% from last year and 27% from the prior quarter, driven by particularly strong debt and equity underwriting activity. M&amp;A revenues improved from the prior quarter and we continue to increase our share of announced M&amp;A volumes in a growing market. Private bank revenues of $656 million grew 2% from last year as growth in client volumes was partially offset by the impact of spread compression and were down 2% sequentially on lower capital markets activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Core lending revenues were $454 million, up from prior periods mostly due to higher average loans. Total markets and security services revenues of $4.1 billion declined 16% year-over-year and 21% sequentially. Fixed income revenues of $3 billion declined 12% from last year as historically low volatility and continued macro uncertainty dampened investor client flows particularly in rates and currencies. In addition, the prior year period benefited from gains as we paired back risk positions given increased volatility in emerging markets. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Sequentially, fixed income revenues declined 22% reflecting seasonal trends. Equities revenues of $659 million were down 26% year-over-year and 25% sequentially reflecting lower client activity, as well as weak trading performance in EMEA in part driven by macro and geopolitical uncertainties in the region.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">In securities services revenues were roughly flat versus last year as increased client activity was offset by a reduction in high margin deposits and up 7% sequentially due to increased client balances and higher activity from new accounts.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Total operating expenses of $4.9 billion were down 2% versus the prior year driven by lower incentive compensation partially offset by higher regulatory and compliance cost and legal and related expenses in the recent quarter. On a sequential basis, expenses decreased by over a $100 million mostly reflecting lower incentive compensation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On slide 13, we show expense and efficiency trends for the institutional business. On a trailing 12 month basis we have lowered our operating expenses every quarter for over two years, driving the full year efficiency ratio from 66% two years ago to 60% as of the second quarter, even as the revenue environment has remained challenging. Our comp ratio for the most recent 12 months was 29% consistent with the full year of 2013.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Slide 14 shows the results for corporate other. Revenues declined year-over-year driven mainly by hedging activities, while expenses increased on higher, legal and related expenses, as well as higher regulatory and compliance cost. Assets of $326 billion included approximately $104 billion of cash and cash equivalents and a $167 billion of liquid investment securities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On slide 15 shows Citi Holdings\u2019 assets which totalled $111 billion at quarter-end, with roughly 60% in North America mortgages. Total assets declined $3 billion during the quarter mostly driven by net pay downs. Roughly $3.8 billion of asset sales were in process during the quarter, but not yet closed as of June 30. These include $2.7 billion of assets from the announced sale of our retail operations in Spain and Greece, as well as nearly $1 billion of mortgage loans, each of which should close in the third quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On slide 16, we show Citi Holdings\u2019 financial results for the quarter. Total revenues of $1.5 billion were up year-over-year primarily driven by the absence of rep and warranty reserve bills in the recent quarter, higher gains on asset sales and lower funding costs. Citi Holdings\u2019 expenses decreased significantly with core operating expenses down 15% in line with the reduction in assets. Net credit losses continued to improve and we released $254 million of loan loss reserves, the vast majority of which was related to North America mortgages.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Looking at the past five quarters of Citi Holdings results on Slide 17; the operating margin in Citi Holdings remained at roughly $700 million this quarter driven in part by gains on asset sales. Credit remained fairly stable and on an adjusted basis, legal cost declined significantly driving Citi Holdings to a profit in the second quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On Slide 18, we show Citigroup\u2019s net interest revenue and margin trends. Net interest revenue was $11.9 billion in the second quarter, up from last year on higher interest earning assets and an improvement in net interest margin and up sequentially driven by day count. Our net interest margin declined sequentially to 287 basis points in the second quarter driven by lower loan and investment yields partially offset by lower cost of funds. We currently believe our net interest margin should remain roughly flat to second quarter levels for the remainder of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On Slide 19, we show our key capital metrics. Despite the impact of the settlement our Basel III tier one common ratio grew to 10.6% as we benefited from DTA utilization during the quarter. Our supplementary leverage ratio also improved to 5.7% and our tangible book value grew to $56.89 per share.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So in summary our results in the second quarter demonstrated further progress on several fronts, while markets revenues reflected the challenging environment, we showed continued momentum in our investment banking franchise and Treasury and Trade solutions continued to grow all while we continued to reduce our total expense base in ICG. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On the consumer side we continued to grow loans, deposits and card purchase sales while reducing our core operating expenses and maintaining overall favorable credit performance. And in Citi Holdings excluding the impact of the settlement we achieved our first profitable quarter and we believe Citi Holdings should remain profitable for the remainder of this year, although with some variability quarter-to-quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Looking to the second half of the year, in markets our results will likely reflect the overall environment. Although we would certainly anticipate that market conditions should be somewhat more favorable than in the second half of 2013. In investment banking revenues will also reflect the overall market, but we feel good about the quality and momentum of our franchise as demonstrated by our performance not only in the second quarter but over the past year. And in Treasury and Trade solutions we believe we can continue growing our revenues in the second half of the year driven by continued volume growth and abating spread headwinds.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Turning to consumer banking; in North America we believe revenue should grow in the second half of the year, both versus the first half of 2014 as well as year-over-year with positive operating leverage. And in international consumer revenue should also grow in the second half of the year. As we move past our repositioning efforts in Korea and the underlying growth of the remaining franchise becomes more apparent.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Turning to expenses; in Citicorp our core operating expenses should continue to decline, although we expect to face on going higher regulatory and compliance costs. Repositioning expenses in the second half of the year should be roughly in line with the first half levels and legal cost will likely remain somewhat elevated and episodic in nature. We continue to have an overall favorable outlook with regard to our credit performance, while we saw an increase in loan loss reserve releases in our North America cards business this quarter, driven better by better than anticipated credit performance. We do expect the reserve releases to be lower in the second half of the year and nominal credit costs in Citicorp could increase as we continue to grow our loan portfolios.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And finally we expect our tax rate for the remainder of the year to be broadly in line with the first half in the range of 32%. And with that Mike and I would be happy to take any questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p7\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">(Operator Instructions). Our first question will come from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">John a few questions, yes, just wanted to follow up on a couple of things you just mentioned. On the legal cost would you expect with the settlement now taking a lot of the mortgage exposure off the table? I assume that legal cost would look more like this quarter where ex-CMBS settlement they seem to come in around 400 million rather than the prior trend which was closer to about 800 million?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Well, let me break it down this way John. I\u2019d say that with the legacy mortgage settlement behind us, we wouldn\u2019t expect holdings to have any significant level of legal charges in the second half of 2014. Now as I said, legal expenses in Citicorp that they are going to remain somewhat elevated and episodic in nature. I wouldn\u2019t expect anything significant.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And this quarter you had about 400 million in Citicorp in which you characterize that as still elevated to $400 million?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">I would say that\u2019s elevated versus what would expect in a normal environment, so we will see where we will go at the second half of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. And then I thought the repositioning expenses will be coming down in the second half of the year after the elevated charge this quarter for Korea. I thought you might have said that last quarter that they will be coming down after this. So, I thought you just said now that they would stay at the first half levels. What would be keeping the repositioning cost so high?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong> </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Well John, we continue to focus our efforts on our operations in the countries that we had identified as optimized markets. And matter of fact if you go back to the conference that we presented at near the end of May, we actually used the slide that showed that we had improved our efficiency ratio by over -- I think it was 300 basis points in those markets during 2013 and we generated further improvements during 2014 through a combination of efforts of branch closures, product rationalization, consolidation of operation and headcount reductions. And we're just going to continue that focus during the balance of this year and given that continued focus we just think it\u2019s more likely that the repositioning reserves for the second half are going to be much more in line with what we had in the first.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. And you mentioned North America consumer expenses likely to improve some more, overall expenses on the core expense face of about 11 billion this quarter companywide. Do you hope to improve from there going forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong> </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">We expect the core expenses to decline sequentially in each of the next two quarters. Obviously, some -- we won\u2019t get as much I think as everybody would like just because of the higher legal and regulatory cost that we're facing but we do anticipate continued sequential decline in the core operating expenses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. And just shifting gears to the DTA utilization. That was a big number this quarter, John and better than expected. The big settlement didn\u2019t seem to have an impact, is that because it wasn\u2019t tax deductible, could you just explain that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong> </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">You have got it, John. The lion\u2019s share of the cost, if you take a look, we talked about taking a pre-tax charge of 3.8 billion and an after tax charge of 3.7 billion, so to your point not much of the settlement cost was tax deductible. And so perhaps the best way to take a look at the performance in the quarter is looking at the results excluding the settlement and there you will see that I think in the first quarter we had $5.9 billion or so of pre-tax earnings and in the second quarter we have roughly the same amount. So, when you are dealing with that level of pre-tax earnings, you are going to get DTA utilization of again somewhere between 700 million, 800 million or 1.1 billion in the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. And that $1.1 billion this quarter contributed to $2.2 billion of Basel III capital build. Could you just explain that on page 36, you show out $1.1 billion led to $2.2 billion of increased Basel III capital?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong> </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yes John that really is tied up in the multiplier effect and it\u2019s a very, very complicated formula that you've got to go through and take a look at not just the level of DTA but first of all what type of DTA. In both the first and the second quarter most of the DTA that we've been able to utilize, has come out of the FTC, those foreign tax credits. So, you start by, that\u2019s immediately dollar-for-dollar reduction because those things just come off the top. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Then between the capital growth as well as the reduction that we've had in things like mortgage servicing rights, we've got even more room now in our 10% buckets as well as the overall 15% bucket. And so you just add up all the various multiplier effects and you end up with that $1.1 billion actually contributing $2.2 billion in regulatory capital.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. Right, you got expansion of the cap, the dynamic cap. Last thing may be Mike, could you comment on the [indiscernible] or any update on the progress you are making understanding the fed\u2019s concerns and what they are asking you to improve and your confidence and the ability to satisfy the high qualitative bar that the regulators are setting?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Sure. What I would say, John, this is Mike, that there is really very little additional information beyond what we've said at the venues along the way but I think to summarize that we still are operating and feel strongly that this isn\u2019t an issue with our business model, our strategy, our levels of capital are clearly our ability to generate capital. Gene and the team are working to continue to enhance and where necessary, build the right (inclusive) [ph] processes in a range of scenarios around the firm. We feel good about the progress. We feel very good about the communication with the fed but its work in progress and we've got more work to do between now and year-end.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question will come from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">A quick question may be just a follow-up on the legal side, you guys settled for $4.5 billion in cash and took a $3.8 billion charge, you only used up $700 million in reserves. Is that effectively a reserve build for what remains and that makes you feel a little bit better about your coverage going forward or is that -- are you only really have $700 million set aside for that, that issue.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong> </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Here Jim, I\u2019m not going to comment on the reserve levels that we have set up for any individual litigation but in the math that you\u2019ve done, you\u2019ve left out the cost of the consumer relief efforts and we do anticipate and have made provision for expense that we will incur in connection with those consumer relief efforts and so that, that estimate is also embedded in the $3.8 billion pre-tax charge that we took.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay, so it\u2019s not just through reserves but also through expense. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"> </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Through the expense that we\u2019ve taken this quarter, yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay, all right.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"> </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">You know Jim, we start with the $4 billion penalty, then you\u2019ve got the $500 million that we\u2019ll pay to the state AGs and the FDI Citi. You add to that the cost of the consumer relief, because there are hard dollar costs associated with the consumer relief efforts and then you subtract out the reserves that we have previously established and that would leave -- that\u2019s what leaves you with the $3.8 billion pre-tax number.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay, fair enough, just a follow up on the expenses and targets, I think we\u2019ve obviously seen revenues come down quite a bit in capital markets year to date, I think you guys, as recently as early June at a conference have been sticking with your targets and I\u2019ve had some questions on how you guys get there with lower revenues, is this part of the reason why restructuring costs are going to remain higher because you\u2019re doing more on the expense side, so I guess they just want to see if that\u2019s right and if you feel still comfortable with your ROA and efficiency ratio targets given where you are right now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"> </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yes, we\u2019re still committed to those targets for 2015 and you know as we said we\u2019re very focused on our execution efforts and in rationalizing the expense base in every one of our businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And so the weaker revenues don\u2019t give you pause.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"> </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Well I mean, I don\u2019t want to be so cavalier about it, Jim to just say that we don\u2019t consider the weaker revenues but we\u2019ve taken all of that into consideration when we say that we\u2019re still committed to those targets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Right, right, okay. No, that\u2019s great, and one last question just on deposit growth, is that very good quarter deposit growth and see corporate Asia has lagged quite a bit in your international side, is that simply a function of Korea or is there something else going there much broad based across Asia that\u2019s limited deposit growth.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"> </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">No, as you know Jim, we\u2019re carefully managing deposit growth and we have been managing deposit growth for some time, you can\u2019t just manage deposit growth at the top of the house, you need to manage it in each country and frankly in each legal vehicle, and so as we look at the liquidity needs for each of our -- each of the countries in which we operate we\u2019re very focused on the level of deposits that we have and importantly the quality of those deposits. So you\u2019re going to see -- you\u2019ll see some regions where we have targeted higher deposit growth than others and it\u2019s really based upon the liquidity needs in each of those regions. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay so it\u2019s just you guys holding it back.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"> </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Well, we\u2019re carefully managing deposits.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay, that\u2019s all I got.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"> </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">You have to manage your balance sheet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">No, I hear you, okay thanks, I appreciate it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"> </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Not a problem.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question will come from the line of Glenn Schorr with ISI.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Hello there, quick in holdings, heard your comments about second half profitability which is cool, I\u2019m just curious, on the net interest revenue side, net interest revenues have increased last three quarters in a row but assets, loans and deposits are obviously shrinking with the whole run off, just curious on how that works.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"> </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Well, we -- there\u2019s yield on assets and then there is cost of funds and we have been -- we\u2019ve been actively managing both sides of that equation, so when you take a look at it you start to lower your cost of funds as you run off assets and that produces the results that you\u2019re looking at.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">That makes sense to me on cost of funds, I\u2019m curious mechanically how that works, is that assigning the relative, meaning when the book is larger and they\u2019re less liquid, it gets a higher cost and as the book gets smaller and more liquid you get a better funding cost, is that the big sling in there, I mean I\u2019m -- it\u2019s like a 150 million, it\u2019s not enormous but it\u2019s just counter intuitive. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"> </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Well it\u2019s the type of funding that you have and the level and certainly the amount of funding that you have in each business as well and you know as the cost of that funding then goes down, you\u2019re going to get a benefit, I don\u2019t know how else to describe it, you know clearly some of the characteristics that you mentioned are driving characteristics, highly illiquid assets have a higher cost of fund -- cost more to fund than liquid assets, so as a book shifts from illiquid to more liquid you\u2019re going to see that we can therefore change the funding problem.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes, I\u2019m good with it, I appreciate it, same kind of com question, inside the equities business you mentioned some of the weaknesses was due to obviously lower volumes, the other part was I think I read a tagline on hedging on the Ukrainian side, produce part of the drop, can you just give a further comment I didn\u2019t see it in the release but I think I saw it online. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"> </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes, no. In the second quarter, and again this is specific to the equities markets, the trading business. In the second quarter we had hedged our equities book in EMEA in anticipation of -- kind of a significant negative market reaction to the Russia, Ukraine situation. Now ultimately that did not materialize to the extent that we have planned for. And so as a consequence, our actions to de-risk the book actually resulted in realized losses during the quarter. So the realized losses that we took in lifting those hedges, equal to about 40% of the revenue decline in that product year-on-year. So we had a -- equities markets were down 26% year-over-year. And so that the de-risking activities actually contribute about 10 full percentage points to that decline.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Got it. Okay. It\u2019s helpful. And then last one, in the FX business, I know this is a hard one, but the slowdown that we\u2019ve seen, the environment obviously volatility has fallen off dramatically, is there any way to tribute how much of that is cyclical obvious of just lower volatility, lower client volumes, lower revenues to changes that have taken place in light of the recent investigations in the market?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"> </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I think that\u2019s going to be really difficult to try to parse out.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">It\u2019s Mike. And I would say couple of things, I think that, again when you think of our FX business there\u2019s a couple of components to it, which in some ways makes it different from others, one is, we\u2019ve got the big transaction processing business and money is coming through the pipes that we process in a regular basis. I think to your question where we\u2019ve seen the real slowdown is on the more active trading. And just that largely being as a result of the lower volatility. So I would view a lot of that as being largely cyclical. And I would expect as volatility comes back, some reasonable portion of that to come back with the volatility.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. That\u2019s exactly what I was looking for. Thanks Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question will come from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Just a question first of all on your reasonable and possible losses with respect to the obviously, the resolution of a lot of issues, can you give us a sense of what that might look like versus last quarter when the (NYSE:<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/Q\" title=\"Quintiles Transnational Holdings Inc.\">Q</a>) [ph] comes out?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">No Guy. We\u2019ll address that when we publish the (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/Q\" title=\"Quintiles Transnational Holdings Inc.\">Q</a>) [ph].</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. Fair enough, thought I'd ask. I wanted to ask you question on the potential for the significant deposit movements in the probably foreseeable future at this point when the FED starts to move your short terms rate higher, it seems like the mechanics are going to be different than they have been in the past for all the reasons that we all know about. And I think we can say that there is a couple of schools of thought, as to what might happen when short term rates go up, one is deposits have really only shrunk a couple of times in the last century or so, it's always been very marginal, so not to worry. And then on the other hand JPMorgan has flagged their view kind of at the other end of the spectrum but maybe this time is different because of mechanics of what the FED\u2019s going to do will be so different and may require a drain of, the FED maybe trillion dollars of bank deposits. As you think about liquidity planning and your internal stress testing, is there anything that you can share with us about the range of best and worst case deposit growth that you might be thinking about?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"> </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes. I am not going to give you a range Guy, but I\u2019ll say this. I\u2019d say that, when you think about the potential impact of the FED\u2019s actions on deposits, one we\u2019re probably less exposed than others on this, don\u2019t forget, we\u2019ve got of our $968 billion of deposits, it\u2019s just a little over $400 billion are domestic deposits. So it\u2019s not the biggest part of our book. And we, as I mentioned in response to one other question, we\u2019ve really been managing our deposit base very carefully over the last few years. And so I think the other thing you need to consider is the quality of an institutions deposit base. And I think that what we\u2019ve been able to achieve is an improvement in our quality of deposits, both internationally but specifically domestically, over the course of the last several years. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">We\u2019re much more focused on and much more concentrated in real operating accounts, we\u2019ve really driven down the level of time deposits that we have in the business. And importantly when you look at with some of the FED\u2019s actions, I think that they are more likely to impact deposits that people take in from financial institutions. And if you\u2019re managing your deposit base in connection with the LCR and NSFR rules, you\u2019re going to be lowering that deposit base anyway so you should be less susceptible to big deposit movements because when the LCR and the NSFR rules deposits associated with financial institutions you get very little if any, credit for the liquidity value of those deposits. So they really bring you nothing as far as managing your overall funding, your overall liquidity. So we\u2019ve been very focused on managing all the aspects of the deposit base over the past couple of years, both as to the nature of the deposits, the liquidity value of those deposits, and really trying to focus on core operating deposits in both retail and corporate customers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Got it. So the follow-up question was going to be how all of this might interact with LCR but it sounds like what you\u2019re saying is that the LCR shouldn\u2019t change very much even with the kinds of flows that might be associated with that type of that activity because they would probably be low LCR credit deposits anyway?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong> </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes, it\u2019s going to be real interesting to see how the FED goes about the next level of managing as far as increasing rates because when you take a look at how monetary policy is going to interact with regulatory policy I think we\u2019re going to end up in a new world that none of us have lived through before nor has the FED.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Great. And then final question from me just on the core equity Tier 1 ratio that as you noted did pick up, that I believe is an advance calculation is that right? And if so, can you just tell us what the standardized was?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong> </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes, the number that we published is the advanced methodology because again our Tier 1 common ratio is lower under advanced and it is currently under standard. I don\u2019t have the standard in front of me Guy, but it\u2019s higher than what the advanced approach [indiscernible].</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay, fair enough. And thanks for the (proponents) [ph] on the deposit outflows, that was very helpful.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong> </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Not a problem.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Couple of questions, one is on the op risks RWAs, you noticed you mentioned at bottom of page 19 that the op risk RWAs are flat Q-on-Q at 288 while for the last few quarters. And I guess I am just wondering does that imply that the kind of settlement that we just had this morning was reflected in your RWA outlook before?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong> </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">That\u2019s our view Betsy that this settlement was already embedded in the increases that we took to the op risk risk weighted assets both in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay, because then when we\u2019re looking at these articles that are out there and obviously we don\u2019t know how much is reflecting of your views but you went in with the lower bid for the settlement than the ultimate final settlement, so I am just trying to square that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong> </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Well, don\u2019t forget it\u2019s a (combination) [ph] but usually impacts op risk is the overall industry more than a particular institution.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay, so you would have thought that like the numbers that you actually came out with was more relevant than what the initial ask was that you might have had for yourself. Is that the way to think about it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong> </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">The way to think about it is really the operational risk environment that the industry is facing and we think that that is really was already embedded in the 288 number.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. And then we\u2026</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong> </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">As of the end of the first quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. And then we also have a couple of more things that still need to get resolved obviously it's been in the headlines for a while, things like LIBOR and FX. And so would those also be embedded within this number as well?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong> </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Based upon everyone\u2019s current views as to what those could be.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. Separate question on the Citicorp corporate other, its page 14. Just want to make sure I understand that expected sustainability of these numbers versus one timers in this quarter revenues down because of hedging activities, maybe to just understand what your thoughts are for that line item, how much did hedging activities impact that, would that have been more like 140 last quarter\u2019s revenue line?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong> </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes, I think when you take a look at corp other, you\u2019re going to get a variation around $100 million from quarter to quarter. Sometimes it will be a little bit less than a $100 million, sometimes it will be a little bit more than a $100 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay, on the revenue side.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong> </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And then on the expenses little bit of higher legal and regulatory compliance, I am just legal sounds like it\u2019s a one timer but reg compliance I am not sure if that\u2019s a one timer or FED just keeps going so how much of that you\u2019re thinking about the expense line now?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong> </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">When you take a look at the first -- I'd take a look at the core operating expenses sequentially and if you look at them sequentially the 284 and the 297 are fairly close.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So legal and repo should fade over the next couple of years is that how to think about there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong> </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Well, certainly repositioning as I said, repositioning cost overall for Citi should be -- the second half should be somewhat in line with what we had in the first half. And legal, as I said, I think that\u2019s going to remain elevated but it\u2019s also going to be somewhat episodic in nature.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And then just lastly on page 11, you have the consumer expense drivers and as of 2Q, in some cases, you've already exceeded what your year-end forecast is; does that suggest year-end forecast will be updated or we\u2019re just running ahead of schedule and the levers for the expense line in global consumer are largely around the support side at this stage?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes, I'd say yes to everything you said. So when you look at some of the drivers, we are running ahead of where we thought we would be clearly on headcount. We didn\u2019t feel that we could update you with the new year-end target at this point in time. So we will likely give you a better view as to where we're going to be at year-end when we come back to you in the third quarter. But obviously it should be lower than the 145 that we are right now. As a matter of fact, if you look at the target we have said it\u2019s going to be less than 145. So if we get less than 145, we'll give you a sense as to how low we think we will be able to drive that next quarter. And I think as far as from a support side point of view that clearly is a big driver of expense in the consumer businesses and that is something that we're very focused on. Good progress in the second quarter, taking those support side down by about 30. And we hope to be able to do that and more in the third and fourth quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And that\u2019s in part the benefit from the project Rainbow?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">In part, it\u2019s Rainbow, it\u2019s also -- we talked about in the past trying to run the consumer business as opposed to a collection of 35 individual consumer businesses, as more of a global consumer bank, and so that clearly has some aspect of it. But there\u2019s also aspect that we can do just in the U.S where in the U.S., we sort of ran the consumer business not as a bank, but as a collection of product silos. And so as we begin to run the U.S. more as a retail bank, that also gives us the ability to close down sites and consolidate.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay, so there should be more income here on the expense outlook?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">That\u2019s what we're saying, yes. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question will come from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Few questions, first, how much was the Ukraine hedging loss?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Well, I didn\u2019t give you an exact dollar amount, Mike, but you can figure it out by the fact that I said it was -- it caused about 10%; so let\u2019s call it just slightly around $100 million or so.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay, and as it relates to Korea, you\u2019re saying the headline should be abating. Can you give us any income figures for Korea or revenues or some additional detail that you don\u2019t disclose in the press release?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I\u2019m not going to go into specifics. We don\u2019t do specific country results. I will tell you this, our view is that -- again, revenues should be now growing sequentially in Korea. Excluding the repositioning charge, for the first time in several quarters, Korea actually turned a pre-tax profit. So again we're encouraged as to the future direction of our consumer franchise in Korea.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">As it relates to expenses, a few people have asked about this, but when I go back to the March 2013 presentation that gave efficiency targets, it said the high end of efficiency assumes flat revenues and revenues for the first half of this year versus last year, down 3%. So once again, why are you still comfortable with your efficiency targets for 2015 when revenues have been so much worse, and you highlighted slide 10 and slide 13, your efficiency targets for global consumer and ICG, just can you confirm that is for the entire year 2015? You still expect to get not only those two targets but for Citi Corp as a whole?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yes, I confirm that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And if I to give -- a very short answer, you've given a lot of things that you\u2019re doing, why can\u2019t you still reach those efficiency targets even though revenues have been so much worse?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Mike, its Mike. I think, as John is going to walk through things, we\u2019ve been taking a multi-pronged approach to the things. So the combination of headcount, support size, tech data information, we've been going across the board at different levers that we can pull to try and keep the expenses in line. And again I think as we think about the second half of the year, certainly on a sequential basis we are feeling better. I think if you look at the underlying drivers and fundamentals of the business, deposits, loans, what\u2019s going on in TTS, what\u2019s going on in the investment banking side of things, despite market challenges, parts of the firm are performing well and we think in the second year there are some continued revenue uplift there, and so again the combination of both levers around the efficiency ratio, the combination of revenue lift with expense discipline gets us to where we need to be. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And I guess the one wallet card is still legal and I know this settlement was lot more than I expected, or was more than almost any shareholder that I spoke with expected. And so if you can just give any additional color. I mean I just read one article saying that Department of Justice didn\u2019t want to hear about your small market share in some of the mortgage areas whereas that seems to be a relevant consideration. So why did you go ahead and settle for what is a huge amount in the minds of many shareholders as opposed to pushing this one? And what does this mean for your remaining legal issues? And what are your remaining legal issues and what do you think about it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I think when you look at our settlement, Mike; there are two components to it. One is the RMBS which has been quantified and then if you\u2019ve got a go down the list of actually fine just on the list in terms of our size in participation. But I think the other side of that is what we did in terms of putting the CDO litigation behind us. And when you go back and you look at our participation and CDOs, you look at 2005, \u201906, \u201907, we were somewhere at or near the top of the lead tables year in and year out in CDOs, and so this was very important to get behind us and I think meaningful. And again as I think, we went through the negotiation, we felt to get this behind us that this was something that was in our shareholders\u2019 best interest to move on from.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And what remains, I assume, FX and LIBOR are the big ones, how should we think about that potential exposure or am I correct in assuming those are the two big remaining legal exposures.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">We don\u2019t comment, Mike, in terms of forward-looking legal.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. And last question. If interest rates increase by a 100 basis points, what\u2019s the benefit to Citigroup today versus say a quarter ago?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">A quarter ago, I think we\u2019ve told you it\u2019s somewhere between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion for a parallel shift in the interest rate move, if interest rates move by a 100 basis points. That\u2019s about a 100 hires (ph) in out somewhere between $1.9 billion and $2 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question will come from the Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Great, thanks. I guess I was sort of wondering when you had spoken at a conference towards the end of May, you had mentioned that you though the entire market\u2019s revenue would be down kind of 20% to 25% and the FICC performance substantially better, and you kind of addressed a little bit around that but, I mean is it as simple as that June was better than the previous months, can you talk a little bit about that maybe put in the context of that current activity for the last couple of weeks and into the third quarter? </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yeah, I\u2019d say that June was certainly a much better month overall from what we had -- the way we had viewed the market performance when we spoke at the conference at the end of May. And there is several events transpired at the end of May, beginning of June that had a common influence on the markets, specifically as it relates to spread products. So everything from the Crimea referendum, everything just sort of seem to calm down. And it was just a better overall environment, as I said, mostly for spread products in the month of June.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Now that\u2019s just kind of continue to show through in July so far.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Again, it\u2019s been just a couple of days in July, let\u2019s not get too carried away. </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. Another question kind of unrelated and that is given the strength of your capital and the high level of capital generation, are there ways that you can actually kind of use that capital position before you have an opportunity to return capital next year? I mean are there activities that you had reduced or stopped doing that you would consider doing again? I mean are there any ways to think about that for the back half of this year just given I mean even the sin buckets, so there are ways to kind of use those just given the strength of that capital position? </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I think Moshe, if you\u2019d go back; I think there is a couple of different ways we potentially think about using it. One is we\u2019re not going to do stupid things with it around putting risk on it doesn\u2019t make sense or doesn\u2019t fit to business model. But I think if you go back, you look at best pie and I think going forward then probably beat the opportunity to take a look at some more portfolios that might come available. And so again we\u2019d take a hard look at those and if they are accretive to the business, we\u2019d be prepared to act on those. </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Clearly we continue in our investor grow markets to grow and whether that\u2019s footprint, clients, balance sheet and so we are putting our capital to work in those areas and I\u2019d say those are probably the two primary things that we\u2019ve looked at in terms of capital use.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Just a follow up on that, Mike. The private label card is an area where there have been a couple of portfolios that are up for sell, any other areas that you would just specifically highlight where you\u2019ve seen kind of opportunities to put capital to work?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I think that the private label card, I think there is potentially some things coming forward in the cards business. John talked a little a bit about. We\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised in terms of the uptake on the American Airlines\u2019 portfolio opportunities to continue to grow organically. But I would say away from those things, Moshe, we are largely focused on what we can do organically around our business model. </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And again you\u2019ve seen both in consumer and both in ICG pretty good loan growth. </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"> </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question will come from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Market.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Market</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Following up on the comments about the good loan growth in ICG group, you guys had very strong corporate lending revenue growth in the quarter can you give us some color where the corporate loan growth is coming from?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Now again it\u2019s pretty widespread, trade products have continued to perform well. We actually saw a slight rise in loan spreads in trade loans this quarter. And we had good uptick from a corporate lending point of view in both Europe and North America. And some of that was related to activity in the capital markets area and M&amp;A, but again it\u2019s been pretty good.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Market</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">The results for the second quarter, in the years past the large banks second quarter results often reflected the Shared National Credit exam, can you give some color to the results reflect -- your results this quarter reflect any changes that the regulators may have had due to the SNC exam and maybe where does that stand right now the SNC exam?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yes, I am not aware that we had to make any significant changes as a result of the Shared National Credit exam.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Market</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Another question sticking with the ICG group, can you guys estimate how much of the fall off in the trading revenues are cyclical versus secular? I know it\u2019s a difficult question, but the volatility is certainly down in this business; hopefully it will come back to drive revenues higher, but can you give us an estimate what you\u2019re thinking might be and then as part of that, are you at a size if it is a secular decline, are you comfortable with the size of your expense base if a part of it is a secular decline?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yes, as you\u2019ve said, Gerard, it\u2019s really hard to come up with an actual number as to what is cyclical versus secular. We continue to evaluate how we view the various offering that we have in those markets businesses and we constantly adjust our capacity to where we think the new secular trend is, so again it\u2019s somewhat product by product as opposed to just say, its markets in general and again its things move based upon market conditions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">You take a look at our FICC revenues for this quarter. FICC revenues were down 12% now that was primarily driven by rates in currencies. And rates in currencies are going to respond to what\u2019s going on in the market. But even in the rates in currencies, rates in currencies were down something close to 30% for the quarter. But you\u2019re looking -- you\u2019re comparing rates in currencies this second quarter compared to the second quarter of \u201913 and second quarter of \u201913 was relatively strong quarter for rates in currencies. And in fact our results in the second quarter benefited from some outside gains that we took as we correctly lowered our inventories in our local markets business in anticipation of increased negative sentiment in the EM associated with the tapering.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So the absence of those prior year gains associated with the de-risking contributed probably a full 6 percentage point to the year-over-year decline in risk in currencies revenues, and so risk in currencies down 23% year-over-year that\u2019s kind of in line with what would I think expect from a seasonal point of view and in the currency environment. So hard to find that there is something dramatically secular going on there. When you look at spread products on the other hand, spread products were up just about 30% year-over-year and basically the entire year-on-year increase occurred in the month of June following the improvement in markets sentiment that I referenced earlier. So you\u2019re still seeing a lot of cyclical that\u2019s running through the year the various businesses at this point.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And I think the second part of your question, if you go to Slide 13, ICG is not standing and watching that if you go back and look at Slide 13, you see the nine consecutive quarters, you see from a core operating expense that the business is taking out about $1.1 billion of operating expense. So again continuing to stay focused on the model when the cyclical versus secular and trying to make sure we\u2019re adjusting to those two pieces.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Market</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Shifting gears moving onto Citi holdings, you\u2019ve gave us some good color about the pending sales that you have in the pipeline and I think you\u2019ve said almost $1 billion of that number come from mortgage loans, what are you seeing in pricing for the distressed assets in the mortgage area, I am assuming it\u2019s improved but by how much?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">It\u2019s improved. I can\u2019t give you an actual figure quarter-on-quarter. I just don\u2019t have it in my head, but it has improved. But again it\u2019s improved, but you have to take a look at those loans broken out by a bunch of different categories and also by the location of the loan, by specific MSA code. So it isn\u2019t as though the entire market is re-priced up by 500 basis points or something like that. It really is product dependent and market dependent. And as you know, we have been very active sellers of these mortgages in the past. So it\u2019s not that we haven\u2019t already gone through this book and done a lot of sales activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Market</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">This is in due putting this mortgage problem behind you with the settlement today, is there ever a reason to do a very large bulk sale in Citi Holdings? And to put it behind you, is that ever feasible?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I think it\u2019s all dependent upon price. If the price was right, we\u2019d be happy to do it. I think based on current market prices and you can see the improvements on the NCLs and you can kind of do your own market check and look at what the market would pay for these assets versus the funding collect out value and today I\u2019d say it\u2019s not there, but if they were to present itself, we\u2019d be happy to react to it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Market</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Would you say it\u2019s extremely wide from what you, in terms of market prices versus what you\u2019re comfortable with or are we within, is it something that within the realm of possibility?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">No I think, again I think as John said, you can\u2019t just take the entire portfolio and lump it because it goes through first through seconds through the deal with CFNA mortgages and all are very different and all have very different pricing characteristics to it. So it\u2019s probably most likely amongst the prime first, you\u2019d get close first and as you move down that spectrum that bid to offer spread so to speak would probably widen out.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">But again, as we look there what we want to sell, it\u2019s not just the headline asset reduction, but more importantly it\u2019s the removal of risk, it\u2019s the removal of cost of servicing and in particular special servicing against these and obviously capital release. So we look at it against what we see the risk-adjusted earnings power of the asset is and if it\u2019s close, we\u2019re happy to move on I would say for a lot of the portfolio today we don\u2019t see that, but not to say it won\u2019t happen some point in the future.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Market</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Great. And then just last question, I may have missed this, I apologize. You guys have moved very swiftly in reducing your branch count here in, globally, but in North America as well. Is there much left to do in North America in terms of reducing the number of branches in the consumer business?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I think you will see continued centralization of our branches around the key metropolitan areas. And again in accordance with our stated strategy where we want to really focus on the large cities. So I still think that there is some level of branch rationalization yet to go.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Your next question will come from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer &amp; Co.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer &amp; Co.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yes, good morning. Earlier in the quarter there were a number of press reports about attempts to sell one main financial and I\u2019m just thinking, does it make sense for Citi to sell a profit-making company for cash, but it can\u2019t return to shareholders? Or is there a way to spin it out to shareholders or what if that got caught up in the whole CCAR process or would it count as a disposition if you did it that way?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Well I think, again kind of going back we in my words crossed the bridge back in 2009 when we placed one main into holdings or at that point Citi Financial into holdings. And while it\u2019s a terrific business, the subprime unsecured lending business is not a business that's core to who we are or our client base for our future.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">So again what we\u2019ve said is, we want to in essence maximize the exit value for our shareholders and we\u2019ve been running that in accordance with that. And I think as we\u2019ve shown in holdings dispositions we\u2019re wide open to different structures, spin sale, different approaches are on the table. And I think as we get closer to kind of looking at that exit, we\u2019ll certainly way all of those.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Your next question will come from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Maybe if we could just step back for a few minutes and talk about the list of strategic priorities, Mike you\u2019ve articulated since you moved into CEO role there was of course the operating expense reduction, the DTA utilization, the resumption of revenue growth across different regions. The reallocation of resources among different global geographies that maybe were under scale and maybe an unspoken one was some of the resizing that occurred in-site, ICG. So I wonder now, where would you say you are like which ending are you in with respect to those various priorities?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Well, I think if you go back and you touched on some, so I think you\u2019ve seen from the efficiency ratio perspective in your operating expenses I think you\u2019ve seen pretty consistent progress against moving towards the target that we set out for the company. I think that when you look at things such as DTA, at the point we really stated the priority of DTA utilization, DTA was still going the wrong way, we\u2019re still increasing. And I think since that point in time we\u2019ve showed the consistent ability to use it. I think the PC didn\u2019t mention in there was we said John and I had put out it by the end of 2015, we wanted to get holdings to breakeven. And I think this quarter got us there a little bit early and it\u2019s our job to work to try and obviously sustain that. And I think candidly the most challenging part of it has really been the revenue side of things, it\u2019s been the environment. I think a combination of the economic, the regulatory and the political nature of things around the world has probably made things more challenging than we certainly would have liked. We\u2019ve tried to continue to adjust the business model to that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">So I think that we\u2019ve made progress on everything that we\u2019ve set out to do, we\u2019ve got more work to do, we\u2019re not going to rest until we get there. But I feel quite good and quite proud of what we\u2019ve managed to accomplish in the last 1.5 years or so.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And you touched on the benefits to reductions from the sale of Greece and Spain. Were there any geographies that sort of moved into the review bucket in the past quarter or two quarters that maybe the market is nowhere?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">No I think, again we showed the optimized list as part of the 2013 exercise, John spoke earlier to the progress against that bucket that in fact we\u2019ve made about 330 basis points of efficiency gains in 2013 and we\u2019ve continued to get those gains in 2014. And what we\u2019ve said I think remains consistent today that we need to have a pathway or a line of vision or a line of sight to those businesses or geographies making sense over the intermediate or longer time frame. And so if we discover businesses or believe their businesses that can\u2019t get there, they\u2019ll absolutely come under strategic review.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And just last question from me on slide 24, the last 12 months return analysis. The 10% that\u2019s listed there and then there is a call-out box, so including the DTA it would be 13%. You changed a little bit from the prior quarter. So I am just curious, would that number have increased the number excluding the DTA? Would that increase sequentially this period?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">No actually on a trailing 12 months basis, because we\u2019ve generated more capital our denominator has increased and therefore has lowered the return.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">So that actually got to the cracks of my question, that the compounding of capital is occurring at a rate faster than what\u2019s occurring in the new areas, effectively correct?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">That\u2019s exactly what\u2019s going on. As I said in the opening in the first half of the year we generated about $10 billion of capital.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">The next question will come from the line of Erica Najarian with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Erica Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">My questions have all been asked and answered.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Your next question will come from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Brian Kleinhanzl - KBW</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I just had a few quick questions here. You said that the revenues in Citi Holdings benefited from the asset sales done there. Can you give us what the dollar impact was from the benefit and it was all to NII?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">If the dollar amount of the asset sales is somewhat similar to the dollar amount that we have disclosed last quarter as far as the benefit of asset sales, which was somewhere in the vicinity of $200 million or so. So it\u2019s roughly flattish to the first quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Brian Kleinhanzl - KBW</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And then off Citi Holdings and the period of loans went down 8 billion, other assets went down about 300 million but the total assets went down 3 billion. What\u2019s the driver of the delta there? Is it organic growth?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">You\u2019re focused on Holdings, right? I just want to make sure. Yes as we sign to sell the businesses in Spain and Greece, they come out of the loan book and they go into assets held for sale. So they move down into other asset category. That\u2019s the way that once you\u2019ve got an asset held for sale, you one line the assets and one line the liabilities of those businesses, and so therefore they come out of loans or whatever other balance sheet line they are in and they all go down to other assets and other liabilities. That\u2019s all.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Brian Kleinhanzl - KBW</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And then within the efficiency ratio that you looked out in the global consumer banking, excluding Korea and mortgage banking would be meaningfully lower. But even if you back out the expenses related to Korea this quarter, still mortgage banking is being a drag on the efficiency ratio. Do you still think that market share gains is enough to improve the efficiency ratio there or do you actually do more repositioning in North America mortgage?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Well we\u2019ve actually have been taking -- the expenses have been coming out of North America mortgages. Now they come out of mortgages on somewhat of a lag basis because you tend to recognize your revenues, especially when you\u2019re doing originate to sell you tend to recognize the revenues when you lock in the rate, when you do a rate lock. And then you still have another quarter where you\u2019ve got to do all the processing in order to really make the sale. But, in general, the expenses have been coming down in North America. We think we have got the, with the expense reductions that we should expect to see in the third quarter, I think that the business is properly sized both from certainly from an expense point of view compared to the level of originations that we would expect to get out of that business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Operator </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Your next question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Ken Usdin - Jefferies </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">John, first on follow-up on Holdings, so the adjusted operating margins gotten up to 700 with the help from that 200 million of gains, is it fair to say that we are now kind of in this new higher range for that operating margin for Citi Holdings or is it still just dependent on whether or not you can get those gains every quarter as you continue to make incremental sales?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">I would say it\u2019s still dependent upon our ability to get those gains, so I would tend to look more of the 100 as the level that we would expect in that business, somewhere between 400 and 500. And if we get a reasonable amount of asset sales then you would get up to the 700 level.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Ken Usdin - Jefferies</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Okay and then secondly on credit quality. This quarter is interesting that the reserve released in consumer and specifically North America card was bigger than it\u2019s been for a while and then conversely the mortgage released in Holdings was actually smaller. So, can you help us dimension, how should we just think about aggregate release going forward and what you anticipate would be the bigger drivers from here?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Clearly the reserve release that we had in cards, as I tried to indicate in some of the remarks that I made, that was really in response to the fact that the credit performance in cards just got a lot better than what we have been anticipating at the end of the first quarter. At the end of the first quarter, we were talking about overall North America NCL rates sort of leveling off at 3% for the year and we just continue to see much more favorable delinquency experience as well as NCL experience in both branded cards and retail services. And we expect that level of NCL and delinquency to continue, so that\u2019s what really drove the reserve release in the second quarter. I don\u2019t expect that the reserve releases in those two cards businesses to stay at the level that we have had in either the first or the second quarter as we move into the second half of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Ken Usdin - Jefferies</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">And then on the mortgage side is it just more dependent on sales from here then it is on credit performance?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">No, if you take a look at just at mortgages, I believe that if you look at the reserve release as a percentage of the NCL that we have took in mortgages, it\u2019s roughly equivalent to where we have been. I think that the reserve release was equal to about 86% of the net credit losses that we had in the Holdings\u2019 mortgage book and we have been running somewhere between 85% and 90% in any of the last several quarters. So, that reserve release is likely going to again somewhere in that 85% to 90% range of the NCLs that we ultimately charge off in mortgages.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Ken Usdin - Jefferies</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Okay and then quick question on the asset yield. So, you mentioned that the NIM should be pretty stable from here, deposit cost look sort of flattened. So, can you talk to us about incremental loan yields and incremental securities purchases and then ability to continue to just grow overall balance sheet in terms of NII dollars?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Our expectation is that loans will continue to grow. I mean we still have loan growth in, again focused on the Citicorp business. Citicorp loans grew 8% year-over-year and we anticipate again still getting good healthy loan growth in our Citicorp businesses. Those loan growth, even if spreads comedown a little bit on loans that still gives you a nice healthy contribution to your near and your NIM. I think you are right as far as deposit cost, I think that\u2019s probably going to be somewhat flattish from here on out may be a slight uptick but not much. But we still have the ability to lower our overall cost of funds as we continue to issue, rollover the long-term debt at more favorable spreads then what we were issuing several years ago.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Ken Usdin - Jefferies</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Okay and then last question on that last point, John. As far as the long-term debt and then also more importantly the continued preferred issuance and I think you guys are still around 70 basis points of B3 RWAs. Can you give us an understanding of just how much of that long-term debt is for roll and then also your general issuance plans on how much of that preferred bucket you want to continue to get on?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">As far as long-term debt, I think we are pretty much at the level certainly of the long-term debt held at the holding company we are pretty much at the level that we think we need to be on a full year basis. And so there will continue to be issuance. We will give you an update on those issuance plans when we do our fixed income conference towards the end of this week but I think it\u2019s pretty much in line with the guidance that we gave out at the end of the first quarter. And we will continue to be an issuer of preferred stock; we recognize that we\u2019ve got some preferred stock issuance to do over the next three to five years, so we will be issuing preferred stock but in a somewhat paced approach.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Operator</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Your next question will come from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Security.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Security</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Good morning, thanks for taking my questions, just a follow up on John, your pretty positive commentary about underwriting strength and M&amp;A strength and I guess I\u2019m trying to get a little more color on was that just in the US or are you gaining, you feel you\u2019re gaining share across the different geographies, Asia, Europe and the US in both those businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">I\u2019d say it\u2019s fairly widespread, obviously it\u2019s going to be a little bit heavier in some geographies than other and I don\u2019t want to get into you know a geography-by-geography commentary. But again it\u2019s a wide spread you know improvement in the second quarter certainly in the wallet share and again as we look to, as the wallet share that we\u2019re capturing in the announced M&amp;A again that\u2019s fairly broad based.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Security</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Okay and then just returning to slide 24, I appreciate the breakout of the average allocated TCE which I presume is going to be updated annually, I guess I\u2019m curious as to the 42 billion of TCE allocated to corp and other, is that going to stay at a roughly similar amount to the total Citigroup capital or could that be moved down into some of the operating units over time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Well when we set up the amount equal to corp other there we laid out the rationale for how we got there, it\u2019s a little bit of the operations that we have in corp other, importantly it\u2019s where we hold the capital associated with the DTA, it\u2019s where we hold some of the operator\u2019s capital that we can\u2019t quite allocate to other businesses and importantly as we continue to generate capital, you know, far in excess of our ability to distribute capital, that amount will grow over time, so we\u2019ll do an annual you know re-appropriation based upon what the level of capital that we think is appropriate for each business, but as long as we continue to be net generators of TCE you\u2019re going to see more of that in the corp other number.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Security</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">And then just finally from me, you mentioned that the impact of a 100 basis point higher rate is slightly more at the end of June then it was at the end of March, I noticed that your securities, your investment portfolio is up about 8% year-over-year or 4% quarter-over-quarter. Can you update on what the estimated reduction in your tangible common equity would be from a 100 basis point higher rate environment. </p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">You know again, we\u2019ll put this all out next, probably when we do the fixed income conference, but my recollection is that it goes to about $3.4 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Operator</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Your next question will come from the line of Derek De Vries with UBS.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Derek De Vries - UBS </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Thanks, I have a couple of questions on Latin America, I guess starting with last week the Mexican Anti Trust Authority published recommendations on reform, I was hoping you could give us some of those key recommendations and maybe talk a little bit about the impact they could have on dynamics.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">I have to tell you we don\u2019t view what was published last week as having any significant near term impact on dynamics, I say that the industry\u2019s still sorting through what was published and it\u2019s still in the early stages of analysis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Derek De Vries - UBS </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Maybe a little more concrete, the provisions in Latin America ticked up, and I take on board your comments about portfolio growth and seasoning, but if there\u2019s nothing sort of one off in nature there, is this a level we should sort of expect going forward from Latin America or is there some one-off things in there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">It\u2019s not necessarily one-off, but again most of the performance and the credit performance in Latin America consumer really is being driven by Mexico cards, and the consumer in Mexico is still absorbing a little bit of the fiscal reform actions that they have gone through and clearly as the Mexico economy continues to struggle to really regain the momentum that everyone thought that it would have, consumer spending has not been robust, so we would anticipate, it\u2019s what he said that the NCO rate will remain relatively high through the end of this year, that\u2019s why we said that Latin America NCO rate will probably stay at around the first half levels but you know, we do believe that once that gets behind us there should be improvement in those NCO rates, as we go into next year, so still feel very good about the overall the underlying credit quality in our Mexico cards portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Derek De Vries - UBS </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">And then I guess one last question just touching on it, I think you\u2019ve had talked about a lot today. The last quarter you said that when you made your 2015 targets you build in about 200 basis points in your efficiency ratio for litigation, so obviously going off a lot from this year, I am just wondering with three months further along, do you still feel comfortable, you\u2019ll get enough of litigation stuff behind you this year at the 200 basis points for litigations. So a good gap as to where you\u2019ll come out next year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Just to be clear, I believe that what I said was that the 200 basis points would cover to both, repositioning as well as legal and related costs. So we\u2019ll have to see as we get closer to the yearend we\u2019ll take a look, but again, we still believe based upon what we look at today that we should be able to achieve the efficiency targets that we set out for 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Your next question will come from the line of Andrew Marquardt with Evercore.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt - Evercore</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Just back on the balance sheet dynamics in a potentially changing rate environment at some point ended deposit velocity question that Guy was getting to earlier. Can you just help us understand if you do have certain level that you baked into your modeling, how do you think about the outcome in terms of may be that -- I mean over half deposits or in fact from ICG group and third is our -- in North America, so it\u2019s still a relatively good contribution total deposits. How you do think about maybe isolating that component that could be at risk in terms of reversal, once raised eventually move higher?</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Yes. Actually we don\u2019t view that component as being at risk because, certainly, I won\u2019t say there wasn\u2019t $1 of deposit but it is at risk but the overall deposit level, we don\u2019t view as being at risk, especially on a TTS businesses, the trend, the treasury and trade, the solutions of deposits, because they really represent for the most part operating account balances. And so those are the funds that businesses need to have in order just to conduct their ongoing operations. So again, we feel relatively good about it, now if the FED tapering or if the FED comes in and does something to try to drain liquidity out of the system that could impact future deposit growth, but it\u2019s not likely to impact the absolute level of deposit that we currently have in those businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt - Evercore</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">And do you have any updated LCR reach it at this point or is that something we should refer not a fixed income call question maybe?</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">That calculation is still ongoing and we\u2019ll give that to you when we do the fixed income call. It still is a very strong ratio. I just don\u2019t have it in front of me right now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt - Evercore</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">The last quarter was about 120-ish, if I recall correctly?</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Yes. It\u2019s going to be just around that maybe even slightly higher, when we publish at this week.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt - Evercore</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Got it. And then just lastly, I know there\u2019s been a lot of questions of interest ratios and goals, but can you just help us understand maybe just to come it down like, if in fact the revenue environment remains to have it and tougher for longer, if the revenue environment is stagnant here, there certainly sounds like there\u2019s room on TCB to move nearly on ICG as well. And efficiency ratio really been met, if the revenue environment today seems as it is for another six quarter or so, is that possible is there enough room on what you have already or would it drive -- you generally think maybe point another something like to draw, that we consider other things?</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Let\u2019s think about the revenue environment that you refer to, all right. We have ongoing revenue growth and has had ongoing revenue growth in Latin America even as Mexico has slowed down. So the revenue environment for Latin America still seems to be in growth mode and we feel very good about the way our franchises position there. When you take a look at Asia, we now have got the Korea repositioning behind us. And we have had underlying growth in each of our franchises in Asia over the last several quarter, but that has been offset in many ways by the reduction in revenues in Korea so we actually are quite constructive as far as the revenue environment today in Asia, Asia consumer has producing growth both sequentially and year-over-year in the second half of the year. So we feel really good about the performance of our Asia consumer franchise going forward. In North America, we\u2019ve got the mortgage repositioning out of the way, so our mortgage revenues stabilized in the first quarter they actually grew in the second quarter, we\u2019ve got that business now positioned properly we think for the way the market should move forward. And again we\u2019re not looking to constantly gain, we don\u2019t look to be number one or number two in that business we just want to be able to serve our customers through our retail branches within appropriate mix of correspondence business. So again we\u2019re very constructive on what we\u2019ve been able to do with the mortgage business. Branded cards I mentioned we\u2019ve got purchase sales growth, we\u2019ve got good underlying momentum in the full rate loans in that business and importantly in the products where we have actually been investing. When you take a look at branded cards, branded cards I think the year-over-year sales growth purchase sales growth was about 5% but if you look at the portfolios where we\u2019ve actually been investing the sales growth there year-over-year is upwards of 8%. So again we feel really good about the momentum and the revenue prospects for branded card. So in our consumer franchises from a revenue momentum point of view we feel good about the revenue momentum.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">And then when you move over to the ICG, we look at the banking franchise and again with the past investments that we\u2019ve made in investment banking we\u2019re doing very well as far as being able to maintain or actually grow wallet share. We\u2019ve had several quarters in a row now of 1 billion or a $1 billion plus revenue quarters. So again we feel good about the revenue momentum in that business. We feel very good about the revenue momentum that we\u2019ve got in transaction services in TTS. 10 quarter, eight quarters in a row, we struggled with spread compression overwhelming the volume growth because of the contribution of volume growth. Now that we see the impact of the spread compression beginning to abate the impact of the volume growth now actually is able to overcome the spread compression. And so we feel really good about the revenue prospects for that business going forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">So then that leaves you with markets. And I think we spend an awful lot of time focused on what\u2019s going on in markets but markets while it\u2019s an important part of our business it is not the largest contributor to our overall revenue picture or our overall profitability. And so I think that there are some legitimate questions going forward as far as markets but the rest of the business I\u2019d say we feel pretty good about the revenue prospects.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt - Evercore</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">That\u2019s helpful, thanks for that summary. And then in terms of in markets and maybe it\u2019s summarized in the ICG when you referenced your I think comp ratio this last quarter was 29% in line with last year. Should we expected that should remain or could it tick higher just because as one referenced earlier as well still trying to figure out how much is cyclical versus secular?</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">The 29% that I referenced is actually the comp ratio over a trailing 12 month basis. So that\u2019s 29% both for full year 2013 and 29% for the last 12 months as measured as of the end of this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt - Evercore</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">And should we expect that for the full year or is that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">I am not going to forecast where comp ratio is going to be but you can see that we\u2019ve been holding in fairly constant.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">Your next question will come from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Steven Chubak - Nomura</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">So one of your competitors provided some helpful disclosure on the advanced approach framework under CCAR specifically which reflected an additional 100 basis point decline in the Firm\u2019s Tier 1 common under stress due to the stressed RWA inflation under the Basel III advanced framework. And since the advanced framework appears to be your binding capital constraint at the moment, I was wondering whether you\u2019ve conducted a similar assessment internally and if so if you could provide some guidance as to how the advanced approach framework could further impact future risk based capital ratios under CCAR?</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">I got to tell you, I have not spent any time looking at what our peer institution put out there, so I apologize.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Steven Chubak - Nomura</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">Have you done the work yourselves though?</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">I am not sure what they did, so I don\u2019t know what they did so I can\u2019t comment as to whether or not we did something similar.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Steven Chubak - Nomura</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">Okay, fair enough. And then switching gears and as a follow up to Betsy\u2019s question on operational risk capital your comments indicated that 56 billion true-up proposed by the Fed or imposed by the Fed late last year, contemplate some buffer for litigation matters not yet resolved. And I was just wondering what the process is for the Fed providing guidance on op risk capital level so is the feedback given quarterly or is it nearly evaluated as part of the advanced model submissions which from what I recall is actually an annual process?</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">Yes, it\u2019s something that is under discussion periodically. But obviously goes through a much fuller exam on an annual basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"><strong>Steven Chubak - Nomura</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">Okay. And then just one more from me on capital allocations, as part of your enhanced segment disclosure on slide 24 the amount of capital allocated exclusive of DTA to support the operations in Corp and Holdings and focusing I guess or excluding the corporate other segment was a combined 126 billion or so which implies on current RWA levels about a 10% Tier 1 common target. And I was wondering if we should think about that 10% Tier 1 common ratio as an appropriate through the cycle target for Citigroup at this juncture or is it simply still too early to make such a determination?</p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">Again when you take a look at the underlying franchises in Citi right now. We clearly think that the Citicorp businesses are capable of producing mid-teens ROTCE, and again that\u2019s going to be -- so the overall firm\u2019s contribution to ROTCE is going to be dependent upon our ability to return capital at some point in time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"><strong>Steven Chubak - Nomura</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">Actually there is one more quick question regarding the DTA disclosure. Can you update us on the level of U.S. foreign tax credits that are subject to expiry by 2018? I know it was about 9.9 billion at the end of the year, but obviously you\u2019ve made some progress over the last two quarters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"><strong>John Gerspach </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">Yes, we update those disclosures on an annual basis. There is just too much movement during individual quarters that actually come up with something that is relevant. So we will update you at the end of this year as to the progress that we have been making.</p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"><strong>Operator </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">You have no further questions at this time. </p>", "<p class=\"p p24\"><strong>Susan Kendall </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p24\">Thank you Regina and thank you all for joining us today.

Today\u2019s call will be hosted by Susan Kendall, Head of Citi Investor Relations. (Operator instructions.) Also this call is being recorded today. If you have any objections please disconnect at this time. Ms. Kendall, you may begin.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Susan Kendall</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you, Brett. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today our CEO Mike Corbat will speak first, then John Gerspach, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation which is available for download on our website, <a href=\"http://www.citigroup.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"><u>www.citigroup.com</u></a>. Afterwards we\u2019ll be happy to take questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Before we get started I would like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation may contain forward-looking statements which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results in capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including without limitation the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of our 2013 Form 10(k). </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">With that said let me turn it over to Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you, Susan. Good morning, everyone. Earlier today we reported earnings of $3.4 billion for Q3 2014. Excluding the impact of CVA/DVA net income was $3.7 billion or $1.15 per share.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Before I address the quarter I\u2019d like to discuss the actions we announced regarding Global Consumer Banking. As you know, we\u2019re committed to simplifying our company and allocating our finite resources to the business where we can generate the best returns for our shareholders. Consistent with these priorities we intend to exit our consumer businesses in eleven markets \u2013 among them Japan, Egypt and Peru. We\u2019ll continue to serve our institutional clients in these markets which remain important to our global network.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">While these consumer franchise have real value we didn\u2019t see a path for meaningful return. We believe our Consumer business will achieve stronger performance by focusing on the countries where our scale and network provide a competitive advantage. Sales processes are already underway in most of these markets and I expect these actions to be substantially completed by the end of 2015. At that point we\u2019ll have reduced our Consumer footprint by 19 markets since 2012 and Global Consumer Banking will be serving 57 million clients across 24 markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">I\u2019d also like to address the announcement we issued earlier this morning regarding a legacy Banamex unit which provided personal security and protective services. While the fraud is not financially material, in light of the conduct we found in the interest of transparency we thought it was best to inform you. As you know we\u2019ve been reviewing our franchise in Mexico and have already made meaningful changes to strengthen our processes and controls, and will continue to take whatever steps are necessary to make sure that every part of our global franchise lives up to the standards all of us rightfully expect.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Now turning to the quarter: we achieved solid performance across our Institutional businesses. Both Banking and Markets saw improved revenue from prior-year period assisted by a better trading environment and a strong M&amp;A pipeline. Treasury and Trade Solution revenues increased slightly despite spread compression. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Global Consumer Banking had a strong quarter as well and saw loan growth throughout the regions. In North America we had revenue improvement in each of our businesses both quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year while we continued to optimize our branch network. Internationally we saw revenue improvements across every region compared to Q3 last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Overall these results show solid business performance which has helped increase Citigroup net income by 5% year-to-date over 2013. We also continue to be focused on reducing the drag on earnings caused by Citi Holdings and consuming DTA. These have been execution priorities and we again made progress on both fronts.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In Citi Holdings we closed the sales of our Consumer businesses in Greece and Spain which helped reduce assets during the quarter by 7% to $103 billion. Holdings assets now constitute only 5% of Citigroup\u2019s balance sheet. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">The Holdings profit of $272 million again helped drive DTA consumption. We utilized $700 million of DTA in the quarter, bringing the total to over $5 billion for the last seven quarters. This contributed to our generating nearly $4 billion of regulatory capital this quarter and growing our Tier One common ratio to 10.7%. Our tangible booked value also increased to $57.73.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">While we\u2019re pleased with our ability to generate capital we\u2019re equally focused on our ability to return it to our shareholders. During the quarter we continued to make progress on our efforts to strengthen our capital planning process. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Most important our capital planning process is being fully embedded in the way we run the firm. This must impact everything, from increased business engagement and enhancements to our forecasting models and scenario design processes \u2013 all of which lead to an improved approach to risk and controls. This work will continue as we get closer to receiving the 2015 stress test scenario from The Fed at which point we\u2019ll prepare a strong submission which reflects the work that has been done.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">As we finish out 2014 we\u2019re very mindful of the challenging macro environment. Geopolitical tensions, uneven growth and concerns over the timing of interest rate increases have increased volatility. While the economy in the US seems to be slowly gaining strength, the Eurozone is not yet in growth mode and emerging market growth has slowed. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">While our expense reduction efforts have been productive we continue to face pressure related to legal costs and the need to invest in regulatory and compliance, as well as the critical need to protect our network from cybercrime. We\u2019ll remain vigilant along each of these fronts to ensure the safety and soundness of our institution.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">John will now go through the deck and then we\u2019d be happy to take your questions. Thank you. John?</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Okay, thank you, Mike, and good morning everyone. Let me briefly review the results of the quarter and then I\u2019ll go into more detail on the strategic actions we announced earlier today.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">To start, I\u2019d like to highlight two items that affect the comparability of this quarter\u2019s results to prior periods. First, CVA/DVA was a negative $371 million pre-tax, or $228 million after-tax this quarter including a $474 million one-time charge due to the implementation of funding valuation adjustments related to certain derivatives. Together these charges had a negative impact on EPS of $0.08 per share this quarter, similar to the CVA/DVA charge last year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">And secondly, last year we recorded a tax benefit of $176 million or $0.06 per share related to the resolution of certain tax audit items. Adjusting for these items, we earned $1.15 per share in the recent quarter compared to $1.02 per share in Q3 last year. Throughout today\u2019s presentation I will be discussing our results excluding these items to provide comparability to prior periods.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On Slide 4 we show total Citigroup results. We earned $3.7 billion in Q3, a 13% increase from last year. Pre-tax earnings of $5.9 billion grew 28% driven by revenue growth and lower credit costs, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses mostly driven by higher legal and repositioning charges. However, our tax rate was higher this quarter at 36%, reflecting a higher level of non-tax deductible legal accruals versus last year as well as higher tax costs related to the sales of our Consumer operations in both Greece and Spain.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On a year-to-date basis, we generated positive operating leverage with modest revenue growth and flat expenses, and our return on assets improved to 83 basis points. In constant dollars, Citigroup end-of-period loans grew slightly year-over-year, to $654 billion, as 4% growth in Citicorp was partially offset by the continued decline in Citi Holdings. And deposits were flat at $943 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On Slide 5 we show more detail on expenses. Legal and related and repositioning costs totaled over $1.3 billion in Q3, mostly incurred in Citicorp. We also incurred $59 million of operating expenses related to the sales of our Consumer operations in Greece and Spain this quarter. Excluding these items core operating expenses of nearly $11 billion in Q3 increased by roughly $100 million versus prior periods, primarily reflecting an adjustment to incentive compensation expense driven by better-than-anticipated performance year-to-date in our Institutional franchise. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Higher regulatory and compliance costs, including those related to CECCAR and the impact of business growth were more than offset by continued cost reduction initiatives as well as the decline in Citi Holdings assets. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We expect to incur an incremental $150 million to $175 million of costs in full-year 2014 as we work to enhance our capital planning process. We estimate that about one-third of that amount will be non-recurring. In 2014, the incremental CECCAR-related costs will be more heavily weighted to the back half of the year. In Q3 we spent an incremental $60 million related to the CECCAR process and we expect this amount to increase further in Q4.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On Slide 6 we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Citicorp\u2019s pre-tax earnings grew 13% as higher revenues across the franchise and lower credit costs were partially offset by an increase in operating expenses. Citicorp expense growth was mostly driven by higher legal and repositioning costs, the adjustment to incentive compensation and ICG, and higher regulatory and compliance costs partially offset by efficiency savings. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In Citi Holdings we were profitable again this quarter with over $270 million in net income compared to a loss of over $100 million last year, driven primarily by lower legal and related expenses. Citi Holdings ended the quarter with $103 billion of assets or 5% of total Citigroup assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Before I go into more detail on Citicorp I\u2019d like to cover the strategic actions Mike discussed earlier which will streamline and simplify our Consumer operations. We are exiting our Consumer operations in eleven markets plus our Consumer Finance business in Korea. As you can see on Slide 7 these actions include markets across Latin America, Asia and AMEA. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Substantially all of these operations were previously classified as \u201coptimized markets\u201d in our country bucketing framework, and while we have made steady progress in many of these businesses we ultimately determined that our scale did not provide for meaningful returns. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We already have active sales processes underway for over half of the businesses and we currently expect the strategic actions to be substantially completed by the end of 2015. We expect to report these Consumer operations as part of Citi Holdings as of Q1. We will continue to serve our Institutional clients in these countries which remain important to our global network.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On Slide 8 we provide details on the financial impact of these actions, showing Citicorp on the left and Global Consumer Banking on the right. Over the last twelve months these businesses contributed over $1.6 billion of revenues and $34 million of net income. Total assets were $29 billion as of the end of Q3 including $7 billion of consumer loans; and total deposits were $26 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As shown on the far right, on a pro forma basis our Global Consumer Banking business would continue to capture more than 95% of our existing revenue base while further simplifying our operations and improving our performance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Now, turning back to Q3, on Slide 9 we show actual results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. Net income grew 22% year-over-year in Q3 driven by higher revenues and lower credit costs, partially offset by higher legal and repositioning charges. Revenues grew 5% year-over-year in Q3 driven by continued volume growth across the franchise with average loans up 5% and average deposits up 3%; a rebound in investment sales revenues in Asia; and a reduced impact from our repositioning efforts in Korea.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Core operating expenses excluding legal and repositioning costs were roughly flat as ongoing efficiency savings offset the impact of business growth as well as higher regulatory and compliance costs. International credit costs declined 13% year-over-year driven by a net loan loss reserve release in the current quarter, while the net credit loss rate remained broadly favorable at just under 200 basis points.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Slide 10 shows the results for North America Consumer Banking. Net income grew 33% year-over-year this quarter driven by higher revenues, lower operating expenses, and continued favorable credit trends. Total revenues were up 5% year-over-year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Retail Banking revenues of $1.2 billion grew 9% from last year, reflecting continued volume growth and abating spread headwinds as well as a mortgage repurchase reserve release of roughly $50 million this quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Branded cards revenues of $2.1 billion were up 1% versus last year as we grew purchase sales and an improvement in spreads mostly offset the impact of lower average loans. And Retail Services revenues grew 8% from last year, mostly driven by the BestBuy portfolio acquisition.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Ongoing cost reduction initiatives drove total operating expenses down slightly year-over-year to $2.4 billion even after absorbing the impact of the BestBuy portfolio acquisition and higher legal and repositioning expenses. We continued to resize our North America Retail Banking business in Q3, taking costs out of our mortgage operations and rationalizing the branch footprint, all while continuing to grow our franchise.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Over the past twelve months we have sold or closed nearly 90 branches in North America. During this same period we grew average retail loans by 9% and average deposits by 2% including 10% growth in checking account balances. We also continued to see momentum in branded cards. While total average loans have continued to decline modestly this mostly reflects the runoff of promotional rate balances. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Full rate balances have grown year-over-year for six consecutive quarters and we continue to see strong growth in accounts and purchase sales in our proprietary Rewards and Travel co-brand products. We also launched our Double Cash card this quarter, which rounds out our product portfolio in the important cash-back segment. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Slide 11 shows our Global Consumer Credit trends in more detail. Overall Global Consumer Credit trends remained favorable in Q3, with net credit losses and delinquencies both improving as a percentage of loans. In North America the NCL rate continued to improve while 90+ day delinquency rates were flat. Asia remained stable, and in Latin America we saw a modest uptick in the NCL rate while the delinquency rate improved slightly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Net credit losses grew broadly in line with our expectations in Q3 driven by portfolio growth and continued seasoning in the Mexico cards portfolio as well as the impact of both slower economic growth and fiscal reforms in that market. However, our overall loan growth was slower than anticipated which had a negative impact on the NCL rate for the quarter. This slower loan growth reflected the overall economic environment as well as a higher level of prepayments in our mortgage portfolio. Looking to Q4 we expect the dollar amount of net credit losses in Latin America to be more or less stable.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Slide 12 shows the expense and efficiency trends for Global Consumer Banking on a trailing twelve-month basis. While annual expenses increased in late 2012 and early 2013, driven in part by higher North America mortgage activity, we have driven down the core expense base over the last five quarters even as we have absorbed the impact of higher expenses associated with the BestBuy portfolio acquisition. Including roughly $800 million of legal and repositioning charges over the last year, our total efficiency ratio for Global Consumer Banking was 56%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Slide 13 shows our total Consumer expenses over the past five quarters split between core operating expenses and legal and repositioning costs. Core expenses continued to decline on a sequential basis in Q3 as we made further progress towards our year-end goals for headcount reduction, card product simplification, and branch and support site rationalization. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on Slide 14, net income grew 29% year-over-year driven by higher revenues partially offset by higher operating expenses. Revenues of $8.7 billion grew 13% from last year and 2% sequentially. Total Banking revenues of $4.3 billion grew 11% from last year and were down 3% from the prior quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2 billion were up 1% year-over-year as growth in fees and volumes was partially offset by spread compression. Sequentially, revenues declined by 2% driven by lower trade assets and spreads.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Investment Banking revenues of $1.2 billion were up 32% from last year driven by strong M&amp;A and equity underwriting activity, and down 7% from the prior quarter as continued momentum in M&amp;A was more than offset by seasonally lower underwriting volumes. Private Bank revenues of $663 million grew 8% from last year as growth in client volumes was partially offset by the impact of spread compression.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Corporate Lending revenues were $442 million, up 17% from last year reflecting growth in average loans and improved funding costs partially offset by lower loan yields and down 3% from last quarter on lower gains from asset sales. Total Markets and Securities Services revenues of $4.3 billion grew 8% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Fixed Income revenues of $3 billion grew 5% from last year driven by strength in securitized products as well as an increase in foreign exchange volatility and volumes which benefited our Rates and Currencies business in the month of September. Sequentially, Fixed Income revenues were down slightly as a seasonal decline in spread product revenues was mostly offset by strength in rates and currencies.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Equities revenues of $763 million grew 14% year-over-year driven by improved client activity in derivatives, and were up 16% sequentially on better trading performance. In Securities Services revenues grew 8% year-over-year driven by an increase in client balances and activity. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Total operating expenses of $5 billion grew 3% over prior periods, driven by the compensation adjustment, higher regulatory and compliance costs, and higher repositioning charges partially offset by ongoing efficiency savings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On Slide 15 we show expense and efficiency trends for the Institutional business. On a trailing twelve-month basis, the efficiency ratio declined to 59% this quarter despite continued elevated legal and repositioning charges. And our comp ratio for the last twelve months was 28%, down from 29% last quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Slide 16 shows the results for Corp. Other. Revenues declined year-over-year driven mainly by hedging activities while expenses increased on higher legal and related expenses as well as higher regulatory and compliance costs, including those related to the CECCAR process. Assets of $332 billion included approximately $97 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $180 billion of liquid investment securities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Slide 17 shows Citi Holdings assets, which totaled $103 billion at quarter-end with over 60% in North America mortgages. Total assets declined $8 billion during the quarter driven by net pay downs and divestitures including the sales of our Consumer operations in both Greece and Spain. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On Slide 18 we show Citi Holdings financial results for the quarter. Total revenues of $1.6 billion were up year-over-year, primarily driven on gains on the sales of our Consumer operations in both Greece and Spain and lower funding costs, partially offset by losses on the redemption of debt used to fund Holdings assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Citi Holdings expenses decreased significantly, driven by the lower level of assets as well as lower legal and related costs partially offset by $59 million of episodic expenses related to the sales of our Consumer operations in Greece and Spain. Net Credit losses continued to improve, down 45% year-over-year, driven by North America mortgages. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">And we offset all of the mortgage net Credit losses with loan loss reserve releases. The net loan loss reserve release of $144 million includes the impact of roughly $75million of losses on assets moved to held for sale this quarter. Excluding these losses, the reserve release would have been close to $220 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On Slide 19 we show Citigroup\u2019s net interest revenue and margin trends. Our net interest margin improved to 291 basis points in Q3 reflecting lower cost of funds. Looking to Q4, given the sale of Consumer loans with attractive margins in Greece and Spain we could see our net interest margin decline by a basis point or two.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On Slide 20 we show our key capital metrics. During the quarter our Basil-3 Tier One common ratio grew to 10.7%, driven by net earnings and continued DTA utilization. Our supplementary leverage ratio also improved to 6.0%, with about half of the sequential increase due to the impact of the revised final US Rules. And our tangible book value grew to $57.73 per share.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">In summary, our results in Q3 demonstrated momentum across the firm. In Consumer Banking we grew revenues, loans and deposits in every region resulting in positive operating leverage and strong income growth over last year. And in our Institutional franchise we saw broad revenue growth across Markets, Investment Banking and Treasury and Trade Solutions, also resulting in positive operating leverage and significant growth in net income.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">In Citi Holdings we were profitable again this quarter while continuing to wind down the remaining assets in an economically rational manner. And we continued to grow our book and regulatory capital. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Looking to Q4, in Consumer Banking we expect to continue growing our revenues while maintaining positive operating leverage year-over-year. In Markets our results will likely reflect the overall environment as well as normal seasonal trends. In Investment Banking, revenues should also reflect the overall market but we feel good about the quality and momentum of our franchise as demonstrated by our performance. And in Treasury and Trade Solutions we believe we can continue growing our revenues year-over-year in Q4 driven by continued volume growth and abating spread headwinds.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Turning to expenses, in Citicorp our core operating expenses should be relatively flat to Q3 levels as we expect to continue to face ongoing higher regulatory and compliance costs, including those related to our enhanced capital planning process. Repositioning expenses should be more or less in line with the roughly $400 million we incurred in Q3, and legal costs will likely remain elevated and episodic in nature.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">We continue to have an overall favorable outlook with regard to our Credit performance. And finally, we expect our tax rate for Q4 to be broadly in line with the first half of the year in the range of 32%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">With that Mike and I would be happy to take any questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"></p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p7\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">(Operator instructions.) Your first question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Jim Mitchell \u2013 Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Hey, good morning guys. I appreciate the sort of disclosure on Mexico \u2013 obviously that\u2019s been a focus of investors. Obviously you\u2019ve probably done a very thorough review. Can you give us a sense of how you feel about just overall risks \u2013 people talk about AML issues or worries about that? As you\u2019ve gone through the process can you give us some comfort level there? And then I guess taking a step back, second question being as you reduce complexity by getting out of eleven more markets, potentially getting rid of One Main, how do you feel that helps you going into CECCAR next year? Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Sure. Jim, I think from a Mexico perspective we said as part of OSA we were going to embark on a comprehensive review of our policies and processes. That review is significantly underway; I think we\u2019ve made some meaningful changes to the way we come to work and think about things in Mexico. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">We continue to be focused on those things and again are committed to getting the franchise to the right place. It\u2019s an important franchise for us in every sense of the word and a place where we think there\u2019s growth and a place where we need to and should be making investment; and we\u2019ve got to get those things right, and we\u2019re committed to do that. And we\u2019ve put a lot of resources forward both locally and from around the globe to help us be able to do that as quickly as we can.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">I think from a complexity perspective, I think two things \u2013 one is you hit on part of it, and John and I talked about it: these eleven Consumer markets plus the Korean piece were those that were in the optimized bucket. They were those that we were working with the businesses on in terms of trying to create a pathway to proper returns. We didn\u2019t in the end see that in these, and so I think in many ways these decisions were made around a couple axis. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">One is that we didn\u2019t see the prospect to getting to adequate returns in a reasonable period of time. Second, we felt that we could take those resources and we could reallocate them into other parts of our business where we would certainly have the ability to try and get more out of them. And I think the third piece you touch on is around those: if you don\u2019t have a pathway to that it doesn\u2019t make sense to keep complexity or keep things in the firm that aren\u2019t going to be able to touch those. So I think we were able to tick off several boxes by making these moves.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Jim Mitchell \u2013 Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Right, makes sense. And I think with these sales though it seems like it helps profitability. Does that give you more comfort on the ROA target? And then just a quick clarification, your ROA target of 90 basis points includes Citi Holdings and that contemplates, I\u2019ve had some questions around the selling of One Main and what that may do to your targets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. Yes, and so the ROA target includes Citi Holdings so that\u2019ll be there to begin. We\u2019ve put all the caveats around big gains or losses that are outsized, etc., but that\u2019s there. And again, I think you can see in these moves \u2013 and again, as we\u2019ve described we\u2019re going to move these businesses into Citi Holdings; and in Citi Holdings I think we\u2019ve proven that we\u2019ve got the people and the expertise that can manage these exits well. And we don\u2019t want our go forward businesses distracted in that process, and again, we\u2019ve already started the process against most of those and have an expectation that we\u2019d like to be out of the majority of those by the end of \u201915.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Jim Mitchell \u2013 Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">But otherwise you still feel comfortable with the target even if you sell a profitable business like One Main?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">We do, yes we do.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Jim Mitchell \u2013 Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay great, appreciate it. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thanks. Following up on the targets, John and Mike, I was wondering how you\u2019re feeling on the Consumer Bank, on the GCB targets for efficiency ratio on Slide 12. John talked about the target and you give the helpful box there. The 49% to 52% efficiency target seems like a stretch from the pro forma 55%. Can you help us feel better about kind of what are some of the drivers there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Sure, John. When you take a look at that slide I think you\u2019ll notice that at the top of the slide there\u2019s a blue box that has the repositioning charges and legal charges of $800 million, and that both the 56% and the 55% figures include what we would think of as being rather outsized repositioning and legal charges on a trailing twelve-month basis. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So that, I think you\u2019ve got two things. One is, as you can see with the dark blue boxes both on this slide as well as the next slide, we are continuing to drive down the core operating expenses in the business. But at the same time then I don\u2019t think that we\u2019ll see the same level of repositioning charges going into 2015 that we\u2019ve seen during 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And John, did you mention that there will be any repositioning charges for the simplification you described today? Or is that a driver for the $400 million that you talked about for Q4?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I\u2019m sorry, John, I missed the beginning part of your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I was just wondering what repositioning expenses might be associated with the strategic actions you announced today.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Nothing specific in that $400 million related to the eleven markets. Those things, whether or not we have repositioning charges associate with that will really be determined based upon the structure of whatever deal that we negotiate on a sale. So it\u2019s a little early to call that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. And then just to clarify the CECCAR expenses, you mentioned incremental costs of $100 million to $150 million in 2014 over 2013?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Correct. John, $150 million to $175 million is the number that I quoted.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay, and you spent $60 million or so this quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">We spent an incremental $60 million year-over-year this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And was there any in the first half of the year that would count towards that $150 million?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yeah, there was some. Certainly beginning in Q2, I don\u2019t have that number right in front of me but it would have been much less than the $60 million that we had in Q3. And we expect those expenses then to continue to ramp up into Q4.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Got it, okay, so we can kind of put the pieces together there. And then you said one-third of it you expect to be nonrecurring?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. Okay, and then just on Credit, John, you had the reserve release in International Consumer. What drove that and how are you feeling about reserve releases continuing in the other parts of the businesses, domestically in Citicorp and then also in Holdings?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yeah, I\u2019d say that we\u2019re still seeing, well first as far as from an international point of view that was largely driven by Asia but also by continuing favorable credit trends throughout the countries with the exception of where I called out the NCL rate issue that we have in Mexico \u2013 although again, the dollar losses there of net credit losses were largely in line with our expectations. It\u2019s much more of a rate issue.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">We continue to see real favorable credit in North America, certainly in both our mortgage business but importantly in both of our cards businesses \u2013 Branded Cards as well as Retail Services. So that story is still continuing. When I look at the net credit margin which I think you see it in the supplement \u2013 the net credit margin in our Branded Cards business this quarter was over 950 basis points. So that\u2019s really outstanding performance in that US Branded Cards business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">How should we think about whether we\u2019re likely to see some reserve releases in Card or in the mortgage part of Holdings going forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Well the mortgages, as far as from a holdings point of view, John, you can pretty much expect that we\u2019re going to be you know largely netting off reserve releases against the NCLs that come out of mortgages. You know, this quarter it was just about 100%, I think it was like 101%. Last quarter we were in the 90% range, so you\u2019re going to see a large portion of whatever losses we take in the mortgage book in Holdings offset by reserve releases.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">As far as the rest of the world I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see much more in the way of reserve releases coming out of our International Consumer operations. We continue to grow those books and so just as you continue to grow the loan book you\u2019re going to have to build loan loss reserves against that. And then in the US it\u2019s really going to be driven by just how much better our credit performance can get in our two Cards businesses. You might still see some reserve releases in the near quarters but I wouldn\u2019t look out much past that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with ISI. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thank you. Maybe just a little color on timing and what drove the one-time implementation of the FVA on the over-the-counter derivatives that you mentioned \u2013 I think you have the bullet on Slide 3.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yeah, this is something that we\u2019ve been looking at for some time. There\u2019s been a couple of other institutions that have adopted it so it\u2019s been something that\u2019s been knocking around in the market. We\u2019d set ourselves a goal to adopt it sometime during 2014, as soon as we could get all the systems in place and we had the ability to monitor this type of calculation over several months, a full quarter. And so we had gotten everything in place and we felt comfortable then pulling the trigger on the formal adoption in Q3 instead of waiting until Q4. We think it\u2019s the way the industry is going and therefore we wanted to adopt it as soon as we felt comfortable that we had the systems in place to track it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay, and is the one-time [catch-up], and like you said \u2013 some people have adopted it, some haven\u2019t. And you expect everybody through by year-end?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I don\u2019t know by year-end but I do think that over time, and I don\u2019t know whether time is this year-end or next year-end, I think the move is to go that way. And we just felt it was better to be at least in the middle of the pack.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Got it, okay. We can move on, thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">No problem.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">You\u2019ve had a big benefit as others have as lower average rate on long-term debt, and that\u2019s been a driver of your stable and actually even growing margin. So I heard your comments about the one or two basis points, I\u2019m not overly focused on that, but my one question is going forward in terms of debt coming due and all thoughts around TLAC how much more optimization do you see coming in say the next two years on the cost of financing, impact on margin and then where you fit in TLAC in general?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay, that\u2019s a very broad question. That\u2019s okay, that\u2019s alright, it\u2019s a great question but let me just try to break it down into pieces. So let me start I guess with TLAC is probably, because again we still don\u2019t know where TLAC is going to come out. We\u2019ve all seen the rumors and everything else but we haven\u2019t seen the formal rules yet so it\u2019s a little hard to judge exactly what\u2019s going to be implemented with TLAC. But from a TLAC point of view right now, we would put our loss absorbent capital at just over 20% of our risk-weighted assets. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Now that\u2019s again our calculation based upon our interpretation of the rules, and in order to get to that 20% for instance we have eliminated all of the structured notes we issue as saying we think that they\u2019ll be ultimately kept out of the rule. That may be right, that may be wrong but that\u2019s what gets us to that little bit over 20%. So we feel like we\u2019re okay with TLAC, but obviously there\u2019ll be more work to do and we\u2019ll have to see again how the rules come out. So let\u2019s put the response to TLAC aside just for a second.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And then when you take a look at our existing book, you know, I still think that there is some optimization work that we can do on the liability side of our balance sheet. Don\u2019t forget we still have debt that we\u2019re carrying that was issued in \u201907, \u201908, \u201909, \u201910 when our credit spreads were much higher than they are today. And so as that debt runs off that can still give you some lift.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Maybe the other side of the equation is I\u2019ve noticed growth in international markets has been good on the loan side. The deposit growth has been less impressive and I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s something that you\u2019re doing consciously or just a product of some of the markets that you\u2019re in. Just curious on\u2026</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Glenn, what you\u2019re seeing is we are active managers of our balance sheet and again, you\u2019ll notice that. Especially take a look at the US Cards business \u2013 I mentioned that before. You\u2019ll see there that we\u2019ve actually been driving up yields in the US Cards business. As we\u2019ve let those promotional balances run off we\u2019ve actually experienced higher yields than on those interest-earning assets. So I don\u2019t want you to think that everything we\u2019re doing is just on the right-hand side of the balance sheet; we\u2019re actively moving on the left-hand side of the balance sheet as well as we think about driving our NIM performance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">But to your other question then on deposits, yes, we\u2019re active managers of our deposit base as well. And we\u2019re looking to run what we would term a \u2018compact\u2019 balance sheet. We\u2019re not looking to grow the balance sheet much beyond where it is today. We don\u2019t think we need a balance sheet much larger than $1.9 trillion to serve our clients. And so within that construct then you need to be very careful about both what you put on the left side of the balance sheet and how you fund that on the right side of the balance sheet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And so when you deal with all the rules that are out there as far as net stable funding ratio, the LCR, the SLR \u2013 all of those rules come into play as we think about how to structure the right side of the balance sheet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay, maybe just a really quick wrap-up. We definitely appreciate Slide 8 on the impact of the strategic actions. Are we looking at that slide each quarter as we roll through \u201915 or is there chance you move those eleven markets in something like discontinued ops and we get a clean look at Citicorp without it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">No, Glenn, one of the things that we mentioned is that effective Q1 we\u2019ll move those eleven markets into Holdings so that we will give you a clean look at the GCB. We\u2019ll show it on a pro forma basis again next quarter but then beginning in Q1 we\u2019ll give you a clean look at the Global Consumer Bank.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Thank you, missed that one. Appreciate it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">That\u2019s not a problem, sir.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Hi, good afternoon. So first one, just a quick one, I don\u2019t know whether you can comment \u2013 JP Morgan gave us a little bit on the source of it. The legal charge, is it possible to say what that\u2019s tied to? I think JP Morgan indicated it was heavily tied to FX.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yeah, Brennan, as you know we typically don\u2019t comment on reserving actions unless it\u2019s related to a specific settlement that we\u2019re announcing. So that\u2019s as far as we\u2019re going to go today.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. And then on the funding side, I believe you had said that funding costs drove the NIM expansion. Can maybe you give a bit more color on specifically what was behind that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Again, as we manage both the cost of our deposits as well as the cost of our debt, we\u2019ve managed to improve the cost of funds. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s giving you enough or if you need something, but the improvement was just about evenly split between the two. And so that\u2019s actively managing deposits \u2013 we\u2019re managing down things like time deposits and instead concentrating on getting deposit growth in operating balances, which are either interest-free or interest-light. And then on the long-term debt, again we\u2019re swapping out debt where we had issued it under higher credit spreads and replacing it with debt that is a bit more attractive to us today.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yeah, sorry, I meant is there any geography impact there or anything beyond just shifting away from time deposits?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Well, from a geography point of view most of the debt would be US-centric and the deposits would be a global phenomenon.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. And then thinking about your rate shock scenario, can you give any color about how that might look in Year 2 or how you might think about that in Year 2? Just trying to think about the benefit from rolling the portfolio into higher-yielding securities versus your expectation for deposit pricing pressure.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yeah, when we put out the $1.9 billion impact that really is, it\u2019s a rate shock type of thing. So it\u2019s an estimate as to what the revenue impact would be to the firm over a year if rates just moved instantaneously by 100 basis points. Now, obviously then as you begin to operate in that environment there\u2019d be a lot of moving pieces and give and take, but I would say that for the most part that $1.9 billion should be sustaining into Year 2. You might have some changes a little bit around the edges but it should be largely sustaining.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay, and I guess so effectively the benefit from rolling into higher rates would probably be largely offset by increasing deposit pricing?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yeah, if you\u2019re in a rising rate environment again it\u2019s going to certainly impact both sides of your balance sheet. That\u2019s why I say it would be largely sustaining.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay, terrific. And then the last one with me, is it possible to get a rough idea of the cost basis of One Main?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">No.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Alright, figured I\u2019d give it a shot. Thanks a lot.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">That\u2019s okay, Brennan, thanks a lot.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Hi gentlemen. So you announced what sounded like very logical moves on the Global Consumer side. I was wondering if you could give us a sense for the capital free-up potential \u2013 what\u2019s either your capital allocated to those markets or the RWA impact?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Not at this point in time, Guy. We\u2019ve given you the capital attribution for the overall Consumer business and we\u2019ll refresh that in Q1, and when we refresh that in Q1 you\u2019ll see the impact from those exits as well as other changes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay, fair enough. When you think about what you\u2019ve been doing to try to get a more positive CECCAR outcome next time I was wondering if you have had some discussions with the regulators about how they would view this type of strategic action that you\u2019re taking?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Sure, Guy, it\u2019s Mike. Obviously we\u2019re in pretty constant and consistent dialog with the regulators. I think in there the business model and the running of the business is our decision in terms of what we want to do, and provided that we can show we\u2019ve got the ability to run it in the right way they\u2019re fine with that. I think to the earlier question, in this case given that these aren\u2019t and in the immediate case we don\u2019t see a path to being accretive for our shareholders it\u2019ll certainly work towards a smaller, simpler Consumer business, a more focused Consumer business. And in the end I think taking those factors, you\u2019ve got to view that as a positive. But the regulators haven\u2019t commented specifically on it. </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Got it. Just a question on the DTA utilization: the level you did in the quarter was kind of comparable to what you did last year on a quarterly basis but I think in the first half you had been running more around $1.1 billion. I was just wondering mechanically maybe you can explain to us why it fell off.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yeah, really it has to do, Guy, with everything. Earnings has been fairly consistent, so if you look at the earnings impact over the last couple quarters, our earnings \u2013 both coming out of Citicorp as well as Citi Holdings \u2013 have been running at about $800 million a quarter; I think one quarter it hit $900 million. So the real change from what we were running in the first half to what we ran in the second really has to do with the impact of CVA and OCI and it\u2019s as simple as that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">But the earnings potential, if you go into the back of the deck, Page 39, there you\u2019ll see that for a trailing twelve-month period the earnings of Corp and Holdings utilized $3.4 billion of DTA. Now on a year-to-date basis that similar number is $2.6 billion and in the quarter it was $800 million. So again, very consistent at $800 million, $900 million a quarter, the earnings power of the franchise begins to utilize the DTA. It\u2019s the other stuff \u2013 it\u2019s how the OCI moves that gives you a little bit of noise that you see over there on the right side. For a full year the impact of all of that was $200 million of utilization but you\u2019re going to get noise quarter to quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Got it. So the noise is going to depend on what happens to your credit spreads and those of your counterparties, and OCI \u2013 in other words, rates. And so you\u2019re really not going to know about that until the end of the quarter, basically.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">That\u2019s exactly right, Guy. And again, that\u2019s going to be some noise but I think that the number you really want to focus on is how are we doing as far as utilizing DTA driven by the earnings capacity of the franchise.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yeah, understood. Absolutely. JPM called out emerging markets\u2019 revenue in [FIC] as a driver of the relative strength in the quarter and I was kind of surprised that you didn\u2019t, that you indicated securitized products more just given your mix. Can you give us a sense for emerging markets\u2019 results in [FIC] in the quarter versus the two reference quarters?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yeah, our emerging markets franchises performed very well in the quarter. They didn\u2019t necessarily contribute as much to growth year-over-year because they actually had a pretty good performance in Q3 last year. Now, the FX franchise performed well globally driven by September but if you\u2019re just trying to isolate what changed year-over-year securitized products had a slightly larger contribution. </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And if you think about the environment that we were living in in Q3 last year compared to Q3 this year I think it\u2019s pretty easy to figure out why there would have been a little bit more client activity around securitized products \u2013 it was just a little bit better. Even though it wasn\u2019t a great rate environment it was certainly a better US rate environment than what we had last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yeah, makes sense. Final one from me: during the quarter at least some of the, I guess Dodd-Frank driven new daily filings on liquidity and I think some of the Volcker stuff started to go into effect for the GFEBS. And I was just wondering to what extent you might ascribe some of what we were hearing towards the end of the quarter, [which] was some liquidity issues in credit markets \u2013 does that have anything to do with it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">You know, I don\u2019t know if I would ascribe movements in the credit markets, certainly not to Volcker. But I think everyone is looking to see how they\u2019re going to manage in a SLR/LCR/NSFR type of world. And anytime that you put out brand new rules I think it takes a while then for the system to sort of adapt to them. And that may have been some of the noise that you heard about at the end of the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">But do you think it has or maybe had temporarily an impact on the inventory management for the big dealers?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I would say that anybody who\u2019s concerned about managing their balance sheet, yeah, it would definitely have an impact. You have to be highly cognizant now of your SLR ratio and you\u2019ve got to manage through both the SLR and the LCR. So depending upon what deposits you take in, those deposits could have a high liquidity value or they could have zero liquidity value. If a deposit has zero liquidity value then you can\u2019t do anything with it other than invest it overnight, which means you\u2019re holding either cash or overnight Treasury securities. Now that drives up the asset side of your balance sheet and now you\u2019ve got to be worried about your SLR constraints because all of a sudden now you\u2019ve got to put capital against that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So depending upon where any individual firm was at quarter-end I would say that they were definitely watching both the asset side of the balance sheet from an SLR point of view and the right side of the balance sheet from a combined LCR and SLR point of view.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Got it. That\u2019s very helpful, thank you. And thanks for taking my questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Not a problem at all, Guy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Matt O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">If I could follow up on your comment about a strong CECCAR submission, if you can elaborate on that \u2013 on what does \u2018strong\u2019 mean do you think from a process point of view, from a capital [deployment ask] or just any comments you can give around that since you did mention it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yeah, I think as I described, Matt, really we\u2019ve been focused on a number of things. But one is that really taking the CECCAR process and really embedding it into the firm and again, I think that goes along a few different channels. One is management engagement \u2013 how is management thinking about the business? What are the risks in their business? How do we quantify those? How do we position the firm against those? </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Second is I think work we\u2019ve done around our models \u2013 building model validation, model integration into the firm. I think that we\u2019ve worked hard in terms of making sure in essence we\u2019ve got the boots on the ground across the different areas, in particular second and third lines of defense and making sure that they\u2019re synched up against our businesses and really operating in the right way. So it\u2019s a big focus towards model build-out, that infrastructure, but most importantly how really that gets embedded in the way we think about and run the business on a day-to-day basis \u2013 not a one-off submission and then back to the old ways.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Matt O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. And I realize it\u2019s still about five, six months away in order to get all the guidelines, but as you think about what a successful outcome would be is passing on a qualitative basis enough or would you want to also be able to have a meaningful amount of buybacks as well to view it as a success?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Well I think as you alerted to we\u2019re not going to speak to what the number is but we\u2019ve got to certainly get beyond success being measured as a successful submission with no capital ask, right? We\u2019re in a position where we\u2019re fortunate to generate large amounts of regulatory capital and we\u2019ve got to put the firm in a position to return that. So I would view a successful ask as a combination of those things.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Matt O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. And then just separately on expenses, the Q4 commentary of relatively flat on a core basis is helpful. As we think into next year maybe before we account for some of the business exits, but how should we think about the expense run rate beyond this year? You\u2019ve been taking some of these repositioning costs that I know have been driving the positive operating leverage. Is there more benefit from those still to come?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Matt, at this point in time we\u2019re still focused on in 2015 on delivering being able to run Citicorp in the mid-50%s efficiency ratio. So that\u2019s the target that we set out for ourselves a year and a half ago and that\u2019s still the target that we\u2019re working at towards 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Matt O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. Alright, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Hi. As far as the GCB restructuring, Mike, is this it \u2013 going from 35 markets to 24? Or is there potentially more?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Well I think as you look, Mike, just to kind of put it in context \u2013 I think we\u2019ve gone from a number higher than that. I think in aggregate we\u2019re down somewhere around 15, 17 markets in the past couple years. And so what we\u2019ve said is that we\u2019ve got an ongoing process which we\u2019ve talked very openly about, about our country bucketing and our business bucketing and the way we think about those. </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">We do still have businesses in the optimized bucket \u2013 those businesses obviously not being on the list are making progress towards the goals that we\u2019ve agreed to in terms of where they\u2019re going to get those businesses. And again, those buckets will continue as they\u2019ve been to be fluid and we\u2019ll keep assessing things against what we\u2019ve laid out. But right now those businesses are on track and feel like they\u2019ve got a pathway to get to a place of having adequate returns or good returns in the consumer business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Is there more restructuring in the US that you can do? You mentioned mortgage and branches \u2013 what else could be done?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Well, as we\u2019ve laid out a series of metrics from a headcount, a product perspective, from a site perspective \u2013 things that are probably the largest drivers of costs in there, it\u2019s on Page 13 in the deck. And so we\u2019re committed on delivering those. We\u2019ve made significant progress against those: continuing to simplify our products, continuing to rationalize our branch footprint, continuing to shrink and consolidate our support sites. And again, those are the big drivers of expenses. So as we\u2019ve laid out there we\u2019ve got more work we think we can do.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So getting to that target range in GCB of 49% to 52%, that would be more than simply less legal and repositioning costs? John, I think your answer earlier said that that was going to be a nice driver of it, but other than that what would be the main drivers?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"> No Mike, as I said before there\u2019s two elements to it. I drew your attention, at least I intended to draw the attention to that Chart 12 and note that there were two areas of the expenses. We had the light blue box at the top which talked about the legal and repositioning charges and I pointed to that as one area that we felt would contribute next year. But more importantly, and I think this is where you\u2019re driving, it\u2019s the big blue box at the bottom that really talks about those core operating expenses. And there we intend to continue to drive those core operating expenses down.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">We lay out for you on Slide 12 the progress that we\u2019ve made on a trailing twelve-month basis but then you can also see when you flip over to Slide 13 that we\u2019re making progress in that area on a quarter-by-quarter basis. And that is going to continue as we continue to execute on the actions that Mike talked about \u2013 as we continue to reduce headcount, we continue to simplify the product offering and we continue to rationalize our branch and support site structures. So all of that work continues; it\u2019s ongoing now. It will remain ongoing into next year and beyond.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay, and last follow-up on that: when you say \u2018support sites\u2019 I\u2019m just trying to get a little more meat on the bones on this Slide 13. Is support sites going down, is that a big expense takeout; or the headcount reduction, the branches, that should all help. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of magnitude.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So support sites, Mike, I\u2019d break into probably two big buckets. One would be service centers and the second would be datacenters, and obviously as you can consolidate those, turn space back, create more scale, etc., you\u2019ve got the ability to get those costs out \u2013 centers of excellence, however you choose to describe them. And so I think we\u2019ve shown the ability to do that and we\u2019ve got more work to do.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yeah, Mike, I think when you look at those four items that we lay out there they all are somewhat interrelated. We don\u2019t have \u201cstandardize the platform\u201d there but clearly as you simplify your products and you put everything onto one standard platform that means that you can then collapse a lot of individual call centers into one because you\u2019re not running individual call centers for different products in every country \u2013 each one then having to deal with a different operating system.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So we standardize the information available to our customer service personnel. We make it easier for them to understand the products that we offer. That then enables them to provide a much better experience to our clients. So we can simplify the products, we standardized the platforms; we can reduce the sites and therefore we can actually provide our clients with a better experience with less people.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Alright, that\u2019s helpful. Just one other separate question: I opened up the paper this morning and saw some comments from Mike O\u2019Neil, the Chairman. And so Mike Corbat, what\u2019s your current relationship with Mike O\u2019Neil, and just I thought the timing was interesting to see the Chairman. And Citigroup\u2019s the last major US bank that has the CEO and Chairman position split so I\u2019m just wondering your current thoughts on that \u2013 the tradeoff, the benefits, the costs of having that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Sure. I think from our perspective, I won\u2019t speak to others\u2019 \u2013 I think our relationship and our structure works well for us. I think our relationship is excellent. I think the dialog with the Board is very good and I think from a governance perspective and a relationship perspective when we think about and run the firm and the delineation of duties, it certainly works for us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And the degree that Mike O\u2019Neil\u2019s giving you council when it comes to these restructuring moves, like the one you announced today?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I think we always have good, engaged strategic interaction with the Board \u2013 not just Mike but with the Board. And so the Board was aware of these actions and supportive of the actions that management recommended.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Great, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Hi, good morning \u2013 just a quick, ticky-tacky question at this stage. You mentioned the core operating expenses at $10.9 billion looking to keep relatively flat into Q4. I know we have some CECCAR expenses coming up a little bit. I mean maybe that adds a percent or something like that but we should expect those CECCAR expenses are on top of what you did in Q3, would it be incremental? Or are you saying that you think you have other things in core operating expenses you\u2019re going to peel back and that\u2019s going to offset your CECCAR expense increase in the quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">We would say that again, we should be able to keep the expenses relatively flat into Q4. We still have benefits that are rolling off for other expense initiatives that we\u2019ve introduced. I mean you\u2019ve seen the amount of repositioning charges that we\u2019ve taken \u2013 those repositioning charges do generate real savings. But those savings in Q4 are likely going to be reinvested then as we continue to enhance our capital planning process, CECCAR.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Right, I get it. Thanks a lot.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Not a problem.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC Capital Markets </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Thank you, good afternoon. Can you share with us, in your last (q) I think you put in there that a 100-basis point shift in the yield curve would contribute an additional $1.9 billion or so to revenue. If the yield curve flattens and The Fed does move rates up next year, but as you notice the ten-year today is down to about 2.2% - if we don\u2019t get the parallel shift how much of the benefit would you likely see with the front end going up but the long end remaining anchored where it is today?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">If the front end went up but the long end dropped, there is a scenario we\u2019ve laid out for you which has a 100 basis point increase in short-term and a relatively flat long-term. I think what you see in that type of environment, we capture the lion\u2019s share of the $1.9 billion. I don\u2019t have that number in my head but it\u2019s a substantial portion of the $1.9 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC Capital Markets </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Great. The second question is can you remind us, in terms of your capital ratios, your Tier One Common ratio for example, what kind of cushion do you want to keep above whatever the final number turns out to be? And I know that\u2019s a moving target because you\u2019re seeing The Fed and others ask for more capital and they haven\u2019t given us the exact numbers yet, but are you looking to maintain a 50- or 100-basispoint number over whatever the final target becomes?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Well, as you say it\u2019s a little hard right now because we don\u2019t know where the final rules are going to come out. So give us a chance to take a look at the final rule and then we\u2019ll be happy to tell you what kind of buffer we think we need. There\u2019s still a bit of rulemaking yet to be laid down. We\u2019ve got the promise of another G-SIFI surcharge. We\u2019ve got OLA that still needs to be finalized. So when these things begin to settle down we\u2019ll be happy to come back to you then with a more informed target.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC Capital Markets </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay, thank you. And then as of today what would you point to as your binding constraint on the capital ratios? Which one do you guys look to today? And again, I know that this may not be the case a year from now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Well let\u2019s see \u2013 on October 14<sup>th</sup> I\u2019d say it\u2019s Tier One, Basil-3, Advanced Approach, Tier One Common. But check back with me by November 14<sup>th</sup> and I may have a slightly different answer. And I\u2019m not trying to be cute \u2013 it\u2019s just that as the rules begin to change and they intersect you\u2019re constantly battling one against the other. If you had asked me a year ago I would have said SLR was going to be the binding constraint. Six months ago I was really worried that Standardized RWA, the standardized approach was going to be the binding constraint. Today I feel like it\u2019s Basil-3 Tier One Common, and then of course there\u2019s always the ultimate is of course the CECCAR submission itself. So we need to keep our eye on all four of those and it doesn\u2019t do you any good to just manage one.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC Capital Markets </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Great. And then one last question: the Shared National Credit Exam hasn\u2019t been released yet, probably will be shortly here, but there was some commentary by The Federal Reserve. They\u2019re still concerned about leveraged loans by some of the larger banks \u2013 they\u2019re aggressively underwriting them \u2013 and they now claim they may use this in CECCAR as part of the qualitative area. Do you guys have any color on that or what do you guys think about that? Are you concerned about that if they bring it into the CECCAR process the way everybody underwrites leveraged lending?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">You know, those rumors are there, Gerard. We haven\u2019t heard anything on that formally so obviously this has been a big area of focus for The Fed and the OCC, so evolving. But we haven\u2019t gotten any guidance on that so far.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC Capital Markets </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Thank you, guys.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Steven Chubak \u2013 Nomura Securities </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Hi, good afternoon. I was hoping you could provide some clarity on what drove the sequential increase in risk-weighted assets. I guess historically what we\u2019ve seen particularly given periods of elevated FX volatility that there\u2019s a natural capital hedge from FX translation on the RWA denominator. And I didn\u2019t know if you could provide some more detailed guidance as to what were the sources of RWA build in the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yeah, that\u2019s a good question, Steven. Since the beginning of the year we\u2019ve absorbed about, well, you can see it on the chart back on Slide 20 \u2013 we\u2019ve got about $60 billion in incremental RWA since the beginning of the year. The impact of business growth in Citicorp has been more than offset by reductions in Holdings and we\u2019ve gotten a little bit of FX benefit in this quarter that was probably worth about $10 billion or so. But the entire net impact really is the result of enhancements to our risk models, primarily credit models, and as well as our interpretation of the final B-3 rules. So we\u2019ve been enhancing our models and that\u2019s caused us then to increase the amount of risk-weighted assets that are required.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Steven Chubak \u2013 Nomura Securities </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Thanks, that\u2019s really helpful. Is that model enhancement process, is it largely completed at this juncture or should we expect that there\u2019s more to come which could result in some RWA stickiness going forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yeah, I\u2019d say we think that now we\u2019ve done an intensive review of the models certainly, especially in the period since we\u2019ve gone live on the Basil-3 advanced approach. And we\u2019re certainly comfortable with the models as they exist right now but here comes the big \u201chowever.\u201d However, our regulators still continue their reviews so there still may be additional enhancements required going forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Steven Chubak \u2013 Nomura Securities </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Alright, fair enough. And just one more from me relating to the Securities portfolio and specifically the breakdown of HTM versus AFS. The last two quarters we\u2019ve seen an increase in the amount of securities you\u2019ve classified as hold to maturity, and just looking at last year\u2019s CECCAR results and in addition to that your midyear stress test exam which was published for public consumption, the AOCI losses were actually quite substantial and presumably should only increase as the number of Basil-3 deductions are recognized within the transitional horizon. I was wondering whether CECCAR considerations have actually prompted you to accelerate the reclassification of some of your securities portfolio and is that something that we should expect to persist going forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I\u2019d say if you looked at the percentage of our investment portfolio that is classified as HTM we\u2019re probably underweight compared to many of our peers. And so as we look at the possibility of reclassifying things between AFS and HTM it\u2019s a little bit more being driven by our view as far as volatility in our OCI, and therefore how that impacts the numerator in our regulatory capital. So again, that\u2019s really our focus. We want to make sure we\u2019ve got the right mix and again, we don\u2019t want to overweight towards hold to maturity. But we would look at it right now and say perhaps we\u2019re a little underweight where we are.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Having said that we\u2019re very comfortable with the level that we have right now so I\u2019m not leading you to the fact that we\u2019re going to be increasing it dramatically. But we may continue to add bits and pieces into the HTM.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Steven Chubak \u2013 Nomura Securities </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Alright, understood. Thanks for clarifying that, John, and thank you for taking my questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Not a problem, Steven.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Erika Najarian \u2013 Bank of America </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Yes, my questions have been asked and answered, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay, thank you Erika.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Ken Usdin \u2013 Jefferies &amp; Company </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Thanks, guys. Just one question for me: John, you alluded in your prepared remarks to the recent bit of slowing in some of the international businesses. And I just wondered if you could flesh out for us when you think about your international businesses and developed versus emerging markets, do you see that slowdown as either A) partly seasonal, B) any change in terms of how you\u2019re perceiving growth; or C) related to just this kind of downgrade of growth expectations \u2013 and how are you responding to that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I would say it\u2019s more of the latter as far as just the overall impact of everyone\u2019s expectations for global growth coming down a bit. In the comments that I made earlier I think what you\u2019re referring to is some of the comments I made as far as loan growth that we had in Latin America, specifically Mexico. So you do have certain market-by-market where you can see the impact, but from an emerging market view we still see good growth, good overall growth coming out of the emerging markets especially when compared to the developed markets. It\u2019s just a little bit less growth than what we would have anticipated earlier in the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Ken Usdin \u2013 Jefferies &amp; Company </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And just as a quick follow-up on that: have you noticed anything then, you\u2019d mentioned a couple of comments in your prepared comments in the deck about spreads but has the spread and competitive environment changed at all in that too? Or are you finding yourself still able to gain share within those faster-growing economies?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Yeah, we\u2019re doing fine and I think that we\u2019re managing to keep pace within the economies in which we operate. We have seen spread pressure hit us in the trade product \u2013 that\u2019s certainly something that hit us this quarter. When you take a look at the revenue growth in TTS, the revenue growth in TTS was impacted both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter by a roughly $40 million decline in Trade product revenues. And while the spreads in the cash management business were largely stable overall trade spreads have been declining now for several quarters. </p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">So we\u2019ve seen that impact but we are maintaining our market share in that product, but we\u2019re doing that by shifting to an originate for sale type of approach. So we\u2019re maintaining market share but instead of originating for balance sheet we\u2019re originating to sell \u2013 that means that we forego net interest revenue in return for an upfront fee but as a result the trade revenue assets have declined, so have our trade assets. But we\u2019ve preserved and in some cases have improved our returns. So there\u2019s different ways of managing through lower spread environments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Ken Usdin \u2013 Jefferies &amp; Company </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Very well, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead with your question. </p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Matt Burnell \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Hi John, thanks for taking my question. Just first of all, and I don\u2019t want to make too much of the midyear DFAST numbers but I was curious \u2013 your PPNR estimate for the most recent midyear DFAST was down about a little less than 30%. In fact that was in line with most of the other big banks but I guess I\u2019m just curious if there\u2019s any color you can provide as to what the difference was between the numbers that you put together for this year\u2019s midyear cycle and last year\u2019s midyear cycle just in terms of the PPNR exchange? </p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Well, I think there\u2019s two things. One is there\u2019s a different scenario. Obviously each year you construct a different scenario in which you then assess your stress within that scenario. So there\u2019s a scenario difference and also as Mike said earlier we\u2019re in the process of enhancing our overall capital planning process and I think you see some of the results in those numbers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Matt Burnell \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Okay. And just moving on to the mortgage business, I know that\u2019s not a huge contributor to your overall bottom line but I guess in the bigger picture I\u2019m just curious how you all are thinking about the potential for loosening of standards by the FHFA even if it\u2019s minimal loosening in terms of opening up maybe the lower end of the mortgage market; and how much that might affect your ability to generate mortgage revenue given that you tend to target slightly better credit quality customers?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">I guess I would start in that, Matt, in terms of saying I think that that\u2019s important. I think it\u2019s good for the market because what we\u2019ve seen is the mortgage market today isn\u2019t functioning the way we\u2019d like. If you\u2019re not 20% down and high FICO it\u2019s been quite tough for people to get in and to be able to afford and buy homes. So one is I think for the overall system we would be supportive of that. </p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">I think as you rightly point out our model is largely focused around our Citi clients which tend to be higher in FICOs and probably have the ability to make higher down payments and higher deposits. But again, some of it falls in there and we\u2019d certainly be open and we\u2019d be supportive of that. So I think from our perspective I don\u2019t think it would have a big impact on Citi but I think it would be very constructive for the market.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Matt Burnell \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Okay, that\u2019s it for me, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Chris Kotowski \u2013 Oppenheimer &amp; Co.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Yeah, hi. I was wondering in the context of the Page 8 disclosure about the impact of the strategic actions is $7 billion in loans roughly; and on Page 31 we see that Korea alone has about $24 billion in consumer loans. So I\u2019m wondering what specifically is in there and what isn\u2019t, and particularly I guess I was wondering is from all those countries is Citi Cards also withdrawing or is it just the basic branch system?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Yeah, let me try to help you through that one. First is we are not exiting the consumer franchise in Korea. We\u2019re exiting a specific element of that business \u2013 the consumer finance business in Korea which is a much smaller component of the overall Korea franchise. So when you take a look at the $24 billion worth of consumer loans that we have in Korea it\u2019s a relatively small amount of those loans that is actually then coming out.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Chris Kotowski \u2013 Oppenheimer &amp; Co.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Okay. And then just the cards \u2013 in those eleven countries are you basically out of the branch system, the branch banking system or also out of the card business as well?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">It\u2019s going to be out of cards as well as out of the branches.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Chris Kotowski \u2013 Oppenheimer &amp; Co.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Okay. And then lastly for me I\u2019m not sure if you can comment but on the cover of the One Main S(1) it lists the proposed maximum offering of being $50 million in size. That seemed very small and I was wondering if there\u2019s any color you can provide us on how we should expect the disposition to proceed in the year ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Sure. I would describe that as a filing and again, I think our stated intent all along in this is to go towards a process that drives this business in terms of best price, best terms to the right buyer. I would say that kind of going in this we\u2019ll run a sale process and if we don\u2019t get a sales process to the right place then we\u2019ll pursue an IPO. But we wanted to have the flexibility to do that and if we got there we didn\u2019t want to have to wait the time necessarily to have to do all the filing. And obviously in preparation for the sale process you do a lot of those things that are requisite in the filing anyway. So it was I think convenient to be able to do that. So again, move towards the sale process and we\u2019ll always have the option to do an IPO if we want to use it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Chris Kotowski \u2013 Oppenheimer &amp; Co.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Great, thank you. That\u2019s it for me.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Mike Corbat </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Great, thanks Chris.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Your next question comes from the line of [Brian Klein-Hansel] with KBW. Please go ahead with your question. </p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>[Brian Klein-Hansel] \u2013 KBW </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Yeah, good afternoon. I just had a quick question on the strategic actions today. You mentioned that these were coming mostly from the optimized restructure market that you had identified previously, but also on that same chart you\u2019d also identified 20 markets which were the invest to grow markets. And I\u2019m assuming that you take these dollars allocated to the eleven markets and move those to the invest to grow. Kind of what are the top three markets that you\u2019re looking to invest in these days?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">I would say as we look around we\u2019re clearly in no particular order investing in the US in several different ways; we continue to invest, we had a stated investment program that we\u2019re gearing towards Mexico. We\u2019ve talked about other markets in Asia where we\u2019ve been targeted and continuing to grow our businesses. So I think there\u2019s several places. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a shortage of places where we can put these resources so to speak at better levels than they\u2019re being used today.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>[Brian Klein-Hansel] \u2013 KBW </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Okay, great. And just one other question on the tax rate guidance that you gave: are you assuming that all the legal charges going forward are now going to be tax deductible and that\u2019s why you\u2019re getting to the lower tax rate there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">No, no. We anticipate that again it\u2019s going to be dependent upon item by item as far as whether or not we would assess an accrual to be tax deductible or not. But as we look into Q4 right now we think that a 32% more or less tax rate is where we\u2019ll end up.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>[Brian Klein-Hansel] \u2013 KBW </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Okay, not a problem.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Thank you. We have no further questions in queue at this time. I\u2019d like to turn the call back to management for any further remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Susan Kendall</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Alright, thank you all for joining us this morning.

Today's call will be hosted by Susan Kendall, Head of Citi Investor Relations. We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Ms. Kendall, you may begin.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Susan Kendall</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you, Brent. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Mike Corbat, will speak first. Then John Gerspach, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation, which is available for download on our Web site, Citigroup.com. Afterwards, we will be happy to take questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectation and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results and capital and other financial conditions may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today, and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the risk factor section of our 2013 Form 10-K.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you, Susan. Good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported earnings of $350 million for the fourth quarter of 2014, or $0.06 a share. These results include the impact of $3.5 billion in legal reserves and repositioning costs, which we had disclosed in December. While these charges had the biggest impact on our results, we also saw a challenging end to the year, with macro uncertainties and falling oil prices resulting in a more difficult market environment than we had expected, particularly in the last few weeks of December.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">At the same time, our institutional banking franchise continued to show solid revenue growth. In consumer banking, our U.S. franchise performed well and we showed modest growth in international consumer, even as the global economic growth remained uneven. In Citi Holdings, we were profitable again this quarter and reduced assets to below $100 billion for the first time, driven by ongoing runoff in asset sales.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">While the overall results for 2014 fell short of our expectations, we did make significant progress towards our priorities, and while some of the steps we took were painful, I believe they allowed us to put our franchise in a position to have a successful 2015. We're doing everything we can to maximize the benefits of our repositioning costs and throughout 2014 we worked hard to improve our efficiency and reduce our cost base. We reduced our head count by almost 10,000 people, closed 95 operation sites, shrunk our branch network by over 10% while increasing digital uptake by consumers, simplified our product offerings, and increased customer satisfaction as measured by net promoter scores.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We sold our consumer businesses in Spain and Greece and took important steps towards the exit of One Main. And in October, we announced plans to exit 11 consumer markets and have already signed two agreements regarding the sales of our Japanese retail business and our consumer business in Peru. These steps are part of our process to build one global consumer bank from a confederation of local banks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Our institutional banking business performed well throughout the year, as we focused on serving our core clients. In investment banking, we gained share with our target clients across most regions, generating strong revenue growth, and despite the low interest rate environment, treasury and trade solutions grew revenues as well, as did our private bank.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">While our markets businesses were impacted by volatility towards the end of the year, we'll continue to take steps to make sure that they are sized correctly for the environment we see going forward. After reviewing certain institutional businesses, we have decided to exit several non-core transactions businesses in order to further decrease our expense base and improve net income. These businesses will be reported out of Citi Holdings going forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">For the first time since its establishment, Citi Holdings was profitable for the full year and we reduced its assets by 16%. By utilizing $3.1 billion in DTA, we exceeded 2013's utilization by $600 million and have now utilized $5.6 billion in the last two years. Despite significant legal challenges, we were still able to generate $11 billion in regulatory capital in 2014, bringing the total to $31 billion over the last two years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">During the year, we managed our balance sheet carefully. We grew our loan book in Citicorp and improved both our net interest revenue and margin from 2013 levels. We made Citi a safer and stronger institution in several ways. We invested in our risk, audit and compliant functions. We reduced our risk to asset profile by asset sales in business exits and we maintained a highly liquid balance sheet while improving the quality of our deposits. Our capital, leverage and liquidity ratios each increased over the course of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Returning capital to our shareholders remains a critical priority. During the year, we invested in and strengthened our capital planning process by focusing on risk identification and scenario design, improved our models, and we fostered a deeper engagement with our businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Last week, we submitted our capital plan to the Federal Reserve and we believe the submission reflects the progress we have made. We're fully committed to sustaining and building on these gains. As recent events have shown, there's no reason to think that the environment in 2015 will be any less challenging than the one we faced in 2014. While the recovery in the U.S. is gaining momentum, aided by lower energy costs, Europe is a continuing area of concern, with Russia and Greece facing the most immediate pressure. And while most emerging markets continue to grow, their economies remain the most vulnerable to external factors.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">That being said, we feel good about how we're positioned and to meet the challenges. This is an important year for our firm and we're committed to reaching our efficiency and return on asset targets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">John will now go through the deck and then we'll answer your questions. John?</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. To start, I would like to highlight a few items from the fourth quarter of 2013 that affect the comparability to this quarter's results as shown on Slide 3.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">On an adjusted basis, we earned $0.06 per share in the recent quarter compared to $0.82 in the fourth quarter of last year. This decline in EPS mostly reflects higher legal and related costs and repositioning charges versus last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">On Slide 4, we show total Citigroup results. In the fourth quarter, we earned $346 million, or $0.06 per share, including the impact of $3.5 billion of legal and repositioning charges. Revenues declined slightly on a reported basis to $17.8 billion, but were up 2% year-over-year in constant dollars, driven by modest growth in Citicorp. Expenses grew 21% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the higher legal and repositioning charges. Core operating expenses were flat, including a benefit from the impact of FX translation. Cost of credit improved from last year. And our tax rate was significantly higher this quarter at 72%, reflecting the non-tax deductible legal accruals.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On a full-year basis, revenues and core operating expenses were fairly stable versus last year. Legal and repositioning charges were significantly higher than the prior year, as we work to resize our operations and address legal issues. As we said in December, we believe we have put a significant portion of our outstanding legal matters behind us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Cost of credit was a tail wind, driven by lower net credit losses. In constant dollars, Citigroup end-of-period loans decreased slightly year-over-year to $645 billion, as 3% growth in Citicorp was more than offset by the continued wind down of Citi Holdings. Deposits declined 4%, as we reclassified $21 billion of Japan retail deposits to held-for-sale in Citicorp, given the sale announcement last month, and deposits continued to decline in Citi Holdings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On Slide 5, we provide more detail on fourth quarter revenues in constant dollars. In consumer banking, revenues were flat sequentially and up 3% year-over-year, driven by North America. Institutional revenues were down from last quarter, reflecting a difficult market environment and seasonally lower activity, but improved slightly from last year. And Citi Holdings revenues were down quarter-over-quarter on lower gains on asset sales, partially offset by lower losses on the redemption of debt. On a constant dollar basis, Citigroup revenues grew over $300 million, or 2% from the prior year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On Slide 6, we show more detail on expenses. Legal and related expenses were over $2.8 billion in the fourth quarter and repositioning costs were roughly $650 million. Excluding these items, core operating expenses of nearly $11 billion increased in constant dollars both year-over-year and sequentially, primarily reflecting increased regulatory and compliance costs, including those related to our enhanced capital planning process, higher volume-related expenses, and certain one-time items partially offset by efficiency savings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">The quarter-over-quarter increase of roughly $200 million was mostly comprised of an adjustment to accruals for certain non-income taxes, such as VAT, higher external legal and consulting fees, higher business volumes in a number of areas, and higher levels of expenses related to ongoing compliance and regulatory efforts, resulting from an acceleration of hiring and related spending originally planned for the first quarter of 2015. All of this increase from the prior quarter reflected expenses that were either non-recurring or already baked into our expected 2015 run rate.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Performance-based incentive compensation was down from the prior quarter. However, this benefit was largely offset by changes to assumptions related to the recognition of deferred compensation. And on a full-year basis, core operating expenses were roughly flat, as repositioning savings, reductions in Citi Holdings, and other productivity initiatives fully offset the impact of higher regulatory and compliance and growth-related costs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On Slide 7, we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. On a reported basis, Citicorp revenues of $16.5 billion declined slightly year-over-year in the fourth quarter, while core operating expenses grew 2% driven by higher regulatory and compliance costs, growth-related expenses, and certain one-time items I just described, partially offset by ongoing efficiency savings and the impact of FX translation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Credit costs improved modestly year-over-year, and the tax rate was significantly higher in the quarter reflecting the non-tax deductible legal accruals. On a full-year basis, the decline in net income mostly reflects higher legal and repositioning costs, partially offset by an improvement in credit. In Citi Holdings, we were profitable again this quarter, with roughly $160 million in net income compared to a loss of over $400 million last year, driven primarily by lower legal and related expenses. Citi Holdings ended the quarter with $98 billion of assets, or 5% of total Citigroup assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Before I go into more detail on Citicorp, I would like to provide an update on our strategic actions in global consumer banking and describe some additional actions we are taking in the institutional clients group. Starting with consumer, last quarter we announced plans to exit our consumer operations in 11 markets, plus our consumer finance business in Korea. Since then, we have executed agreements to sell two of these businesses. Our Japan retail operations and our consumer business in Peru, and we have active processes under way in the remaining markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As we previously indicated, we will report these operations as part of Citi Holdings as of the first quarter. In 2014, these businesses contributed $1.6 billion of revenues and a loss of $36 million, with the loss primarily attributable to repositioning and other actions directly related to the exit plans.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In addition to these actions in consumer, we also plan to exit certain businesses in ICG, including hedge fund services within securities services, and our prepaids cards business in treasury and trade solutions. These represent non-core businesses where we do not believe we have the scale to generate appropriate returns. We are working to exit these businesses in a timely and economically rational manner, with a minimal impact on our clients. In aggregate, the businesses generated nearly $460 million of revenues and a loss of over 80 million in 2014. However, roughly half of the operations pretax loss for the year was driven by repositioning and other actions directly related to the exit plans. We will also report these operations as part of Citi Holdings as of the first quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning back to the fourth quarter, on Slide 10, we show results for international consumer banking in constant dollars. Revenues grew 1% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, reflecting modest volume growth, offset by spread compression and regulatory headwinds in certain markets. Average loans grew 4% from last year. Card purchase sales grew 3%, and average deposits grew 2%. However, revenues were down sequentially, driven by lower investment sales revenues in Asia, reflecting weak investor sentiment and seasonality.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Core operating expenses excluding legal and repositioning costs, grew 2%, as the impact of business growth and higher non-income taxes was partially offset by ongoing efficiency savings. Credit costs were up slightly year-over-year and by 10% sequentially, mostly due to loan loss reserve builds in Latin America, due to portfolio growth and seasoning. We incurred a charge-off of roughly $70 million this quarter related to our home builder exposure in Mexico. However, this charge was entirely offset by a related loan loss reserve release resulting in a neutral impact on overall credit costs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Slide 11 shows the results for North America consumer banking. Total revenues were up 4% year-over-year. Retail banking revenues of $1.4 billion grew 25% from last year, including a gain of roughly $130 million from the sale of certain on-balance sheet mortgage loans. Excluding this gain, revenues grew 13%, reflecting continued loan and deposit growth, as well as abating spread headwinds.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Branded cards revenues of $2.1 billion were flat versus last year, as we grew purchase sales and an improvement in spreads mostly offset the impact of lower average loans, reflecting the continued runoff of promotional rate balances, and retail services revenues declined 3% from last year, primarily reflecting higher contractual partner payments, driven by higher yields and improved credit costs. Underlying drivers for retail services remain positive, as average loans grew modestly and yields improved year-over-year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Core expenses declined year-over-year, but grew modestly from last quarter, driven by seasonal marketing expenses and other episodic items. Repositioning costs were higher this quarter, mostly reflecting actions to rationalize our branch footprint. We continued to resize our North America retail banking business in the fourth quarter, all while continuing to grow deposits, loans, and assets under management.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Over the past year, we have sold or closed over 130 branches in North America and we have announced plans to sell or close an additional 60 branches in early 2015. By the end of the first quarter, roughly 90% of our branches will be concentrated around New York, Boston, Washington DC, Miami, Chicago, LA and San Francisco.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We are focusing on our most productive branches in key urban areas and on growing high quality deposits. While average deposits grew 1% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, checking account balances grew 11%. Today, our average deposit balance per branch is roughly $200 million, up 17% from just a year ago.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Slide 12 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail. Overall, global consumer credit trends remain favorable in the fourth quarter. In North America and Asia, credit remains stable to improving, and in Latin America, as I described earlier, we incurred a roughly $70 million charge-off related to our home builder exposure in Mexico that was entirely offset by a related loan loss reserve release. Excluding this charge-off, dollar losses were flat to the third quarter in constant dollars and the NCL rate would have improved to 4.7%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Slide 13 shows the expense trends for global consumer banking. We reduced our core expenses by roughly $160 million from 2013 to 2014, even while absorbing $100 million of incremental expenses related to the Best Buy portfolio acquisition. This core expense improvement reflects the significant progress we have made with head count reductions, product simplification, and branch and support site rationalization. In 2014, our efficiency ratio was flat to the prior year, even as we incurred higher legal and repositioning costs. Including roughly $900 million of legal and repositioning charges over the past year, our total efficiency ratio for global consumer banking was 56%, and pro forma for the announced market exits, the total efficiency ratio would have been 55%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Turning now to the institutional clients group on Slide 14, revenues of $7.2 billion in the quarter \u2013 in the fourth quarter were flat to last year, and down 17% sequentially. Total banking revenues of $4.1 billion grew slightly from last year and were down 5% from the prior quarter. Treasury and trade solutions revenues of $2 billion were up 1% year-over-year and flat sequentially on a reported basis. In constant dollars, TTS revenues grew 6% from last year and 2% sequentially, as growth in high quality deposits and fees more than offset a decline in trade balances and spreads.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Investment banking revenues of $1.1 billion were down 7% from last year on lower equity underwriting activity, and down 15% sequentially, reflecting the comparison to a very strong third quarter. Private bank revenues of $666 million grew 11% from last year driven by higher volumes and growth in investments, and capital markets products.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Corporate lending revenues were $431 million, up 9% from last year, reflecting growth in average loans and improved funding costs, and down 2% from last quarter, driven by fair value marks on loans. Total markets and security services revenues of $3 billion declined 9% year-over-year, and 30% sequentially.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Fixed income revenues of $2 billion were down 16% from last year, and 33% sequentially, reflecting challenging market conditions, as well as seasonally lower activity versus the third quarter. The fourth quarter started with a volatile environment in early October, and ended in a similar way, with uncertainty around Russia and Greece, as well as falling oil prices in the last weeks of the year, driving increased volatility, wider credit spreads and less liquid trading conditions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Overall, our currencies business navigated well, with stable revenues year-over-year and a moderate sequential decline from a strong third quarter. However, we saw a significant revenue decline in spread products. In particular, credit and municipal products, as we continue to support our clients in a less liquid, more volatile market. Our G10 rates business was also down versus prior periods, mostly driven by the uncertain macro environment in the latter part of December.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Equities revenues of $471 million declined 3% year-over-year and 38% sequentially, both driven by EMEA. Outside of EMEA, our equities revenues increased 24% year-over-year, with broad strength across products, and declined 18% sequentially on seasonally lower activity. In securities services, revenues grew 4% year-over-year on increased client balances and activity, and were down 4% sequentially, reflecting the impact of pending strategic exits.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Total operating expenses of $5 billion grew 3% over last year, and were flat sequentially, as lower compensation expenses and the benefit of FX translation were offset by higher repositioning costs, as well as higher external legal and consulting fees. Credit costs grew to $163 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting an episodic write-off, as well as a reserve build driven by the overall economic environment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On Slide 15, we show expense and efficiency trends for the institutional business. In 2014, our efficiency ratio was flat to the prior year, as lower core operating expenses offset higher legal and repositioning charges. Including roughly $700 million of legal and repositioning charges, our total efficiency ratio was 59%, and pro forma for the announced strategic actions, the total efficiency ratio would have been 58%. Our full year comp ratio was also flat to 2013 at 29%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Slide 16 shows the results for corporate other. Revenues declined year-over-year, driven mainly by lower revenues from sales of available for sale securities, as well as hedging activities, while expenses increased on higher legal and related expenses, as well as higher regulatory and compliance costs, including those related to the CCAR process. Assets of $329 billion included approximately $80 billion of cash and cash equivalents, and $197 billion of liquid investment securities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Slide 17 shows Citi Holdings' assets, which totaled $98 billion at quarter end, with over 60% in North America mortgages. Total assets declined $5 billion during the quarter and $19 billion year-over-year, driven by asset sales and runoff.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On Slide 18, we show Citi Holdings' financial results. Total revenues of $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter were up slightly year-over-year, mainly driven by higher gain on asset sales, and lower cost of funds, and down 20% from last quarter on lower gains on asset sales, partially offset by lower losses on the redemption of debt.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Citi Holdings' expenses continued to decline, driven by the lower level of assets, as well as lower legal and related costs, and credit costs continued to improve as well. On a sequential basis, net credit losses increased, as continued improvement in mortgage losses was offset by the impact of seasoning in the personal loan portfolio, as well as credit losses due to corporate loan sales. However, higher net credit losses were more than offset by higher loan loss reserve release.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Mortgage net credit losses were entirely covered by reserve releases in the fourth quarter. On a full-year basis, 2014 was an important turning point for Citi Holdings. As we achieved profitability while continuing to wind down the portfolio and moving past our legacy legal issues. We sold our remaining Western European retail operations in Spain and Greece, significantly reduced our mortgage exposures, and positioned the One Main business for exit.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On Slide 19, we show Citigroup's net interest revenue and margin trends. Our net interest margin improved to 292 basis points in the fourth quarter, reflecting lower cost of funds and our full-year margin was 290 basis points, up from 285 basis points in 2013. Looking to the first half of 2015, we expect our net interest margin to remain more or less flat to full-year 2014 levels.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On Slide 20, we show our key capital metrics. During the quarter, our CET 1 capital ratio declined to 10.5%, driven by a pension-related reduction in OCI, and an increase in operational risk RWA. Foreign exchange movements had no impact on the CET 1 ratio during the quarter. Our supplementary leverage ratio was flat to the prior quarter, at 6%. And our tangible book value declined sequentially to $56.83 per share, driven by changes in OCI.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">To conclude, I would like to spend some time on our outlook for 2015. We remain committed to delivering on our financial targets, including a mid-50s efficiency ratio in Citicorp and a return on assets of at least 90 basis points for Citigroup. We believe we can reach these targets through a combination of several drivers. First, we continue to believe we can generate low to mid single-digit revenue growth in Citicorp. Citicorp's full-year revenues in 2014 were broadly flat year-over-year. But in many ways, this understates the progress we're seeing across the franchise.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">In North America consumer, we saw 3% growth in the second half of the year, excluding certain one-time items, as we moved past the difficult comparisons in mortgage refi volumes, loans and deposits continued to grow, and spread headwinds began to abate. In international consumer, we also grew revenues by 3% in the second half of the year, even as we saw slower global growth and absorbed significant regulatory and spread headwinds that we see abating somewhat in 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">In investment banking, we saw good momentum again this year, growing wallet share with our target clients and generating strong revenue growth year-over-year. And our momentum in treasury and trade solutions and the private bank was also evident, as we progressed through the year, with continued volume growth translating into stronger revenue performance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">In total, our current expectations for continued volume growth and somewhat abating headwinds provide good line of sight for revenue growth in these businesses, which account for over three quarters of Citicorp revenues. And in markets, we expect our performance in 2015 to reflect the overall environment, with the goal of continuing to gain wallet share with our target clients.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Going into 2014, we knew we would face difficult market comparisons in the first half of the year, which was certainly true. But in the back half, total markets revenues broadly stabilized, even with continued challenging market conditions. Second, we believe we can drive a meaningful reduction in total operating expenses as a result of continued expense discipline to offset higher regulatory and compliance costs, the full realization of cost savings from the actions we took in 2014, and a significant reduction in legal and repositioning costs from the levels we saw in the past year, although on legal, as we have said before, nothing is certain until the matters are resolved. Higher revenues and lower operating expenses would naturally result in positive operating leverage in Citicorp.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">We expect credit costs to increase in 2015 driven by loan growth, as well as lower loan loss reserve releases, and our tax rate should be in the range of 31%. We believe that Citi Holdings will stay at or above breakeven on a full-year basis and we expect to keep balance sheet disciplined, staying at or below our current size. We expect the combination of these factors will help us deliver on both our efficiency and ROA targets in 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And with that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p7\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Hi, good morning. John, I was hoping you could try to give us a sense of how much of the one-time items you had in the fourth quarter core expense figure of the 10.9 core operating expense. You mentioned a number of items that were either pulled forward or that you characterized as one-timish. Can you give us a feel for how much that might have been of the 10.9 billion core expense number?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Well, let's focus on the $200 million. Because we basically \u2013 the guidance that we mentioned as of the end of the third quarter would have been that we would expected the operating expenses in the fourth quarter to be roughly flat. We saw about a $200 million rise, which I gave you some of the component pieces. I would say that somewhere between 50% and 75% of that 200-plus million dollars would be non-recurring, so call it two-thirds is non-recurring.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">That includes the CCAR expense? Some of the CCAR expense?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Some of the CCAR expense in the fourth quarter \u2013 overall in the second half of the year, we incurred CCAR expenses of about $180 million. And roughly two-thirds of that should be non-recurring as well. But that's split, John, between the third and the fourth quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. And any sense \u2013 </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I would say, John, John, back up. Two-thirds of that should be recurring. One third of that is non-recurring of the CCAR expense.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. Those expenses are in the 10.9 that that jumping off point in the fourth quarter expense number, correct?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yes. John, maybe what's simpler is if I took you through where we stand with delivering the repositioning saves that might get you closer to where you're looking to \u2013 to try to get to.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">If you think about our repositioning expenses, over the last nine quarters, we've taken roughly $3.1 billion of repositioning charges in Citicorp, including the actions that we announced back in December of 2012. We expect that the, all of those actions should produce about $3.4 billion of annual savings. Roughly $2.7 billion of those benefits are already included in our fourth quarter expense run rate. Or maybe said another way, the fourth quarter expenses are lower by about $700 million, resulting from the cumulative impact of those actions. So these savings will continue to accrete each quarter and we expect the vast majority of those remaining benefits to be reflected in our expense base by the fourth quarter of 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. So if we actually tried to talk about it in terms of the 10.9 you're running right now exiting the year just under $44 billion in core operating expense. You hope to have that number lower in absolute dollars in 2015 with the savings building?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">John, again, we're committed to delivering that efficiency ratio in the mid-50s for Citicorp.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And as we said before, we think it takes, some low to mid single \u2013 low single-digit revenue increase. We need to deliver on these expense initiatives. We've got the path to get there. I don't want to get into an absolute level of expenses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. And John, in terms of the repositioning, unlike the legal costs, the repositioning, as you and Mike have said, are 100% in your control. So do you expect to have any repositioning in 2015? And should it be a lot lower? Could you give us any kind of sizing perspective on any additional repositioning we should expect in 2015?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I would never use a word like we won't have any repositioning, because we're constantly looking at the business. But it certainly shouldn't be at the level you saw in, in 2014 where we had in Citicorp something like $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion worth of repositioning costs. What we said, John, when we set up those efficiency targets, don't forget, is we said we thought that in a normal year, we would have about 200 basis points of our revenue consumed by legal and repositioning. So we certainly aren't looking to run repositioning anywhere near the level in 2015, anywhere near the level that we ran it at in 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. Okay. Got it. Thanks John.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">No problem, John.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hi, good morning guys. My question is on the strategic actions. There's a lot of moving parts there. And you mentioned, I guess number one that you expect Citi Holdings to remain at breakeven or better next year or 2015. But we have \u2013 you're adding businesses that have been losing money. There's the pretty clear that you guys are looking to sell One Main. Is all of that contemplated in that comment? How do we think about that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">It's all contemplated in that comment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. Perfect. And then have you \u2013 can you guys help us a little? We can all pick our own guess on what maybe what the capital gain could be in One Main or anything else. But with all these actions, is there any kind of a way to think about the RWA reduction potential coming out of One Main, as well as the strategic changes?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">No. One Main has about $9 billion worth of GAAP assets in it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Right.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Obviously, it's higher than that on an RWA basis, but I don't want to get into the capital accretion that might come from a One Main exit. As we get closer to that, again, that's going to be dependent upon which path we go down. We're obviously working a dual path exit strategy for One Main. And so let's think about which path we actually go down and then we'll be able to talk about what the implications are.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. Thanks. And maybe just one last sort of bigger picture question. You guys obviously are a global company that's been I guess a source of some fear in the market. How are you feeling about the international aspect of your business, the economies there, given what we're seeing with the volatility outside the U.S.? Has anything changed? If you look at consumer revenues in international, they are still positive, but she slowed a little bit versus 3Q and maybe that's just seasonality. You're still expecting growth. What do you see as the risk to that expectation of growth outside the U.S. and how are you thinking about it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Well, I think the balance of where growth is going to come from, with the move in oil, has probably, or most certainly shifted over the last couple of months. So I think what you've seen is revisions in terms of many of the developed economies up and some of the emerging economies, and in particular, those that are most dependent on oil export as a big part of their economy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I think when you take the aggregate of those two and add them together, you can look at the growth rates being projected that we're projecting higher growth rates in the global economy in 2015 than we had in 2014. I think when you think of, or as we think of the potential winners and losers and how that impacts our business, I would probably break the world into \u2013 or countries into one of three buckets. Those where there's a clear benefit from the reduction in terms of oil prices, those where there's a clear detriment or headwind that comes as a function of lower oil or energy prices, and then there's a bucket in the middle where it probably becomes a bit more complex. And that is where you've got different combinations of where economies overall benefit, yet you have governments that are quite dependent on oil export for revenue generation against their budgets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And so clearly, when you look across the world today, the big beneficiaries are the U.S. They are Europe. They are China, Japan, India, and you could take that list forward. You look at those that are probably most negatively affected, countries such as probably Saudi Arabia, Russia, Venezuela and Nigeria. The countries that I mentioned in terms of being positive probably account for an excess of 65% of our revenues. And you could measure that in 2013 or 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">If you look at the companies or the countries that are most negatively affected, those countries probably constitute somewhere 2% or less than 2% of our revenues. But that being said, I think we all have to recognize that it's going to create unevenness. It's going to create some uncertainty. It's certainly going to create volatility. And I think we all need to be mindful of that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Great. Okay. That's helpful. Thanks a lot.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Hi, guys.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Hi, Matt.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">If I could follow up on the low to mid single-digit revenue growth, just trying to better understand how you get there. I guess if the NIM's relatively stable and the balance sheet is flat to down, and obviously net interest income is about 60% of revenues how do you call it 2% to 4% of revenue growth, when half of the revenues, or more than half the revenues aren't really growing?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Well, you've got that revenue momentum already in the second half of the year, Matt. So when you're looking \u2013 when you're looking at it, you need to focus on the second half of the year and the momentum that we've gotten. So every one of those businesses, has both interest earning revenues and also fee earning revenues. And we are seeing growth in those businesses in both the NIM, both the near, the net interest revenue, as well as the fee components. Some of it, when you take a look at the full year numbers, it's going to be masked a bit.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Don't forget when you take a look at non-interest revenues, a lot of that impact year-over-year \u2013 come from the mortgage refi boom. When you take a look at mortgage refi, that's fees, those gains that we would have gotten are in 2013 in the first half of the year. They didn't replicate this year. So year-over-year, our fee-related revenue from that is down, I don't know, 700 or so million dollars. So there's a lot of those types of items that are just buried in the results. But we're focused, we certainly are looking through the full year comparisons and looking to what we see in the businesses today as we're operating them.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. And then just separately, can you remind us how the foreign exchange movements impact, I guess you said it doesn't impact regulatory capital. It does impact tangible book. Just remind us if that's the right way to think about it? And then why is there a mark? Why is that something that you can't hedge, because it seems like what happened last year, the dollar strengthening is something that might continue?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Well, Matt, we do hedge. So let's start with P&amp;L. P&amp;L and we have had these discussions over the years. And there's a slide in the back of the earnings presentation. I think its Slide 26, that actually talks to \u2013 which is it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Susan Kendall</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">28.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">28. Sorry. 28. I was off by two. That actually shows you the impact of FX on the various line items. So the dollar strengthening or weakening or different currencies strengthening and weakening has an impact on our revenue line, our expense line and our cost of credit line. However, as you can see in no individual quarter does it have what I would consider to be an outsized impact on our pretax earnings. And in fact, this quarter even with all the volatility, the net impact was close to zero. So that's, that's P&amp;L.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">When it comes to capital, we do hedge our capital that's invested in foreign currencies, but we hedge it with a view towards protecting our CET 1 ratio. And that's why, when you look at how foreign exchange movements occur they not only impact your capital invested, they will impact your assets. And they will also impact some of the assets that you have, such as the intangibles that serve, then, as direct deductions against your regulatory capital base.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So we factor all of that into a hedging program that, gives us fairly good results. And this quarter, with all the movement we had, the combination of our hedging program and then the natural hedges that we have resulted in a zero impact on our CET 1 ratio. However, because we do not hedge every dollar of capital, you will then have an impact through OCI on tangible book. But, if I'm going to run the company with an eye towards where do I have exposure, I want to protect my CET 1 ratio. I don't want to run an FX position through that ratio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And so in a quarter where the dollar strengthens, we may take a reduction on tangible book. But I've protected the ratio. If I go the other way, if the dollar weakens, and we have had quarters where the dollar is weakened, then I may really enjoy the impact that it has on my tangible book, but it's going to destroy my CET 1 ratio. And as you know, that is one of the key measures of regulatory strength that we have. So we think that it's really important that through our hedging program, we focus on that CET 1 ratio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. That's very helpful going through all the detail. Appreciate the color. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Not a problem at all, Matt.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thank you. Good morning. My question is very much a CCAR related one. I think to paraphrase, Michael, you have said in the past that you recognize that a qualitative path with a very, very ultra conservative capital return ask would not really be a win in your eyes. And I'm sorry if I've paraphrased you incorrectly, and go ahead and correct it. But I guess the question is, having now been through the process for this year and done the submission, is that still the way that you feel about it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I think, Guy, we are aiming for, looking for, we worked towards what we would want to be an unqualified path, both qualitatively, as well as quantitatively. I think as we've said all along, capital return is something you work towards over time. But again, we think that our capital ask is the appropriate one. And when all the results come out, we'll obviously let you be the judge of it. But we've felt given everything that it's appropriate and it's right.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. And is there any change in the way that you would sort of answer that question versus what you said, say, at a conference last month?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">No.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. I guess the only other question that I have today is in light of the weakening in certain emerging markets and you were very good about giving us a sense for where your revenues come from in terms of markets that are more and less affected by energy prices. But generally, given some of the weakness that we're seeing in more of those markets, what have you done on both the credit side and on the trading risk side, if anything to say increase the level of scrutiny and protection?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I think you saw back beginning with Gipson, I think as different challenges around the globe in the macro economy have presented themselves. I think we've come out and tried to be very transparent with what our exposures look like. I think in this environment, you can imagine, we continue to watch Europe closely. Clearly, Russia, and we can speak to some pretty significant reductions in terms of risk in Russia. John and I had both mentioned Greece earlier. And clearly, with what I described as those economies that come under pressure either from the broad perspective of just big exporters of energy and suffering that impact or those where governments are extremely dependent on the revenues from energy to fund public and social programs, we obviously have a very close eye towards those and we think we're watching from a risk perspective very closely and monitoring that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. That's helpful. Thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thank you, Guy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Hi. Wanted to follow up to that, which is \u2013 </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Hi, Betsy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Oh, hi, can you hear me?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. So one's a follow-up to the question we just had on just the outlook for economies where they are a little bit weakish. I know you mentioned earlier in the call, Europe, EM could be weakened, even though they are beneficiaries of oil pricing. And obviously we saw a presence in those markets. So if the top line is coming in weaker than you think in some of those economies, do you have room to manage expenses down a little bit more? I know you outlined you hit the targets at year end 2015 on the expense ratio. But just wondering where you might be able to pull some resources out if the top line disappoints.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Betsy, as we've said, we're committed to hitting those targets. We think we've got some level of flexibility obviously, to the extent that we see certain countries or certain businesses, underperforming what the expectations are. And if our view towards the targets change at any given point in time during the year, we'll have that discussion with you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. And then you mentioned at the beginning of the call about the concept of moving away from a confederation of banking organizations to a true global organization. Is the steps to get there what you outlined last quarter, which is just exit the 12 consumer businesses, or is there more to do?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">No. I think we said as we did that, as we looked at the exit of the 11 consumer businesses, that the remaining 24 we thought were the right mix of businesses in the right places, with the right client demographics. And so we feel that the consumer portfolio is at a point in time today where it is, it is the right portfolio, the right mix.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. Just want to be clear on that. Then lastly, there's some action taken today by the Swiss Central Bank. Just wondered how you're thinking about that action and how it impacts your business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Well, I think there's a couple ways we think about it. One is a move of that magnitude and you hear a range of potential standard deviations moves, but it's big. And clearly, those types of one-off moves affect the markets in a couple different ways. One is there's P&amp;L ramifications from the trade. I think there's also longer term ramifications from just people being surprised. There's talk out in the marketplace of \u2013 some of the high frequency traders suffering a fair amount of pain on that. We'll see how that plays itself out. And we've seen in these pockets of one-off volatility that it actually causes people to potentially pull back from the market and we see volumes abate as a result of those. We'll see, we'll see what this move does, but I think clearly, based on market reaction, it came as quite a big surprise.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Right. I mean, from a competitive perspective, there might be some opportunities for you, or no?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I think there could. We are, as you know, a big player in foreign exchange. Our business in the fourth quarter actually performed quite well. We think we're well positioned. And if some of that pain is out there and people can't find their way around it or through it, I think we've got the ability to step in and potentially take share or potentially do more business as a result of that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Hi. I think if we take your target of a 90-basis point ROA in 2015 that would imply that Citi would beat consensus expectations for 2015. So I think that's the way of saying the market doesn't believe you if. I could just go down a couple issues, especially after page 1 of your press release that 2014 was disappointing. So first, on efficiency, just to be clear, John, you have $700 million more of restructuring benefits to go. Would that be in 2015 or over a couple of years?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">No. A bit low, Mike, not every dollar of that will be in 2015, but the vast, vast, vast majority of it will be in 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And is that why you guys are confident, I mean, these are big moves in global consumer efficiency from 56% down to 49% to 52% in 2015 and ICG from 59% down to 53% to 57% also in 2015. I mean, what \u2013 you're reiterating that guidance today. What gives you confidence in addition to those restructuring benefits?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Well, as we said, it will take \u2013 there's some revenue lift baked into at least our initial expectation. But again, it's low single-digit revenue growth. So we're not, I don't think, overreaching for that. But, 2014 was such a noisy year. And we did \u2013 it was impacted by $11 billion worth of legal and repositioning charges that I think sometimes that masks some of the progress that we actually made. If you look at 2014's results, let's take it on the operating results. And we had pretax earnings of $18.6 billion of pretax earnings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Now again, when you take a look at the Citicorp level of legal and repositioning charges that we had, that \u2013 there's over $6 billion of legal and repositioning charges that impacted Citicorp's results. That's about 900 basis points of Citicorp's revenue. So if we had been able to hold legal and repositioning to what we would consider to be the more normal level, say the 200 basis points of revenue that we would have mentioned previously, if you adjust for those two things, take out the 6, substitute in the 200 basis points, the Citicorp efficiency ratio in 2014 would have been 59% and the overall ROA for Citigroup would have been in the mid-80s.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So it's not that we are that far away from the targets. Again, if you normalize for the level of legal and repositioning charges that we had this year. And therefore, we think that given those levels, the 59% efficiency ratio in Citicorp and say the mid-80s ROA for Citigroup, the combination of the steps that Mike talked about earlier, the low single-digit revenue growth, the continued delivery on the expense reduction actions, the careful attention to the balance sheet, all of those things should get us, and keeping Holdings at or above breakeven should be enough to get us to the \u2013 to both the goals that we laid out.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">That partly begs the question. You said you had $3.1 billion of repositioning charges over the last nine quarters. You had another big hit in the fourth quarter. How much more should we expect of these repositioning charges?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">We don't expect to be talking to you next year about significant levels of repositioning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. As it relates to project Rainbow, which does tie into efficiency and also going from a confederation to a global firm, how far away are you guys in having your systems connect and finishing project Rainbow, which really stretches back long time?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Mike, we are \u2013 as we've talked on these calls in some of the forums before, Rainbow is, due for delivery in completion. Again, it's not a one-and-done. We've been continuing to bring countries on, but it's a 2016, largely a 2016 completion date.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And then lastly, again, the math works. We can all, work this out on paper, but then it comes down to execution. Mike, especially after what you called a disappointing 2014 or results below expectations, is this the right team on the field? And I ask that because there have not been really major management changes despite some of the shortfalls. And we know what those were. But how do you think about the team you have on the field?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I feel very good about the team on the field. As you and I have spoken, we've spoken before on the CCAR. At the end of the day, that's my responsibility and I look at these other things that we're trying to work and put behind us from legal issues, to continuing to shape and exit businesses and use repositioning to drive costs out of the firm. I think we've got the right team that's focused on delivering on our targets and delivering on behalf of our shareholders.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">All right. I guess it's a different story if you were not to pass the fed stress test. Is that fair?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I'll let the Board be the judge of that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. All right. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Hi, thanks. I appreciate --</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Hi, Glenn.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Hello. I appreciate the earlier answer when you spelled out the different markets and revenues associated with the beneficiaries and the losers in the oil tug of war. Just curious, how different would those percentages look if we talked about it as a percentage of exposures versus revenues? Do they match up or are they pretty different?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">It's, it's interesting that I pulled these a while back, but if you look, I talked about the four countries I spoke to, Saudi, Russia, Venezuela, Nigeria, which at the end constitute and again, you can go back and look over a number of years pretty consistently somewhere 2 to \u2013 just under 2% of our revenue. They actually, in each of those years as I went back and looked, as a percentage of our end-of-period loans are actually slightly below those percentages on a year end basis, or end-of-period basis. So again, those countries that I just talked about would probably have end-of-period loan balances of less than 1.5% of our outstandings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Great. Thank you. Just a quickie on CCAR. Did you remediate all the MRAs from last year? I know that was one of the contributing factors from the prior year. So I'm assuming you had a playbook that they said fixed all this stuff. Were you able to address all the MRAs?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">We certainly worked to address all the MRAs. The fed will be the ultimate judge as to whether or not the MRAs were in fact remediated.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Got it. In other words, it's not a black and white answer. So I've asked this of the other banks. I do want to get your color. Your disclosure on energy-related exposures is very broad. I think it includes petroleum, energy, chemicals, metals. Can we talk more specifically on what you would deem oil-related and how it breaks down in terms of investment grade, non-investment grade, collateralized, things like that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yes, Glenn. We're going to provide more in-depth information on this topic at next week's fixed income investor review. We'll lay things out for you pretty clearly, but just to get the conversation started, we've got roughly $60 billion of combined funded and unfunded ICG exposure to energy companies. That's including those classified as energy in that conglomeration that you mentioned, PECM, as well as energy-related clients in other disclosed segments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And that $60 billion amounts to about 11% of corporate ICG exposures, just to give you a frame of reference. And as with the rest of our book, the exposure is predominantly investment grade. Certainly over 80%, and as we keep on saying, it's reflecting the focus that we have on large multinational corporations, including the global integrated energy companies. From a geographic point of view, about three quarters of the exposure is in developed markets and the largest exposures there would be in North America and the U.K. And roughly 35% of the exposure represents funded loans.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So the ICG has just over $20 billion of funded exposure to energy and energy-related companies. It represents funded exposure. I've moved to funded exposure. And that represents roughly 3% of our total funded loans. And again, about 80% of the funded loans are investment grade. So that gives you a fairly good overview, I think, of the portfolio. Again, $60 billion investment grade, predominantly investment grade, 80% investment grade. Three quarters of the book in developed country most of that North America, U.K.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Definitely helpful. I appreciate it. Last one, you commented in FX is pretty good, given the volatility. Rates I think was pretty good in general. And those two businesses are bigger pieces of business for you. And you commented the softness is in credit and munis, as you paraphrase facilitating client flow in times of stress. I know this is a hard one and I know you're not alone here. I thought with your business mix you might have had better or less performance down in FIC given your mix. Is facilitation \u2013 were there large losses associated with that in this type of environment? Or is it a volume thing? How much can we attribute to inventories? I was just scratching my head a little bit on how that contributes to weakness.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">The biggest impact that we had year-over-year, Glenn, really is in the spread products business. So and that really is a result of taking marks on inventory positions that we've got to support the customers. And again, I don't think, as you just said, I don't think that we're alone there. We do have probably a slightly different mix than, than many of our other competitors, but even within there, we've got a fairly large muni book, probably a little bit larger than with some of the other banks would have. And so that certainly adds then to the results that we're getting out of the spread products.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. I appreciate all the answers. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Not a problem.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Good afternoon.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Hi, Brennan.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Following up on the question there from Glenn on exposures with oil, when we look at the last few years in DCM volumes in the energy business, looks like you guys have a bit more bigger market share there. Is there any reason why that wouldn't be a bit of a headwind for your DCM business here if we assume that there's a slowdown in energy-related issuance?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Some of these things will certainly have impact. I would say that global energy has certainly been a robust area for the last four years and clearly, our investment banking franchise, as with other institutions, has seen significant growth in episodic business as a result from that sector. And you're going to have some impact for lower, lower commodity prices and lower equity valuations. That is certainly going to have an impact on equity offerings and IPOs. But energy, energy is a broad business, and some sectors are going to be impacted more than others. And so we continue to see bust activity in some sectors where we're a leader, and I think you'll see the upstream in the energy services sector certainly see significantly less activity. So we'll just see how the whole mix continues.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. All right, thanks. And then shifting gears to Mexico, there was some noise and speculation, color in the market on Banamex and the fact that there would be a bunch of bidders for it and such. Is that \u2013 is the reason for that noise because you all were having dialogue? Or is this just from companies hoping to bid for an asset if it happens to come on the market?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">We rarely comment on things. And in that case, we felt compelled to go out and comment and say that we are not a seller of Banamex. And I don't think we can be any more clear about that on these calls and in the forums. I've spoken directly to it and the importance of the franchise and why we're so constructive on our position in Mexico and why we think Banamex is the right way to express that in Mexico. So we have a terrific franchise. We're committed to it. And we think there's very good things ahead coming out of that business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">That's clear. Thanks. And then in equities, right, I know you guys called out the weak cash revenues in EMEA. But was there anything else behind the equities' weakness? Also, more broadly, is there maybe an updated plan for the equities business because it does seem like there's a pretty regular stumble in that business, whether it's derivatives or in this case EMEA or what have you. How do you feel about it currently and where do you want to take it in the next couple years? </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">We're committed to the equities business. And this has been a business that we have spent a lot of time working on. And I think the \u2013 outside of EMEA, this quarter we've actually got performance that shows the progress that we've made. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, excluding the performance in EMEA, the rest, we had 24% revenue growth year-over-year, in every other region, North America, Latin America, Asia all saw double-digit growth. It's not that there's just one region that's driving the action here. This is a good franchise. We have an issue with our equities franchise in one region. And we have certainly begun to take actions there. We've made management changes, beginning in the late second half of 2014 and we do expect that region to be a much better performer in 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And given the fact that it was so strong in other regions, were there some sort of risk management or facilitation losses there, or was it purely just volume-driven?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">No, it's a combination. We had volumes, and we had strong performance in some of our equity derivatives business. Asia had a very good performance in equity derivatives this year for one in the quarter. So did Latin America. So it was pretty broad-based good performance. Again, the one difference would be \u2013 the one exception to that would be in EMEA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay. And then last one for me, you gave some helpful color on the fact that ICG expenses, you took down the incentive comp. But there was an offsetting assumption to the deferral, deferred comp piece. Could you maybe give us a little bit more color on those changes? Was that tied to repositioning that you guys are planning? Or is it a change in the timing of the deferral schedule? Are you shifting to more cash oriented comp? What's driving that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">No. It's a combination of factors, as so many other things are. And as you go through the year, you make assumptions both on the absolute, the dollar level of deferred comp that you're going to have. And don't forget, every country has got some slightly different rules. We also need to make assumptions based upon the level of forfeiture that we'll have coming out of deferred comp as people leave. And, we've got \u2013 we had slightly less turnover this year, in the non \u2013 outside of the actions, of course, that we instigated.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So we had to change the view that we had towards the forfeiture percentages and as well as the absolute amount of deferred comp that we were going to have. And so all of that we cleaned up in the fourth quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Got it. Thanks for the color.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Not a problem.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Duong</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Hi, everyone. This is actually Steven Duong in for Gerard. Just starting out on the credit, where do you guys see your net charge-offs going in 2015? And what would be the drivers of that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I don't want to get into any individual line item forecasts. Obviously, what we said in the prepared remarks is that the cost of credit is likely to increase. That's going to come from a combination of both. We're likely to have slightly higher NCLs. I can't tell you \u2013 just as we continue to grow the book, it's not because we see credit quality weakening anywhere. And we continue to benefit this year from loan loss reserve releases and that is certainly likely to lessen next year. So the combination of those two items will largely cause an increase in our actual reported costs of credit. But we don't see any diminution in the credit quality of the portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Duong</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay, great. Thank you. And just switching over to Volcker Rule on trading. Volcker Rule's been here since July. Are you guys seeing your traders maybe being a little more cautious so that they are not doing any prop trading? And just a follow-up to that, where do you see the Volcker Rule impacting liquidity in the fixed income markets?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I think Steven \u2013 it's Mike. We haven't been a proprietary skewed institution for a long time. And so I would say no, that we really haven't seen those impacts, that ours is predominantly a client-facing organization. I think ways that you're going to see \u2013 I think we've already seen it manifesting itself probably comes in the form of liquidity, that there's just things we're not in or there's types of trades we're not going to do, and in times of market disruption, I think the buy side finds it quite difficult to find liquidity in certain types of assets or in certain asset classes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And I think that's a reality of some of those changes. And so again, we've talked a bit about that we're probably going to see heightened periods of volatility as a result of that. I think you're going to see more price fluctuations around certain types of asset classes as I think bank and broker balance sheets have become more refined and defined in terms of what they do, and I think that just manifests itself in just less liquidity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Duong</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Great, thank you. And just last question, can you remind us in your Citi Holdings, how much of your home equity book goes to full amortization of the principle and interest in 2015 and 2016?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">We will update those disclosures when we publish the Q, but it's roughly $4 billion of HELOCs that become fully amortizing in 2015. And then I think there's $5 billion that go fully amortizing in 2016 and again in 2017.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Duong</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay, great. And just looking back at \u2013 in 2014, even though that's not that large, but, have you guys seen any \u2013 what the early credit metrics have been on home equity book?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">You mean as far as the home equity loans that that have gone to full amortization or just in general?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Duong</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Correct. Yes, just the full amortization portion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Just the full amortization portion. They have been fairly consistent with the results that we've gotten for that over the last couple of years. Slightly higher levels of delinquencies, slightly higher NCL rate. Everything is either on track with or slightly better than the assumptions that we have built into our loan loss reserve model.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Duong</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Great. Well, that's all our questions. Thank you again.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Not a problem, Steven. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead with your questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Thanks. I'll follow up offline. Thanks, John.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay, Eric. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I had a quick question on the revenue growth targets that you gave out there for Citicorp. What's the trading revenue growth assumptions that you have built into those targets? I mean if trading revenues decline year-over-year, can you still hit that revenue growth target?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">What we've said, at least what I think I said in the prepared remarks was that our trading markets will perform in line with the market. And so, we're not, we're not giving any view towards what trading revenues will or won't do in 2015. So we're expecting \u2013 as we said, we had basically flat revenues on those businesses in the second half of this year compared to the second half of last year. We'll see how 2015 goes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay. And then just one thing in the North America cards. You've mentioned for a couple years ago that the runoff of promotional balances has been a headwind. Is there any way you can size what that promotional balance as a percentage of the total or may be say that when you expect to actually what quarter kind of the headwind will be?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">No. We haven't talked to that publicly. And I quite frankly, I don't have those numbers right in front of me right now anyway. It's not going to continue forever, but I just don't have it. Sorry.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Sorry.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">John, I just wanted to clarify something that you had mentioned relating to the efficiency target of 55%. One of the things that -- </p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Hold it, hold it, Steven, Steven, Steven.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Mid-50s.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Mid-50s, okay. I suppose after applying all the adjustments that you had talked about relating to the strategic actions on a pro forma basis, contemplating some of the restructuring benefits, the majority of the $700 million that you alluded to, I still get to about a mid single-digit revenue growth number. And I suppose is the growth \u2013 the low single digits that you're referring to, is that off of the reported revenue base from this past year, is it a pro forma revenue base, which should include some revenue attrition as you exit some of those non-core businesses?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">It would be a low single-digit growth off of where we performed in 2014. You can pro forma \u2013 I'm not going to go into every \u2013 I can't help you with your model, Steven.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I guess the low single digits seems reasonably conservative, but if you have all the pro forma actions that are taken to drive that improvement in the efficiency target, it feels as though the revenue growth actually needs to be a little bit better than that. I just wanted to confirm whether that was the appropriate way to think about it or not.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">No, I don't think so.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay. Then just one more for me on a topic that's garnered some attention in the press relating to the growth in your derivatives book, at least through the first nine months of 2014. I actually wanted to just inquire as to whether you're managing that \u2013 how \u2013 I guess how much more growth you can support or whether one of the important considerations we should have is the potential risk that the growth and derivatives book over the last nine months could potentially move you into a higher adjacent bucket, based on the inputs that have just come out from the fed.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Yes. All very good questions, but first, let's start with the fact that what everyone's been focused on is not the growth in our book, but the growth in notionals. And notionals, as you well know, really are not any sort of measure really of risk or necessarily of counter party engagement, net counter party engagement. It's a reference sum on which then other things are calculated. So we have been working to compress the trades and what you'll see when we publish results at the end of the fourth quarter is a reduction in the reported amount of gross notionals. Those are the notionals that we had at the end of the third quarter I believe were about 65 trillion of notionals. And that's being reduced now to 60.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay. Actually, that's really helpful. Thank you for taking my questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Not a problem at all.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just one follow-up and then I'll jump offline. But John, I just wanted to confirm some of the numbers you were saying before in terms of the cost reductions that are currently in the fourth quarter run rate from the repositioning exercise, were 700 million. That's not 700 million of incremental cost benefit. That's what's currently in the run rate right now, with another 150 to come over the next year-plus. Is that how we should be thinking about it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">More or less, yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay. Thanks very much. I'll jump offline for my other questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Not a problem.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Erika Najarian</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Yes. Just one quick one for me. As the full CCAR process is now behind you, do you feel that the feedback that you've got \u2013 the specific feedback that you got on the steps you have to take in order to remedy what the fed is looking for on the qualitative side, was it more robust and specific this year versus last year's process?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Well, I think first, Erika, I would say that the CCAR process is never behind you, right, that the CCAR process is just part of what we do and how we run the firm. So we in essence put a submission in, but the process continues and obviously us wanting to continue to improve and continue to embed. I would say that we had terrific engagement from the fed at every level, from our onsite team to the horizontal work teams to Washington and so I think that the communication was quite good.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And, again, at the end of the day, our submission is our submission, but we feel like the communication is good and we felt that we knew what it was we needed to do and obviously, we felt like that we've accomplished what it was we set out to do, but more to do as we go into the future and I think as I said in my opening remarks, I feel good about our submission.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Erika Najarian</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Great. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Your next question is a follow-up from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.

Today\u2019s call will be hosted by Peter Kapp, Head of Fixed Income Investor Relations. We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Mr. Kapp, you may begin.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Peter Kapp</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you, Brent. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CFO, John Gerspach, will speak first; then Eric Aboaf, our Treasurer, will take you through the Fixed Income Investor Review materials, which are available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we will be happy to take questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation may contain forward-looking statements which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results and capital and other financial conditions may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings including, without limitation the Risk Factors section of our 2013 Form 10-K.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">With that said, let me turn it over to John.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Hey, thank you, Peter and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to be hosting our Fixed Income Investor Review this quarter. Eric Aboaf, our Treasurer will review our balance sheet, liquidity profile and capital position and we will provide guidance on our current funding plans for 2015. Before I turn it over to Eric, however, I would like to highlight some key points from our fourth quarter and full year results on Slide 2.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Last week, we reported earnings of roughly $350 million for the fourth quarter of 2014, including the impact of $3.5 billion in legal and repositioning costs, which we had previously disclosed. On a full year basis, revenues grew slightly, while core operating expenses and credit costs declined. However, higher legal and repositioning costs drove a decline in net earnings to $11.5 billion. While these legal and repositioning charges had a significant impact on our results for the year, we believe we took important steps to resize our operations and address our legal issues. As we said in December, we believe we put a significant portion of our outstanding legal matters behind us. Although of course nothing is certain until the matters are resolved. At the same time during 2014, we continued to make progress on our key execution priorities. In consumer banking our U.S. franchise performed well and we showed modest growth in international consumer even as global economic growth remained uneven.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Our institutional businesses performed well throughout the year as we focused on serving core clients. We generated solid revenue growth in banking driven by investment banking, treasury and trade solutions and the private bank. Our markets businesses were impacted by volatility towards the end of the year and we will continue to take steps to make sure that they are sized correctly for the environment we see going forward. For the first time since its establishment Citi Holdings was profitable for the full year and we reduced its assets by 16% to below $100 billion. And we utilized $3.1 billion of deferred tax assets. During the year we managed our balance sheet carefully. Grew our loan book in Citicorp and improved both our net interest revenue and margin from 2013 levels. We continued to reduce funding costs by increasing the quality of our deposits and optimizing our debt outstanding. And our capital leverage and liquidity ratios each increased over the course of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">On Slide 3, we show total Citigroup results adjusted for the items noted on the slide. We earned $346 million in the fourth quarter as our results were impacted by significant legal charges and repositioning costs. Revenues declined by 1% year-over-year as shown on the slide, but increased 2% on a constant dollar basis, while credit costs continued to fall. For full year 2014, we earned $11.5 billion. Looking ahead to 2015, we remain committed to delivering on our financial targets including a mid-50s efficiency ratio in Citicorp and a return on assets of at least 90 basis points for Citigroup. We believe these targets can be delivered through a combination of modest revenue growth in our core business, maintaining expense discipline to offset higher regulatory and compliance costs and realizing the cost savings from the actions we took in 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">And with that I will turn it over to Eric.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><strong>Eric Aboaf</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Thank you, John. Let me start on Slide 4 with a review of how we are managing our balance sheet to drive profitability and returns and adapt to both current and expected regulations. On a reported basis, our total assets declined by $40 billion in the quarter mainly as a result of the dollar\u2019s continued appreciation against foreign currencies especially the euro, yen and peso. Therefore to provide more meaningful insights into the trends of our underlying business, we presented this slide in several others in today\u2019s presentation on a constant dollar basis. On this basis we have held our balance sheet roughly flat below $1.9 trillion over the past five quarters, while continuing to optimize both our assets and liabilities and supporting our client activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">On the assets side of our balance sheet cash and investments were 27% of our assets, consistent with recent quarters as we have maintained liquid balance sheet. Net loans were unchanged year-over-year as 3% growth in Citicorp was offset by continued runoff in Citi Holdings\u2019 loans. Trading assets and liabilities increased during the second half of 2014 as increased market volatility particularly in rates and currencies increased the carrying value of our existing derivative positions. We expect these values to decline in the coming months as the shorter tenor positions runoff.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">On the liabilities side, we maintain a diversified stable and low-cost funding profile. Including the Japan retail bank deposits which were reclassified to held for sale during the quarter due to our announced sale agreement, deposits declined 2% as we carefully managed the quality of our deposit base under the LCR including actively reducing zero value deposits. Repo decreased 10% from last year as we strengthen our liquidity position and trading liabilities increased consistent with trading assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">At the bottom of the page average assets grew $35 billion sequentially and were greater than ending assets, mostly due to the elevated trading assets that I just mentioned. We expect average assets to decline going into 2015 though foreign exchange rates may influence the balance. Overall, we continue to actively manage the return profile of our balance sheet allocating from lower return assets to higher return opportunities while serving our clients.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Now, turning to Slide 5, let me discuss our loan portfolio. In constant dollars, total Citigroup loans increased 1% year-over-year as 3% growth in Citicorp was offset by continued reductions in Citi Holdings loans. Consumer loans grew 2% year-over-year driven by 4% growth internationally. Corporate loans grew 4% year-over-year. Traditional corporate lending balances grew 4% with strong growth in North America as we supported transaction activity among our core clients. Trade loans decreased 8% as we maintain trade loan origination volumes, while reducing lower spread assets and increasing asset sales to optimize returns. And private banking and markets loans increased 16% led by growth in the North America private bank contributing to revenue growth in that business. Citi Holdings loans decreased 20% year-over-year mainly due to continued runoff in asset sales in North America mortgages as well as the sale of our consumer banking operations in Greece and Spain.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">As John mentioned in our earnings call last week, on Page 28 of the appendix, we have provided information on our corporate credit portfolio, including additional detail on our $60 billion of energy exposures covering both funded loans and unfunded commitments. Approximately 70% of our exposures are in the U.S., UK and Canada. Funded loans to the energy industry amount to approximately $22 billion or roughly 3% of Citigroup\u2019s total loans. And roughly 80% of our energy exposures are rated investment grade consistent with our target market strategy and our overall corporate credit exposures. We actively manage this risk in several ways. Loan underwriting decisions are calibrated to a through the cycle perspective on commodity prices. Industry limits control our aggregate exposure to the energy industry and we actively monitor performance and manage net exposures in the event of any credit quality changes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On Slide 6, I\u2019d like to review the credit trends in Citicorp\u2019s consumer and corporate loan portfolios. On the top half of the page illustrates net credit losses in Citicorp\u2019s consumer credit portfolio across four regions. In the fourth quarter, global consumer credit trends remained favorable, with net credit losses of 2.33% in North America, the NCL rate continued to improve to 255 basis points. Asia remains stable with net credit losses of 80 basis points. And in Latin America, we have recorded roughly $70 million charge-off related to our homebuilder exposure in Mexico, which was entirely offset by related loan loss reserve release. Excluding this charge-off, the NCL rate in Latin America would have improved to 467 basis points.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Although not shown on this page, credit quality in Citi Holdings also continues to improve with NCLs in the North America mortgage book declining to 130 basis points this quarter. All the losses in that portfolio were offset by reserve releases. The bottom half of the page highlights the high quality of our corporate portfolio. Non-accrual loans as a percentage of corporate loans improved slightly to 41 basis points as a charge-off of an exposure in Latin America in the quarter drove a reduction in the non-accrual loans in that region.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Now, turning to Slide 7, let me discuss changes in our deposit base, which continues to serve as the primary source of funding for the lending activities in our banks, including the Japan retail bank deposits. On a constant dollar basis, total deposits declined 2% year-over-year. Consumer deposits increased 2%. North America consumer deposits increased 1% with a continued focus in growing checking account balances and despite selling or closing over 130 branches in the past year. And international consumer deposits, including the Japan deposits, grew 3%. Corporate deposits increased 1% year-over-year as we saw continued strong deposit growth in North America while we actively reduced lower quality deposits. Citi Holdings and other deposits have declined year-over-year due to the transfer of MSSB deposits.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On Slide 8, we highlight the quality of our deposit franchise by carefully managing our deposit base to prioritize higher quality deposits and reduced lower value deposits. We have improved the liquidity value under the LCR and compressed the size of the balance sheet. Our deposit base is geographically diversified with approximately 55% of our deposits outside the U.S. as you can see in the left column.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">The right side of the page demonstrates the improvement in the liquidity value of our deposit base under the final U.S. LCR rules. Under the LCR deposits are assigned liquidity values based on their stability and the type of clients served, generally 90% to 97% for retail deposits, 60% to 75% for corporate deposits and zero to 75% for financial institutions deposits. Our consumer deposits including retail and commercial banking deposits provided approximately 87% liquidity value consistently over the past year. Our institutional deposits have a 66% liquidity value and have improved steadily as we have reduced the 100% runoff deposits by nearly $30 billion over the past year. At the bottom of the page you can see that our total deposits had LCR liquidity value of 73% trending upwards driven by the reductions in the low LCR value deposits. We will continue to actively manage the quality of our deposit base.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On Slide 9, we show the evolution of our net interest revenue and margin. Net interest revenue in constant dollars has continued to increase steadily. Our net interest margin improved to 292 basis points in the fourth quarter reflecting two primary factors. First, we have issued long-term debt at tighter spreads in maturing our repurchase debt. This contributed to a 70 basis point improvement in our cost of long-term debt over the past year. And second, we have driven the cost of deposits down by reducing customer rates paid on deposits mindful of both the regulatory value of the deposits and local market conditions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Looking to the first half of 2015, we expect our net interest margin to remain more or less flat to full year 2014 levels. As you can see in our appendix Slide 36, we continue to expect the NIM benefit from a rising rate environment. We estimate that 100 basis point parallel rate shock would increase our net interest revenue by $1.8 billion over the first year for a NIM benefit of 11 basis points similar to recent quarters. Our exposures remains concentrated in the shorter end of the curve so that we would not expect material impact from the continued decline in long-term rates that we have recently seen.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On Slide 10, let me cover our long-term debt which is the primary source of funding for our parent company and our broker-dealers and is a valuable liquidity management and supplementary funding tool for our banking subsidiaries. During 2014, our total long-term debt was broadly stable. As we worked to optimize our liquidity position, manage funding cost and position for current regulatory requirements, we increased our bank level debt to strengthen our liquidity position and comply with the U.S. LCR rules. We continued to securitize credit card receivables and we increased our long-term FHLB advances to extend the term structure of the bank level funding at attractive funding costs. Parent company debt decreased slightly during the year. And we continued to refinance high-cost debt with new issuances at lower coupon. In 2015, we expect parent company debt to increase slightly and bank level debt to decline as we position for likely TLAC requirements.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Moving to Slide 11, we cover the bank\u2019s recent securitizations activity and our issuance plans for 2015. Our securitization activity has helped us diversify the bank\u2019s funding sources and optimize the firm\u2019s liquidity position at cost-effective pricing levels. In 2014, we issued $14 billion of securitizations primarily backed by Citi branded credit cards. In 2015 we expect to issue $5 billion to $10 billion in the securitization markets continuing to support this important funding program while also considering the impact of TLAC requirements on our funding strategy which I will come to in a moment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Slide 12 details our debt issuance and liability management activity at our parent company. During 2014 we issued $21 billion of benchmark debt and $11 billion of structured notes. Maturities for the year were $29 billion and we redeemed $10 billion of debt through tenders and other early redemptions resulting in net redemptions of $3 billion. Our issuance during 2014 was diversified as we maintain an active benchmark curve in dollars and we expanded our non-dollar debt to nearly a third of total issuance across a range of tenders. Our $10 billion of liability management activity in 2014 helped us to maintain liquid and efficiently priced benchmark curves while managing our overall funding costs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">For 2015, we expect maturities of $17 billion. We also expect to continue to opportunistically repurchase outstanding debt consistent with past practice of approximately $11 billion for the year. And we expect to issue $20 billion to $25 billion of benchmark debt in 2015 and approximately $10 billion of customer related debt, resulting in net issuance in the range of zero to $5 billion for the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Shown on the bottom of this page, in 2014 we issued approximate $4 billion of preferred stock consistent with 2013 issuance levels, bringing our additional Tier 1 capital to approximately 90 basis points of risk-weighted assets. We expect to issue approximately $4 billion of preferred stock again in 2015 as we continue to prepare for full implementation of capital requirements in 2019.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">In November, the FSB released a consultative document for total loss-absorbing capacity or TLAC. While the document helps to resolve some questions, many uncertainties remain and we are awaiting formal U.S. guidance. On Slide 13, we updated our estimate of total loss-absorbing capacity, which totals $264 billion. The discussion around total loss-absorbing capacity continues to focus on a few questions, what qualifies as loss-absorbing; how much loss absorbing capacity will be required; against what denominator; risk-weighted assets; total leverage assets or something else, is it measured and which entities are subject to bail-in requirement.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Consistent with our prior estimate under the FSB\u2019s proposal, the primary components of TLAC include Common Equity Tier 1 capital, preferred stock, unsecured parent issued senior, and subordinated debt with at least a year remaining until maturity and a small portion of our customer related debt. By contrast, debt issued by operating subsidiaries and secured debt will likely not qualify as TLAC. Additionally, certain structural features of structured notes are viewed unfavorably. We are working with industry groups to evaluate ways of improving the eligibility of these instruments. As of quarter end, we estimate Citigroup\u2019s loss-absorbing capacity to be $264 billion or bit more than 20% of our risk-weighted assets, and 10.6% of our total leverage exposure. All of our estimates and expectations at this point are just that given that we do not yet have a formal proposal from the U.S. regulators.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On Slide 14, we provided some context for a loss-absorbing capacity relative to the potential FSB requirements. Our estimated TLAC of $264 billion represents just over 20% of risk-weighted assets as compared to the FSB\u2019s potential requirement of 20.5% to 24.5%. This range is based on the FSB\u2019s requirement of 16% to 20%, to which we add the capital conservation buffer of 2.5% and our international GSIB surcharge of 2%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">As TLAC rules become clearer, we expect to meet our requirements through an optimization of our regulatory capital position and our funding strategy. First, between now and 2019, we will continue to issue preferred stock and subordinated debt to satisfy our regulatory capital needs, providing roughly $15 billion to $20 billion of additional TLAC over the next four years, as we have previously communicated. Second, as certain aspects of the rules are clarified, we may also be able to adjust the terms of our structured note issuance, allowing us to continue to serve our customers needs without increasing our net issuance or funding cost with as much as $20 billion of benefit over the next four years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">And third, if we need additional loss-absorbing capacity, we can increase our issuance of TLAC eligible senior debt and reduce our outstanding securitizations FHLB advances and repo. The incremental cost of this issuance is marginal, driven by the spread differential between our parent company senior debt and the funding we replace, not the full cost of the debt issued. As a result, we believe that we have a number of avenues to manage the cost of meeting potential TLAC requirements. The Fed released an NPR for the U.S. version of the GSIB surcharge in December.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On Slide 15, we highlighted the key features of the proposal and the drivers of the surcharge calculation. The U.S. NPR builds upon the international GSIB framework, but includes several features that make it more stringent than those standards. Most notably, the Fed\u2019s method to proposal retains four of the five systemic indicator scores under the international approach, but doubles them to determine the surcharge. It then adds a short-term wholesale funding indicator, which is unique to the U.S. proposal. This last indicator was expected to increase capital requirements for firms heavily reliant on repo financing to reduce systemic risk from fire sales. Instead however it heavily penalizes non-operating deposits and is relatively lenient towards repo funding.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Under the LCR rules, these non-operating deposits are effectively placed as cash at the Fed today, therefore presenting no fire sale risk to either the institution or the financial system. The obvious question is how much can banks manage their GSIB surcharge, which relates to some 64 individual line items across the five broad indicators? Some elements of the NPR are well-coordinated with other regulations. So, our ongoing efforts to actually manage our LCR and SLR drivers, for example, should complement our responses to the GSIB rules. For example, non-operating deposits are discouraged under the LCR and the SLR already encourages a smaller balance sheet, incentives consistent with lower scores under the size and interconnectedness indicators. However, other elements of the proposal are incompatible with current regulations and therefore harder to manage. The interconnectedness indicator as an example includes the long-term debt we use to safely fund the firm.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">While we believe the GSIB surcharge was intended to provide incentives to reduce size and complexity, it is difficult for a bank to impact directly the surcharge calculation, because there are additional factors outside management\u2019s control. The proportionality of the calculation means that the impact of any one institution\u2019s actions on its surcharge also depends on the collective actions of the other 74 GSIBs. Furthermore, since the aggregate market indicators are denominated in euros, U.S. institutions are disadvantaged when the dollar strengthens as their dollar denominated balance sheet translates into a larger relative proportion of the other 74 GSIBs. In light of the recent strength of the dollar, we would currently expect a 4% GSIB surcharge under these proposed U.S. rules.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Turning to Slide 16, let me summarize our capital position, which remains among the strongest in the industry. During the quarter, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio declined approximately 20 basis points to 10.5% driven by a pension-related reduction in OCI and an increase in operational risk, RWA. Foreign exchange movement had virtually no impact on our common equity Tier 1 ratio during the quarter. Under the standardized approach, our common equity Tier 1 ratio remained stable at 11.1%. And our supplementary leverage ratio and total leverage exposure were both flat to the prior quarter. Citigroup\u2019s SLR was 6% and Citibank\u2019s estimated SLR remained in excess of 6% as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Turning to Slide 17, I\u2019d like to update you on our liquidity profile. We currently estimate that our LCR under the U.S. rules was 112% in excess of the 100% minimum requirement and up 1 percentage point from last quarter primarily driven by deposit flows and improvements in the quality of our deposit base. Factored into the 112% LCR, we have $413 billion of HQLA predominantly consisting of cash and sovereign debt with only 14% of HQLA categorized as Level 2 assets. In addition to the LCR, we continue to assess the impact of the Basel committee standards regarding the net stable funding ratio, the NSFR, which measures our liquidity under a 12-month stress scenario. The Basel committee released its final rules in the fourth quarter, which better aligned the NSFR and the LCR rules in several important ways. Based on what we know today, we believe we are in compliance with the international NSFR. We expect a proposed rule from the U.S. regulators in 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Moving to our last slide let me summarize four major points. First, we saw momentum across our businesses in 2014 notwithstanding a challenging macroeconomic and market environment. We saw continued progress on a number of our execution priorities including continued utilization of our DTA and a profitable year for Citi Holdings as well as further repositioning and strategic actions to streamline our franchise.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Second, we actively managed our balance sheet maintaining total assets below $1.9 trillion and optimizing our assets and liabilities to support client needs and improve returns. Credit trends remained favorable across both our consumer and corporate credit portfolios. Third, our deposit base remains a key strength as we continue to prioritize our high quality deposits. Our 2015 issuance plans are designed to support our operations and position us to adapt the regulatory changes. And lastly, we have continued to actually manage our balance sheet, our capital and liquidity remained strong.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">This concludes our fixed income review. John and I will be happy to take your questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p7\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of James Ellman with Ascend Capital. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James Ellman-Ascend Capital</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">I guess \u2013 I was hoping you could give us a little information regarding the impact of oils fall on the balance sheet. First of all in terms of the CCAR stress test, will the Fed be asking you to stress oil prices down from $46 to something lower and its impact on your balance sheet?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Hi, it\u2019s John. We have had no indication from the Fed at this point that they are looking to change the parameters that were already issued for CCAR.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James Ellman-Ascend Capital</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. But in general, tell me if I am wrong please, but as I understand it the Fed will take wherever prices are at the beginning of the CCAR process and ask you stress those prices and see what happens to your balance sheet and P&amp;L, correct?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Eric Aboaf</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Jim, it\u2019s Eric. I think the Fed routinely evolves their stress test as part of CCAR. They do it at annual CCAR. They do it in the mid-cycle. They obviously look at current prices of commodities, of equities, of rates. And you have seen that they have over the last couple of years adjusted their stress tests in various ways. And so it\u2019s hard to predict what they will do, it\u2019s not at all a question that they will touch on the current economic environment and evolve their stress tests accordingly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">I think more importantly is the fact that we continuously stress our own balance sheet to take a look at a variety of different changes including the impact of lower oil, so that\u2019s something that we just embed in our normal risk management processes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James Ellman-Ascend Capital</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay, very good. And in addition to just the detail you gave us on energy exposure on the balance sheet today mostly North American related and investment grade, could you just help us understand looking at the loans on the balance sheet, how has fall in oil or how will fall in oil and other commodity prices affect your loans in exporting oriented emerging market countries. And then on the other hand I would imagine there is some benefit to you from falling oil under consumer book both credit card and other if you could help us think about how we should frame that thought process? Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Eric Aboaf</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Yes, it\u2019s Eric. I think clearly we have a set of changes in the global economy with the fall of oil prices. And I think you yourself have actually framed it reasonably well where you have energy and oil exporters, right, it will be who will have lower exports as prices fall. They may have to adjust some of their economic policies and obviously GDP growth and thus borrowing demand for lending in those markets is likely to slow, in particular on the corporate side but even potentially on the consumer side and that\u2019s no real surprise. We have obviously seen swings in the oil exporting economies. I think the other part of that that I think you hinted at yourself is that whether it\u2019s Europe as an importer of oil or the U.S. where oil prices actually factor into discretionary consumer spending, lower oil prices tend to encourage and allow consumers to spend in other areas and that can have positive benefits for the economy. The question will be whether as that runs through the economy, whether consumers choose to borrow a little more or not, but we see it on the margin as positive for the developed economies and thus if that\u2019s the case, we will likely see perhaps a tiny bit, a little bit more borrowing, but it\u2019s very hard to predict one way or the other and obviously consumers with the ability to service their existing loan book. And so it should not change credit quality much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James Ellman-Ascend Capital</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Right. One last quick question and thank you for the time, I just wanted to get an idea that as the U.S. dollar has been strengthening and potentially continues to strengthen against many of the other currencies and countries where you do business. Shouldn\u2019t we expect to see your capital ratios improve as your balance sheet in dollar shrinks? And then also is there an impact on the P&amp;L? Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Eric Aboaf</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">It\u2019s Eric again. The answer is there is no impact on the P&amp;L, because in effect, earnings are translated and we are reasonably and naturally hedged. On the capital side think about it this way, we operate with capital in foreign jurisdictions and risk-weighted assets in foreign jurisdictions. And so we have a natural offset as the dollar either strengthens or weakens in our \u2013 that effectively stabilize our capital ratios. To the extent that we have either a little more or a little less capital in a particular jurisdiction that we offset with vanilla foreign exchange hedges, so that we can insulate those capital movements. And as such, you can see that our capital ratios driven by currency swings have stayed almost flat relative to any real measure. We actually have on Page 35 you see a good summary of that. You see the foreign exchange currency translation, which is the net effect of currency movements on our capital ratios and you see we run our capital ratios within a couple basis points, right, even with these quite substantial swings in the dollar that we have seen over the last few quarters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James Ellman-Ascend Capital</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Very good. Thanks again so much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Eric Aboaf</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Our pleasure.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question comes from the line of David Knutson with Legal and General. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Knutson-Legal and General</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hi, good morning. I wanted to I guess follow-up on the one of the earlier questions and that\u2019s in regards to your emerging market risk exposures. In your slide deck, you break it down between consumer and corporate. And I guess when you think about the different regions, it looks like maybe Latin America, Brazil and Mexico specifically are probably a little bit weaker. How will your franchises specifically the consumer franchise and then the corporate franchise? What are your expectations? Will we see weakness first in the consumer or maybe in the corporate depending on how you are exposed or what are your thoughts going forward given that those two economies do have a fairly high reliance on oil revenues for their budgets?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Eric Aboaf</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">David, it\u2019s Eric. I think the recent context, the last 2 years is actually helpful, right. We have not been living in a particularly high growth timeline or particularly the growing environment. And so as a result, what I think is \u2013 let me keep going. I think what you see is that the economies have been fairly stable. We have got an echo. We are trying to sort that out. I am going to keep going. We have seen economies that are fairly stable. And so I don\u2019t think that this particular change is out of the ordinary of what we have seen over the last 2 years, right. We have seen quite modest growth and this kind of throws another twist in that equation. If you kind of want to play it out, I think it\u2019s easier to describe the global economy not from an emerging market versus developed economy standpoint, but from oil exporters versus non-oil exporters because I think that is where there may be a little more change in growth rates. And as I mentioned that will likely put a bit more stress on corporate exposures to the energy industry and tend to either be neutral or positive for consumer lending book.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question comes from line of Ryan O'Connell with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ryan O'Connell-Morgan Stanley</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thanks very much. First, just to follow-up on the remarks on TLAC, which are very, very helpful, I think what you said Eric is that there is so much is going over the dollar, etcetera. You are now expecting that that GSIB surcharge would more likely be 4% rather than 2%. So, if I heard that right, then we should really be thinking of a range about 22.5% to 26.5% right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Eric Aboaf</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Ryan, it\u2019s Eric. That is correct, right. In the GSIB area, right the international rules were set at a certain level. The U.S. rules effectively doubled that, and that puts us in the 4% range and GSIB. I think the question on TLAC is that for now, all we have is an FSB, the Financial Stability Board document. It\u2019s quite an outline, and it\u2019s a bit unclear how that outline will evolve, how the U.S. versus international GSIB may factor in. And so I think you have mentioned one potential scenario, but I think there is a number of scenarios that are possible for TLAC as we go forward. And part of what we are trying to do here on the page and in the discussion is just lay out that we have a set of natural tailwinds to help us confirm to certain levels of TLAC within this range, but also have tools that are disposal that are particularly expensive to adapt if necessary.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ryan O'Connell-Morgan Stanley</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Understood and it\u2019s a very helpful layout. If I could just, in your footnote one, which you say is that \u2013 let\u2019s say there is a 100 basis point increase, so that would be debt. Okay, that is pretty clear. Then further increases beyond the first 100, would be expected with common equity Tier 1, so I guess maybe you could expand on that a little bit?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Eric Aboaf</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yes. It\u2019s Eric again. I think as you know under the current GSIB rules, we have run that \u2013 we have a 9% requirement with a buffer we run at 9.5% or we would need to run at 9.5%. Because we already run at 10.5% as of this last quarter, right, we have a 100 basis point there that is satisfying TLAC rules. To the extent that the GSIB just moves from 2% to 3%, and we have the equity necessary, but the natural add or requirement to TLAC would effectively be 100 basis points of debt and so that kind of flows through naturally. Any GSIB requirement over and above what might be 3% now to potentially say 4%, right, would then naturally require us to add capital to the balance sheet to retain more capital to the balance sheet of about 100 basis points and that would directly support TLAC and so that in a way it would be the way it would factor through.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ryan O'Connell-Morgan Stanley</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Sure. And then one last one, and again apologies in advance, but just as you look at the various TLAC needs, I think what you are saying here is let\u2019s take the senior debt for example, incremental senior debt $10 billion, $25 billion that\u2019s over the span over the next four years right that\u2019s not per year, that\u2019s over the span of next four years in the aggregate?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Eric Aboaf</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Ryan, that\u2019s exactly right. The range here we laid out just to give you all a way to model this. $10 billion to $25 billion over the course of four years is what $3 billion to $6 billion per year, right. You know that we issued typically $20 billion to $25 billion of benchmark debt per year. You know, that in the past we and other large banks have issued $30 billion, $40 billion, $50 billion of debt per year. So, we know there is enormous demand in the marketplace for our debt. And adding something like $3 billion to $6 billion per year on a base of $20 billion to $25 billion, while it is more, right, we don\u2019t think is a big \u2013 would be a particularly big change. I think the other context is that as you know as we issue debt we have order books that tend to be oversubscribed by a factor 3x, 4x, 5x, alright which gives you a sense for the depth of the market that we have access to. So like you said it\u2019s kind of $3 billion to $6 billion as we have modeled out per year and something that we think that while it\u2019s not zero could be easily absorbed in the marketplace.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ryan O'Connell-Morgan Stanley</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. Great. Thanks very much Eric.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question comes from the line of Robert Smalley with UBS. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Robert Smalley-UBS</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Hi. Thanks very much and thanks for putting together this deck, it\u2019s very informative. Thanks John and Eric and Peter. Couple of questions on Slide 28 and then one or two to follow-up on TLAC if that\u2019s alright?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Sure.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Robert Smalley-UBS</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Do you have any breakdown, I am looking down in the lower left hand box, do you have any breakdown of midstream and downstream exposures. I see that you have E&amp;P here, do you break it down that way as well?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">This is John. E&amp;P is about as far as we are breaking it down right now, but maybe I can help you with some other questions that you have got.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Robert Smalley-UBS</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. Well, then let me just stick with this box here. The second line item the 14.7, that\u2019s the \u2013 I am assuming that\u2019s independent drillers, technology, services, etcetera?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Robert Smalley-UBS</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. So that\u2019s probably where the industry is going to see problems first as we have a lot of new and highly levered companies there, can you give us an idea of how much of this 14.7 has been classified or in any way categorized as non-performing or troubled at this point?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Actually most people are focused more on the E&amp;P type of companies, the phrase that you also [indiscernible] closer to the drill bit.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Robert Smalley-UBS</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Right.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And that would be \u2013 that would actually be in the top line that you are looking at which is the 6.5 and the 18.2. So I want to make sure that I am being responsive to your concern but I want to make sure that I understand where your concern is directed.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Robert Smalley-UBS</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Sure. Well, my concern is more with some of the smaller and mid-sized companies that may not necessarily be first order but those that could fall away pretty quickly due to lower demand?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">That would actually be more in the top line then.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Robert Smalley-UBS</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We are looking at the 6.5 and 18.2. So there when we take a look at our exposures to E&amp;P companies as a group they are also predominantly investment grade at over 80%. And with the funded exposures to the E&amp;P companies at about 75% investment grade, so again very heavily weighted toward investment grade. And when we do lend to non-investment grade E&amp;P companies, we tend to do so under radio a reserve based lending structure which allows us then to adjust the borrowing base on a periodic basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Robert Smalley-UBS</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Right. And my understanding is that borrowing base gets for a lot of this will be recalculated in the spring around April or so?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I don\u2019t have any exact data in mind. It\u2019s usually every six months or so it gets recalibrated.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Robert Smalley-UBS</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">But from your comments earlier you are kind of \u2013 you look through that and you don\u2019t wait for that recalculation you are doing your own work and seeing where that comes out long before they \u2013 long before you \u2013 the companies themselves recalculate the borrowing base?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Absolutely.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Robert Smalley-UBS</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. One other question commodity related, do you break out your mining exposure at all coal, copper, etcetera?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">No.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Robert Smalley-UBS</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. And then I just want to follow-up on Ryan\u2019s question on not TLAC understanding that your amount of debt that incremental debt that you have to issue isn\u2019t really that much given market access and what you have outstanding, but you won\u2019t be issuing this debt in a vacuum. You will have competitors who will be doing the same thing and in a few cases, they will be required to do much more than you. What\u2019s your strategy in terms of issuance? Are you going to try and frontload some of this in order not to pushup funding cost as a result of industry wide supply? And do you factor the rest of the industry in when you look at your funding costs for the incremental debt in the out years?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Eric Aboaf</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Rob, it\u2019s Eric. Fair questions. I think we are going to be deliberate here on TLAC right in the sense that this is international proposal. There isn\u2019t any U.S. guidance on that. Hopefully, we will get some in the first half of this year. And I think we need to know more about what the rules going to look like before we jump in and adapt. Obviously, we have a history of adapting, but we need to see more the rules. I think secondly, you are going to see us adapt in a paste manner, because adding a lot of debt upfront and then just keeping it stable before we need it is expensive, not because of the marginal cost of debt, but because you have got more debt outstanding. You have seen in one of the earlier slides on preferreds, we know what we need to do on preferreds, but we have been deliberate, we have been paced, we have been issuing $1 billion a quarter and have obviously been able to do that at nice rates and without flooding the market. I think we\u2019d expect to do that, because partly we want to keep our cost of funding as low as possible. We also don\u2019t want to disrupt holders of our debt who are \u2013 who have got positions who wanted to trade well in the secondary market.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I think the third part of it is while there maybe some uptick in industry issuance, we know that there are some GSIBs out there in large banks who are because of their nature balance sheet structure have enough TLAC debt. And so there is a group that won\u2019t be issuing anymore. I think that\u2019s something to factor in. There will certainly be some that will be issuing, but when we talk to our investors, they tend to have not only aggregate limits for FI debt, but also single name limits. And we think that, that diversification that they are looking for will suit us and will actually play to our advantage in the sense that they really will compare us against what their capacity might be in our particular name. And we think as a result it will be more of a comparison as we describe the kind of potentially $3 billion to $6 billion per year, but off of a base that we are ready to issue of $20 million to $25 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Robert Smalley-UBS</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">That\u2019s great. And again, thanks for all the information here.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Eric Aboaf</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Good. Our pleasure.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question comes from the line of David Jiang with Prudential. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Jiang-Prudential</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Hi, my questions on TLAC, Eric on Page 14 where you break out the three different types of TLAC needs, the customer related debt re-issuance, how do you plan to achieve that? Is it basically issuing vanilla benchmark debt to replace the customer-related structure notes or is there something you can do to transform the customer-related notes into eligible TLAC?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Eric Aboaf</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">David, it\u2019s Eric. It\u2019s more likely to be the latter because that\u2019s the area we want to explore. The very initial TLAC proposal again from the FSB, right, it\u2019s not a detailed rule it\u2019s really more of an outline, right, than a detailed rule. Effectively, this allows any debt with any structural feature. So, any debt that might have a \u2013 that may parallel or have some reference to an equity index or rates index or an FX index is automatically disallowed. We find that surprising to be honest in the sense that, that is good debt, it has a term structure oftentimes at 3, 4, 5 years. And in our discussions with industry groups and with various supervisors, what we have learned from them is they have some openness to explore this and to consider certain types of customer debt or structured notes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And part of the reason we think they have an incentive to do that is they like us to diversify our funding, the diversifying between benchmark notes to typically institutional investors and then structured notes that typically go to high net worth is a way for them and then for us to ensure the diversification in our funding. As a result what we are doing is we are working through with them and through the industry groups what is it about structured notes is it about, is it potentially, for example, about the difficulty in valuing the structured component of the note at the time of bail-in. If that\u2019s the case as an example, can we structure around that? For example, can we just have a knockout feature, where the note reverts to par at any bail-in situation? Right, that\u2019s the kind of adjustment we could make in our structured notes, we and others in the industry could make and the kind of adapting that we would look to accomplish.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Jiang-Prudential</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Do you think these changes would diminish the capacity of that channel, the ability to issue the size?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Eric Aboaf</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">It may on the margin, but it\u2019s \u2013 on the other hand, this is a pretty robust channel through a series of institutions, high net worth. It\u2019s broad-based between the U.S. and internationally. It\u2019s a sophisticated set of investors who would naturally understand what a knockout feature is or a back to par feature, right. It\u2019s kind of the simplest of turning this to be a little more vanilla and we can imagine that, that is actually something that we could transition to fairly easily, but let me just remind you, we are speculating here. We don\u2019t know how the rules will be written. For all we know, the rules will say structured notes, because they provide diversification to the large and medium-sized firms would be included under the U.S. rules, where we are just trying to work through it and so you have got some of our early thoughts here.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Jiang-Prudential</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And then lastly given that the other lever to pull is the Basel III RWA denominator in figuring out TLAC. On Page 29, I think there is about 14% of the total RWAs in Citi Holdings and that\u2019s been shrinking consistently over the last few years. Is that \u2013 what can we expect that number to go down to in the 2018 timeframe when you calculate the TLAC number?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Eric Aboaf</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Good, David. Clearly, RWA will be important and how it evolves whether it\u2019s TLAC or capital ratios or leverage ratios, it\u2019s going to be an important factor. I think what you have seen us try to do is run with relatively flat RWA over the past, whether we have had some upticks for a bit of operational risk. We think we have got a good bit of that behind us or all of that behind us to be fair. We have some tailwinds and that holdings will reduce our RWAs over time as we sell and it matures out. So, that\u2019s a benefit. And then we will have some natural growth in our client activity. And I think what we would like to see at least for now, I am not going to forecast out 4, 5 years, but we like to run RWA as flattish and clearly time will tell. Right, it will depend on how the economy picks up, how borrowing demand picks up, how inventories change, but I don\u2019t think we are expecting we can really predict that far out. I think for the immediate future seeing RWA as flattish is probably a good construct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Jiang-Prudential</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Got it. And then sorry, one last thing, have you thought about how you plan to issue vanilla benchmark debt in terms of kind of your average duration, because given that if you can extend your durations, you can have less debt coming due each year, which obviously doesn\u2019t count as TLAC, especially when you are looking out to 2018? Is that something you would consider?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Eric Aboaf</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">David, it\u2019s Eric. It\u2019s something we are obviously exploring. You know, we run at good durations here, 7 years is our average WAM. We have been issuing with a WAM of that level, which if you think about in its simplest terms if we issue 5s and 10s that averages out to 7.5. If we issue 5 and 10s which are the core of our issuance right, that actually gets us into 2019 right and into the TLAC sort of value window even with issuances this year. So, there is a natural way we can fill up TLAC with the current issuances. Would we try to lengthen out the WAM? We are always doing a little bit of analysis on is the cost as a credit curve worth some other benefit. And I think you can imagine we will continue to do that. I think for now we feel pretty comfortable with our WAM that we have of about 7 years. We think it gives us a good balance between cost, liquidity, which is obviously critical and these new rules and are likely to stay in that range.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Jiang-Prudential</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Great, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald-Bernstein</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Hi, good morning guys. Thanks. This is very helpful for the equity guys as well. John, just kind of a separate comment on different topic number of banks have commented about the impact of the shock to the FX markets after the Swiss national bank currency decision and there are some press reports indicating that Citi may have lost some money. Just wondering do you have any upside to comment on that, all those stories, just either specifically on those numbers or just generally in terms of the impact of that event on your FX business?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yes, John. Yes, obviously last week\u2019s move by the Swiss Central Bank was unanticipated. And as a result, we did see an unusually large move in the value of the franc in a very short period of time. It\u2019s not unusual that our role as market maker to support our clients, we did have some positions and I would say that we did experience a modest loss.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald-Bernstein</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay, but manageable in the context of\u2026.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Overall, overall though, since that event, we have seen good activity \u2013 good activity levels from our customers in the FX markets and we are going to continue to work closely with our clients to help them manage their currency needs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald-Bernstein</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. Eric, thanks for that helpful teaching on TLAC and the GSIB proposal from the U.S. Quick follow-up on that? On the GSIB and your estimate of 4% surcharge that seems higher than what was implied by the Fed\u2019s summary comments that all but one bank are currently above their minimums? I guess there is lots of reasons where your numbers could be different than what the Fed and the Fed, of course, didn\u2019t tell us our numbers, but could some of that difference be attributable to the FX issue that you described or to asset growth since they ran their numbers and you run yours, just any idea why your number might be a little higher than what was at least implied by their comments?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Well, John, it\u2019s John. When you take a look at the significant move of the euro versus the dollar, the dollar strengthening against the euro, that is driving a lot of things.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald-Bernstein</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">It\u2019s a key determinant of the whole GSIB methodology and one that is very, very difficult to control. It\u2019s when you look at what the Fed did that the relative nature of the proportional approach that was embedded in the original FSB calculation already caused many to consider it to be a somewhat flawed methodology. As such, it was curious that the Fed in proposing a new surcharge for U.S. banks that they would choose to, in effect double down on an arguably flawed methodology, especially one that would cause a U.S. bank\u2019s surcharge to increase merely because of the dollar strengthening. In some ways, the ECB\u2019s quantitative easing program probably added 50 basis points to every U.S. banks\u2019 GSIB surcharge.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald-Bernstein</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yes, okay, got it. That\u2019s helpful perspective. And one last follow-up John, this one is for you as well, understanding that your goal of efficiency improvement for Citicorp in 2015 kind of implies positive operating leverage for 2015? And also understanding that how your expenses actually come out will depend on revenues, what are some of the expense levers or tailwinds that you have to lean on in Citicorp for 2015 in terms of reducing the core expenses relative to the core operating expense that we saw in fourth quarter? If we looked at that as the exit rate on the core operating expense, what kind of levers or tailwinds you have to lean on this year depending on where revenues shake out?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Well, John, a lot of it is already embedded in the \u2013 in just making sure that we get the full results of all the actions that we took throughout 2014. We took a sizable amount of repositioning charges last year, including a sizable charge in the fourth quarter itself. Those expense reductions will manifest themselves during the four quarters of 2015. And we think that, that in and of itself gives us a good deal of tailwind. Beyond that, we have obviously got the ability then to if revenues are lagging we have investments that are baked into our 2015 budgets that we will cut back on. There are additional recapacitization actions that we can take. So, we think that we have got several levers that we can pull on, but a lot of those levers have already been pulled, because we are going to deliver on making sure that the repositioning savings come through in 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald-Bernstein</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. So, just understanding if we are looking at the fourth quarter exit rate relative to that, there is still some savings to come that\u2019s not in the fourth quarter run-rate, correct?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Absolutely. As a matter of fact, I think I don\u2019t have the \u2013 exactly what the comments were during the call, but as we indicated we have delivered about $2.7 billion I think of savings of the full amount of savings for the repositioning actions that we have taken. We expect those repositioning actions to actually deliver about $3.4 billion. So, we have got an additional $700 million of annual savings that are not reflected in that fourth quarter run-rate. Now, I am not going to be able to deliver all $700 million in the first quarter, but that $700 million will be delivered during the course of the year. And so that again should give us some good movement going forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald-Bernstein</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Got it. So, that\u2019s incremental to the fourth quarter. And then just one final, there also were some kind of one-timers in that fourth quarter number as well, right, so that should help relative to the kind of printed fourth quarter number?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Correct. I mean, what we have said was we \u2013 with the additional \u2013 we had about a $200 million core operating expense increase over the third quarter and we said about three quarters of that that was either one-time in nature or already contemplated in our 2015 expense base.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald-Bernstein</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Got it. Okay. Thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay, John.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question comes from the line of Scott Cavanagh with APG. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Scott Cavanagh-APG</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Good afternoon, guys and I appreciate the fixed income presentation. It\u2019s very important and I want to recognize that you guys are the leaders for the disclosure and hopefully will be mirrored by the rest of your peers in the money centers. So, first question, looking at TLAC issuance another dive into this. When I think about the refinancing of the client, the structure notes, should we be looking at more of a run-rate of around just under $12 billion versus $6 billion if we just assume it\u2019s all issued in unsecured issuance, plain vanilla?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Eric Aboaf</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Scott, it\u2019s Eric. No, I think for now we should keep those categories as separate, because it\u2019s hard for us to imagine at least to start with that structure notes. We are going to be effectively outlawed by a TLAC requirement. As I mentioned before, they provide real diversification to funding for banks. They provide offerings for investors. They help \u2013 some investors actually invest or hedge their positions. So, I think for the time being, I think we probably should expect that, that some component of the customer-related or structure notes will count. I think we have given you a range, right. We have outstanding about $28 billion. How much of that could count? Right now, on a simplistic basis, it\u2019s 4, but could it be 14 or 24, it could be and that\u2019s kind of we want to see a little more as that comes out.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Scott Cavanagh-APG</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. Then when we think about the timing of the NPR and the impact from the potential rating agency methodology changes, how should we be thinking about that in terms of a timing, is there a duration component so not overweighting the shorter duration securities. Then how the rating agency methodology changes will actually impact?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Eric Aboaf</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Let me take that from the end of the question that you asked Scott. The rating agencies have actually to their credit been in front of this question of bail-in debt at the parent versus operating company debt this \u2013 they have evolved their rating systems. I think everyone of the three agencies have cut over to a process where they think about debt as open to bail-in. They have tiered their ratings accordingly. They have been quite public in that. And so I think there isn\u2019t much more to come from there that is going to impact investors from the rating agencies. I think the rating agencies have actually been leaders in this area and they have properly sensed the evolution of the government and regulatory practices here. So I think there isn\u2019t that much on that front that will change the equation. And as such the real question will be how the U.S. begins to develop a set of rules for TLAC. They are clearly going to put a set of rules out there. We expect in the first half of the year. So there will be proposed rules open for comments. So clearly we are giving them some through the industry association the industry is providing some initial feedback on the FSB rules to the Fed and our other supervisors in the U.S. And again post the proposed rule we will do that again, so more to come on this one probably.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Scott Cavanagh-APG</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. If I could sneak in one more question switching to the energy, when I look at the E&amp;P bucket and look at the funded versus the total exposure. Is this include \u2013 when I think about the bucket of companies that you provide services to, is this \u2013 how do I think about on a size basis is this like an Exxon type of size of is this a very small bucket type of company when I think about the exposures there I mean there is some you very helpfully put out that vast majority is investment grade but that probably won\u2019t be for long that so many are investment grade how we do think about it from that perspective?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yes. It\u2019s John, the companies that will be included in that first line are a \u2013 of a variety of sizes. And so I can\u2019t give you a specific. But there are some that are medium and some that are large and some that you might consider small. But again the \u2013 80% of the exposure is investment grade. We do look at it on a constant basis. And it\u2019s something that we are very, very closely monitoring.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Scott Cavanagh-APG</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thank you very much for your time and for doing this call. Greatly appreciate it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thank you, Scott.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question comes from the Mark Kehoe with Goldman Sachs Asset Management. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mark Kehoe-Goldman Sachs Asset Management</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Good morning. Just one more last question on TLAC is this in terms of the $3 billion to $6 billion of additional annual debt issuance, do think you would more likely do a larger chunkier deals or be a larger kind of frequent \u2013 more frequent issuer. And then coming to the regulator question is do you think the regulators will mandate [indiscernible] language to be included within the prospectuses of this bail-in [indiscernible] noting the fact that bondholders may be written down in the event of an adverse outcome?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Eric Aboaf</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Mark it\u2019s Eric, I want to see what regulators specify I think for now. I think they have been clear in their public statements that debt is subject to bail-in, that\u2019s how the Dodd-Frank rules are written in the law and it\u2019s not clear at all that indentures need to change other than the obvious risk factors that we have been indentures that already capture a variety of different outcomes. So I think rating agencies as was just mentioned have been quite clear on this. So we don\u2019t see potentially need to change or specify specific indentures and debt. And I think you all as investors obviously know that in the worst case that that can be bailed in and that\u2019s part of the new financial system and that\u2019s there for a reason and that will protect the taxpayer and the system as a result.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">In terms of how we might adjust our issuances and we have been talking about potentially and this is all potentially subject to change $2 billion, $3 billion to $6 billion per year over and above $20 billion to $25 billion program that we have today. I think you would see us continue to do it in the way that we have done in a paste manner, I think was first observation I would make in a disciplined manner. You have seen us do a number of deals that are in the $1 billion, $1.5 billion range. We like that, because we can connect directly with investors. We can satisfy their needs of either currency or tenor and we think it actually doing deals of that size gives us a good discipline on pricing, which obviously is important to us as we manage the balance sheet and to our equity owners. So, I think you will see us continue to be disciplined. We have got a good reputation of doing that. I think we have an expectation of that and that you can see continue.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mark Kehoe-Goldman Sachs Asset Management</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Right, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question comes from the line of Hima Inguva with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Hima Inguva-Bank of America Merrill Lynch</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Thanks a lot. I am still new to the sector, so I apologize if I ask something basic. I do have to say that this is one of the best fixed income investor conferences or meetings I have attended. Just a quick question I guess follow-up on Slide 12, the benchmark $20 billion to $25 billion, I am looking for a split between sub and senior historically I see that 2013/14 has been 15% to 20% between sub and senior, so any guidance there would be greatly appreciated?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Eric Aboaf</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Hima, it\u2019s Eric here. We typically don\u2019t really give much more guidance here, why, because we want to retain a little bit of flexibility in terms of the mix of issuances. What I would tell you is we tend to be relatively consistent in how we issue. We do that for obvious reasons, because then our investors know more or less what to expect. Then I\u2019d point you to the past few years, I think that\u2019s \u2013 that gives you a good range of the kind of activity you might see in senior or sub or thereabouts. I think it\u2019s a good indication.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Hima Inguva-Bank of America Merrill Lynch</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Thanks a lot. Again, thank you very much. Appreciate it. Very excited to be part of the community.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Eric Aboaf</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Your next question comes from the line of Jacob Habibi with Invesco. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jacob Habibi-Invesco</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Thank you. Most of my questions around TLAC have been asked and answered. The only note that I would want to add is that according to some of my calculations here just looking at the senior stack only, I come up with potential issuance of anywhere between $10 billion and $62 billion based on a range of 16% to 20% TLAC and that\u2019s taking out all of the different CET1 buffers that have been ruled ineligible. So, I am just trying to square on the high-end there that $62 billion versus the numbers that you have on your Slide 14, where it really only adds to about $45 billion on the high-end of potential issuance needs between the restructuring of the structured notes and incremental senior debt that would replace other forms of funding?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Eric Aboaf</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Jacob, it\u2019s Eric. I think Page 14 might give you a roadmap and obviously we could follow-up with our Investor Relations team, but we labeled the dollar amount of total TLAC that we need right, that\u2019s the various debt and equity components altogether, the $264 billion. We compare that on an RWA basis. And then we give a range of the potential requirements in dollar terms, $66 billion to $318 billion. And I think if you do the math there, we are guessing that total TLAC needs will be somewhere between $2 billion and $64 billion, which is in line with what I think you have estimated, but what\u2019s very important is that there is a natural tailwind from some of our existing activities in preferred and sub debt which I think some haven\u2019t factored in previously and then maybe a little bit of what you are working through.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And Jacob, it\u2019s John. So, even then if you took, if the U.S. additional surcharge comes through and it is an additional 2% as we indicated it could be that would of course add another say $26 billion on to a TLAC requirement at the upper end of the range, it went all the way to say $26.5 billion, but that would get you then from what we are looking at as $54 billion to may be $80 billion. And it\u2019s just hard to see that we need to $62 billion of the senior in order to fill up the $80 billion. But as Eric said if you want to work with our \u2013 with Peter in Investor Relations he will be more than happy to walk you through the numbers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jacob Habibi-Invesco</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay, sure. I was just trying to isolate the senior stack alone and so sort of backing it out that implies senior of anywhere between 8% to 12% risk-weighted assets, so I am \u2013 so we are looking at very simplistically on that terms and just assuming that any buffers that you want to build to CET1 or AT1 whatever those may be. I guess I am not assuming that you are going to use those buffers and apply them to maintain I guess a smaller senior stack, but would that be an incorrect assumption, are you going to be using some of those?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Why don\u2019t you give Peter a call in Investor Relations and he can help walk you through all the detailed numbers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jacob Habibi-Invesco</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Rather than have us try to work through a model right here on the phone.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jacob Habibi-Invesco</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay, alright. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Your next question comes from the line of Louise Pitt with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Louise Pitt-Goldman Sachs</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Hi, good morning guys. Thanks very much for call and for the additional it is very helpful. I know I am going to beat a dead horse on the question on TRAC, but there is nothing in your deductions for other GSIBs TLAC debt holdings, is that just because you don\u2019t have enough information right now because you don\u2019t have any?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Eric Aboaf</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Louise, it\u2019s Eric, fair question. We have been working through the deductions and obviously the FSB paper is quite broad-based. I think as you have mentioned there is a deduction that they referenced for the cross holdings of debt and equity of other GSIBs. For us that would be worth potentially 0.5 point it\u2019s doing that calculation, is it a daily calculation, is it in the period calculation where it could be done in different ways. I think the reason we haven\u2019t explicitly reduced these amounts by that is really for two reasons.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">First, if there is an active deduction for that it\u2019s one of the easiest things on the balance sheet to manage down and actually to reduce our holdings. And you can imagine like for other activities we will intervene to a reasonable amount because that might be a costly deduction. The other is that in discussions that the industry groups have begun to have with some of our regulators, they seem to have an openness to potentially thinking about a quarter or a certain amount that is allowable for these holdings of in inventory of debt or equity of other firms.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And the reason is that obviously when we market make in the debt or equity of another firm, we are helping create liquidity and transparency in the marketplace that has some benefits for many investors and for the Fed as they oversee the financial system. And so we could see a way where it is possible, but again it\u2019s highly uncertain, at this point we don\u2019t have any real rules. We can see where it\u2019s possible that there is a certain reasonable amount that as along as it\u2019s diversified potentially across counterparties that we hold that might be allowable.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Louise Pitt-Goldman Sachs</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you. In terms of the securities that will be TLAC eligible obviously you have excluded anything with less than one year to maturity, but in thinking that they will still be at hold co and while they may not be TLAC eligible they would be bail-in of all under the tons of the regulators\u2019 view of those securities, they will still be outstanding in parity pursue at the time of any resolution. So is there any move to actually require all securities with maturities of less then one year to not actually be at the hold cos so that there is no cross default and therefore fund everything in less than one year at an operating company?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I think we have seen some \u2013 a bit of chatter on that question, but it seems pretty straightforward for us that if you have debt that was issued at 10 years and 9 years later is rolling down to under a year that\u2019s debt that you have outstanding. And whether regulators think of it as TLAC eligible, it\u2019s up to their discretion. As it goes below the 1-year basis, will it still get bailed in? I am guessing probably, but they obviously don\u2019t want to count on it. So, potentially that\u2019s why it\u2019s excluded, but we don\u2019t see any particular reason why having debt that either rolls down or other small amounts of short-term liabilities that may exist in the parent would create an issue, although maybe there is \u2013 we don\u2019t see a particular reason there. So, that would be an issue.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Louise Pitt-Goldman Sachs</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">So, you don\u2019t see a move to issue sort of 10 non-call 9 securities or 11 non-call 10 to give you the option and forecast?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Eric Aboaf</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Louise, that would be a little premature at this point given we have an FSB kind of whitepaper, that\u2019s what it feels like. And we don\u2019t even have a proposed U.S. rule, so not at this point.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Louise Pitt-Goldman Sachs</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay. Just a couple of other questions. On your opportunistic redemptions that you have listed there in the past, it potentially hasn\u2019t just been a coupon or clearly visible to the investor base rationale as to why certain securities have been in any LME transactions? Is there anymore additional color you can give us in terms of what might drive those opportunistic redemptions?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Eric Aboaf</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Yes, Louise, it\u2019s Eric again. I think you are referring to the redemptions and the liability management that you see on Page 12. There are really two drivers for the bonds that we tend to choose. The first is that we tend to find that we have bonds over time that trade outside of the natural credit curve. Sometimes that\u2019s rolled down. Sometimes that\u2019s debt that may have \u2013 may have smaller outstandings or where you don\u2019t see much secondary market activity, but what we routinely do and for those who are interested in understanding or even guessing at what we might buyback, what we routinely do is ask the question across all the outstanding debt that exists across the credit curve what might be trading north of the \u2013 of what would be that average or perhaps the top quartile credit curve that you could draw through that mix. So, that\u2019s the first one and you will see that we have been \u2013 we routinely tend to retire that debt.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">The second factor is the basis. And this one I think tends to be a little more volatile and a little harder to predict. But as we look at the currency basis between dollars and euros or dollars and yen or where we may have issued that also gives us an ability to retire debt and then reissue right out on a less expensive level. And so to the extent that I described the first bit of analysis we do is a credit curve, we do a merit set of that analysis on a basis adjusted credit curve and we find that there is debt that we could buyback and then reissue at more normalized levels. So, those are the two drivers and we are happy to show you how some of our practices are pretty, pretty straightforward. I think that might give you some guidance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Louise Pitt-Goldman Sachs</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay, that\u2019s really helpful. Thanks again guys.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">You are welcome.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Eric Aboaf</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Your next question comes from the line of Pri de Silva with CreditSights. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Pri de Silva-CreditSights</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Good afternoon and thank you again for providing all this information. It\u2019s very helpful. I don\u2019t mean to beat a dead horse, I am going to stay clear of TLAC, but I want to get a sense of how should we look at Citi\u2019s internal incremental capital buffer given all the movements? Also based on our internal estimates, it looks like [indiscernible] bump up in their FSB GSIB capital buckets. So given that, the movement that we see due to exchange rates, how should we look at the capital buffers? And all of this is assuming that the Fed will not implement the capital conservation and the GSIB buffers into the CCAR process?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Until we get some more clarity on what the final U.S. GSIB surcharge will be, we are still planning to operate with a 50 basis point buffer above our stated requirements which would be the 9%, the 4.5% plus the 2.5%, plus the 2% which gets you to the 9%. And then we are planning to run at 9.5% with the 50 basis point buffer. And that\u2019s all I can tell you right now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Pri de Silva-CreditSights</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And Eric how should we look at in the event the Fed incorporates a capital conservation buffer and the GSIB buffer into the CCAR process I know it will be a long drawn out process, but how should we look at capital requirements for banks as a whole not just Citi but the eight GSIBs in that case?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Eric Aboaf</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">We will have to cross that bridge when we\u2026</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Pri de Silva-CreditSights</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Great. Thank you very much guys.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Your next question comes from the line of Irving Franco with Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Monteleone-Barclays</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Hey, good afternoon. It\u2019s actually Brian Monteleone. I won\u2019t ask you guys another TLAC question, but I did have a question on the preferred stock. The preferred stock items $8 billion to $10 billion. When I look at the $10 billion in preferred it\u2019s outstanding and $2 billion the Citi ends relative to RWAs which Eric you said earlier you expect it to kind of remain flat, to me that implied about $7 billion of incremental supply, so I just want to make sure are you still planning to operate at the 150 basis points or what\u2019s driving that small diversions from kind of 7 versus 8 to 10?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Eric Aboaf</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Brian I think it\u2019s just a little bit of rounding, right. We are at 90 basis points of prefs today. We need to get to 150 basis points. We would plan on operating at 150 basis points. We obviously because of the non-call 5, non-call 10 features of some of the prefs there is always going to be some that we consider buying back and so we obviously would need to factor that in a little bit. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s particularly significant as we have started more recently they should perhaps. But I think you are in the right range 7, 8, 9, 10 it is somewhere in that area I think is fair to model.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Monteleone-Barclays</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Okay. We should assume that 150 basis points is the target and that the Citi ends will remain part of that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Eric Aboaf</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">That\u2019s correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Monteleone-Barclays</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Okay. And the second question just around energy, so you guys have kind of noted your confidence, the quality of the energy portfolio that you have, but I guess if the prices will stay this low for say a couple of years, can you talk about what you are see in your stress tests maybe that the pockets where you do have some concerns, then also some of structural protections you have, your ability to take collateral things like that that gave you comfort and kind of how you expect things to play out?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Eric Aboaf</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Brian, it\u2019s Eric. I think there is obviously intense focus you are at Citi. But I think every bank as we consider oil and you can imagine we are stressing oil from we stressed it first on the 50s and to 40 I am sure we are working on stressing it to 30, 20 and 10 right for operating purposes. And then we are going to stress it when it goes back up, right because that\u2019s going to create dislocations not just happiness on the energy industry or in the stock market. So I think first you should imagine we do a lot of stress testing a lot of different ways across various parts of the energy supply chain as we talked about earlier and around the world because it can have different impacts on different economies, I don\u2019t want to get into great detail because it\u2019s a long, long conversation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">I think at the same time we actively risk manage these books. And I think we would try to give you a little bit of that taste in the sense that our underwriting considers not just spot rates of pricing in oil but a range. John mentioned some of the collateral that we revalue so that we have the right amounts of protection and can either call loans or have them adjusted. We clearly have limit structures not just for aggregate energy but multiple levels down across different sectors of energy or different quality types of energy companies. And then obviously we have an ability as we see any concerns or changes we can certainly have an ability to sell certain portions of loans. We have done that before.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">You have seen us talk about that as we have adjusted our books, we could buy protection in the CDS markets. We could enter into a series of different actions to adjust our position. So there is I think on one hand significant amount of stress testing that you can imagine goes all the way up to the Board and even our supervisors are interested, but we ourselves as bankers are first and foremost interested in how our books will perform. So, you could imagine there is a significant amount of work in that front in multiple different ways of the imaginable and the unimaginable on one hand. And on the other, there is a very active risk management process that we have lot of experience in and we will continue to be active in.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Monteleone-Barclays</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Thanks. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Eric Aboaf</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Thank you, Brian.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Your next question comes from the line of Rob Nuccio with Income Research. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Rob Nuccio-Income Research</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Hi, thanks for taking my call. And I will just come out and say I will beat the dead horse one more time, but just when you consider your needs of debt issuance and trying to do $1 billion to $1.5 billion to keep things manageable for investors. Has that changed your shift and how much you would ultimately want to issue in U.S. dollars versus other currencies?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Eric Aboaf</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Rob, it\u2019s Eric. No, the discussion of dollar versus non-dollar is really driven by investor appetite on one hand around the world that we find it quite broad-based. We have always been a global issuer. It\u2019s driven by the credit demands, the credit spreads you see in those individual markets, which tends to be a little different. And so we take advantage of that. And then the foreign exchange basis, because we naturally will swap most of the dead back to dollars and insulated for many currency swings. And as the basis moves in favor of one currency or another, we will issue that currency. What we do like to do is to have the diversified set of issuance across multiple currencies, multiple investor groups, multiple geographies, multiple tenors and you will see us continue to do that, because that\u2019s an optimization on one hand for the economics and it gives us a diversification of funding opportunities from a liquidity standpoint on the other.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Rob Nuccio-Income Research</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Okay, great. Thanks. That\u2019s all I had.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Thank you.

Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Ms. Kendall, you may begin.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong><a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/search/transcripts?term=Susan+Kendall&amp;sasource=participant\">Susan Kendall</a></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you, Brent. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Mike Corbat will speak first. Then John Gerspach, our CFO will take you through the earnings presentation, which is available for download on our Web site, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we will be happy to take questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectation, and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results and capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today, and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the risk factor section of our 2014 Form 10-K.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Susan, thank you. Good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported earnings of $4.8 billion for the first quarter of 2015, or $1.52 per share, excluding the impact of CVA and DVA. It was a strong quarter overall, and we accomplished a great deal by executing against our top strategic priorities. We tightly managed our expenses, helping to achieve positive operating leverage in Citicorp, and we're on track to hit our financial targets for the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Citi Holdings was profitable again, earning a $149 million. We also announced the sales of the largest business remaining in holdings, OneMain, as well as our credit cards business in Japan, and our consumer business in Nicaragua. We have now signed deals to divest over $30 billion of the remaining assets in Citi Holdings, which were already reduced 19% over the last four quarters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">After utilizing $3.3 billion of our deferred tax asset during 2014, we utilized another $1.2 billion of DTA during the first quarter. This helped Citi generate $5.3 billion in regulator capital during the quarter, helping increase our common equity Tier 1 ratio to 11% on a fully implemented Basel III basis, and increase our supplementary leverage ratio to 6.4%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">The Fed did not object to our capital plan, so we can now begin meaningful capital return to our shareholders. This reflects the improvements we made in our capital planning process, as we build a safer and stronger institution.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We continued the transformation of our credit cards business, setting us up for growth in the U.S. with the Costco announcement, and solidifying an important global relationship with MasterCard. We've simplified our products, improved our technology, brought in new talent, and have built a solid foundation to invest in.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">While some businesses, such as markets in international consumer faced revenue headwinds, we had solid overall performance from our core business during the quarter. We grew loans and deposits in our core businesses, and gained wallet share among our target clients.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In ICG, our banking business had a very good quarter, led by investment banking in the private bank, and treasury and trade solutions revenues were up as well in constant dollars.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In markets, as we previously disclosed, we saw a slow start to the year in parts of fixed income, including credit, but our rates and currencies franchise continued to see strong client activity, and equities was roughly flat to last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Our U.S. consumer business posted good performance, driven by growth in retail banking, and international consumer revenues were flat, but loans, deposits, and purchase sales all continued to grow, and some of the headwinds in that business should abate as we go through the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">While I'm pleased with our first quarter accomplishments, the environment, both macro-economically and legally remains very challenging. Interest rates remain low, economic growth is uneven, and market sentiment lacks conviction. That highlights the need for us to continue simplifying our company by focusing on our target clients and markets, while driving our finite resources to where they can generate the best risk adjusted returns.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Regarding our capital planning, we're committed to building on our progress to ensure we have a sustainable process that satisfies the expectations we place on our institution; a bank with unique global reach. We recognize the need to keep strengthening the CCAR process, and are continuing to invest in our compliance and regulatory functions. Overall, we expect to reach a headcount of 30,000 people in these functions by year end, and as an example, we're very focused on resolution planning, and have 600 people dedicated to it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We're maintaining discipline across our company, whether it pertains to our balance sheet, risk management, and expenses in light of the environment. I believe we have the right people in the right jobs to meet these challenges and our targets. As you may know, Steven Bird will succeed Manuel Medina-Mora as Head of Global Consumer Bank. Francisco Aristeguieta will follow him as CEO of Asia, and Jane Fraser will replace him as CEO of Latin America, including Mexico. Between them, these three Citi veterans have been in our company for nearly 50 years, and reflect our deep bench talent.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">I also want to acknowledge the contributions of Brian Leach, who is retiring from Citi at the end of the month. He's worked practically non-stop for the firm over the past nine years, and I know we would not be where we are today without him.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">John will now go through the deck, and then we'll be happy to take your questions. John?</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 3, I'd like to highlight a couple of items; CVA/DVA, and a prior period tax change that affect the comparability of our results to last year. Excluding these items, we earned $1.52 per share in the recent quarter, compared to $1.30 in the first quarter of 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">On Slide 4, we show total Citigroup results. In the first quarter, we earned $4.8 billion, generating a return on assets of 105 basis points, and a return on tangible common equity of 11%. Net income grew by over $660 million year-over-year, with about one-third coming from our core improvement in Citicorp, and two-thirds attributable to lower legal and related expenses in Citi Holdings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Revenues declined on a reported basis to $19.8 billion, but increased slightly year-over-year in constant dollars, driven by modest growth in Citicorp. Expenses declined 10% year-over-year, mostly reflecting the lower legal and repositioning charges, as well as a benefit from FX translation. And net credit losses improved, offset by a lower net loan loss reserve release.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In constant dollars, Citigroup end-of-period loans declined 3% year-over-year to $621 billion, as growth in Citicorp was more than offset by the continued wind down of Citi Holdings. Deposits also decreased 3%, driven by Citi Holdings, including the reclassification of $21 billion of Japan retail deposits to held-for-sale in the fourth quarter of last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On Slide 5, we provide more detail on first quarter revenues in constant dollars. Citicorp revenues were up 2% year-over-year, driven by North America retail banking, and continued strength in our institutional banking franchise, partially offset by lower markets revenues. This growth in Citicorp was partially offset by lower revenues in Citi Holdings, mostly reflecting continued asset reductions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On Slide 6, we show more detail on expenses. In total, Citigroup expenses declined 6% year-over-year in constant dollars, driven by a significant decline in legal and related costs in Citi Holdings. Citicorp expenses grew 1% year-over-year as growth related expenses and higher regulatory and compliance costs were partially offset by efficiency savings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On Slide 7, we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Citicorp net income grew 5% year-over-year in the first quarter. As I just described, we generated positive operating leverage in Citicorp, with 2% growth in revenues, and 1% growth in expense in constant dollars, and we achieved an operating efficiency ratio of 54%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to Citi Holdings; we were profitable again this quarter, with nearly $150 million in net income, compared to a loss of roughly $290 million last year, driven mostly by the lower legal and related expenses. Citi Holdings ended the quarter with $122 billion of assets, or 7% of total Citigroup assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On Slide 8, we show results for international consumer banking in constant dollars; revenues were roughly flat year-over-year in the first quarter, reflecting modest volume growth, offset by spread compression, ongoing regulatory headwinds in certain markets, and the impact of prior period asset sales.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In Latin America, we grew revenues in Mexico on higher loan and deposit balances, as well as a rebound in card purchase sales. However, this growth was offset by the impact of prior period divestitures in other markets. In Asia, we saw modest growth in our retail banking franchise, and wealth management revenues were stable year-over-year. However, card revenues declined as higher volumes were more than offset by lower spreads. In total, average loans grew 3% from last year. Card purchase sales grew 7%, and average deposits grew 5%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Operating expenses grew 2%, as the impact of volume growth and higher regulatory and compliance costs were mostly offset by ongoing efficiency savings. Credit costs declined from last year, driven by a modest net reserve release.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Slide 9, shows the results for North America Consumer Banking. Net income grew 12% year-over-year, on higher revenues, lower operating expenses, and a continued decline in net credit losses, partially offset by a lower net reserve release, and the impact of a tax benefit in the prior year period. Pretax earnings grew 21% from last year. Total revenues were up 4%. Retail banking revenues of $1.3 billion grew 18% from last year, reflecting continued loan and deposit growth, higher mortgage origination activity, and improved deposit spreads.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">This quarter's results include a gain of roughly $110 million on the sale of our Texas branches, as compared to a gain of $70 million last year, on a sale/leaseback transaction. Branded Cards revenues of $2 billion were down slightly from last year as growth in purchase sales and improved spreads were more than offset by the impact of lower average loans, mostly driven by the runoff of promotional rate balances, and higher payment rates. Retail Service revenues grew slightly from last year on higher average loans, and improved spreads, partially offset by contractual partner payments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Total expenses declined 6%, driven by ongoing efficiency savings, as well as lower legal and repositioning costs. We continue to resize our North America retail banking business in the first quarter, while also growing our average deposits, loans, and assets under management. Since the beginning of 2014, we have sold or closed nearly 200 branches in North America. We are focused on deepening relationships with our target clients in urban areas.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Today, roughly 90% of our footprint is concentrated around seven key markets. While average deposits grew 1% year-over-year in the first quarter, checking account balances grew 10%, and assets under management grew 7%. Today, our average deposit balance per branch is roughly $218 million, up over 20% from a year ago.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Slide 10 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail. Overall, credit remained favourable in the first quarter. In North America and Asia, trends remained stable to improving; and in Latin America, the NCL rate increased somewhat from last quarter on a normalized basis, however, the delinquency rate continue to improve, which we expect to result in lower NCL rates later in the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Slide 11 shows the expense trends for global consumer banking. Over the last 12 months, our consumer efficiency ratio was 55%, including over 200 basis points attributable to legal and repositioning charges. In the first quarter, these charges were minimal, and the total efficiency ratio for global consumer banking was 52.6%, down from nearly 55% in the first quarter of last year. We currently expect to improve the total consumer efficiency ratio to 52% or below for the full year of 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning now to the institutional clients group on Slide 12; revenues of $9.1 billion in the first quarter were down slightly from last year and up 27% sequentially. Total banking revenues of $4.2 billion grew 4% from last year, and 3% from the prior quarter. Treasury and trade solution revenues of $1.9 billion were down 2% versus prior period on a reported basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In constant dollars, TTS revenues grew 4% from last year, as growth in deposit balances and spreads more than offset a decline in trade revenues. Investment banking revenues of $1.2 billion were up 14% from last year, and 12% sequentially, driven by strong M&amp;A and debt underwriting activity partially offset by lower equity underwriting revenues.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Private bank revenues of $708 million grew 6% year-over-year, driven by higher client volumes and growth in capital markets products, and corporate lending revenues were $445 million, up 7% from last year on higher average loans and improved fair value marks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Total markets and security services revenues of $4.8 billion declined 6% year-over-year and grew 62% sequentially. Fixed income revenues of $3.5 billion were down 11% from last year, primarily driven by spread products partially offset by growth in rates and currencies.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As we previously disclosed, we saw a slow start in spread products this year as compared to a strong first quarter last year, with lower activity levels across distressed credit, non-investment grades CLOs, and municipals. We did see strong client activity in investment grade credit; however, these flows tend to come at lower spreads.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to rates and currencies, client flows were very strong this quarter in both G10 and local markets, driven in part by Central Bank actions and a pickup in FX volatility. Excluding the modest loss we incurred on the Swiss franc revaluation, rates and currencies revenues would have improved by greater than 20% from last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Equities revenues of $873 million declined 1% year-over-year, as growth in prime finance was offset by lower cash equity revenues. Sequentially, revenues grew 86% on seasonally higher activity and improved trading performance in EMEA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">In security services, revenues were up 12% year-over-year and 7% sequentially, reflecting increased activity and higher client balances. Total operating expenses of $4.6 billion declined 5%, driven by FX translations, lower legal and repositioning expenses, and ongoing efficiency savings, partially offset by higher regulatory and compliance costs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On Slide 13, we show expense and efficiency trends for the institutional business. Over the last 12 months, our efficiency ratio was 57%, including roughly a 140 basis points attributable to legal and repositioning charges; and our comp ratio was 28%. Currently expect to achieve a total ICG efficiency ratio closer to the midpoint of the 53% to 57% target range for the full year 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Slide 14 shows the results for corporate other. Revenues were down slightly year-over-year, while total operating expenses increased, driven by higher legal and repositioning charges. On a sequential basis, revenues improved, driven by hedging activities as well as the absence of losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities. And expenses were down as more regulatory and compliance costs were absorbed directly by the businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Slide 15 shows Citi Holdings' assets, which totaled $122 billion at quarter end, including $31 billion of assets, which had been reported in Citicorp until this quarter. Over the past few months we've made great progress in divesting these and other assets in Citi Holdings, including the announced sales of our consumer businesses in Japan, Peru, and Nicaragua, as well as OneMain Financial. We expect these sales to close this year, totaling roughly $32 billion of assets, and we have several other active sales processes underway.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On Slide 16, we show Citi Holdings' financial results for the quarter. A significant reduction in legal and related expenses drove most of the earnings improvement year-over-year. Total revenues of $1.8 billion were down 7%, while core operating expenses fell by 13%, reflecting the continued wind down of the portfolio. And credit cards improved as lower net credit losses were partially offset by a lower net reserve release.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On Slide 17, we show Citigroup's net interest revenue and margin trends. The bars represent net interest revenue per day for each quarter in constant dollars, showing a consistent growth trend year-over-year even as the contribution from Citi Holdings has begun to shrink.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Our net interest margin remained flat sequentially at 292 basis points in the first quarter, and was up slightly from a year ago on improved funding costs. In the second quarter, we expect our net interest margin to decline perhaps by two to three basis points similar to the trend we've seen in prior years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Looking to the second half of the year, our results will depend in part on the timing of divestitures, including OneMain and our Japanese retail business. We estimate that without these businesses on a combined basis, our net interest margin would be lower by roughly seven to eight basis points before using any part of the associated gains to redeem high cost debt.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On Slide 18, we show our key capital metrics on a fully implemented Basel III basis. During the quarter, our CET 1 capital ratio improved to 11%, driven by retained earnings, and approximately $1.2 billion of DTA utilization. Our supplementary leverage ratio improved to 6.4%, and our tangible book value grew to $57.66 per share.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">In summary, we delivered solid results in the first quarter with modest revenue growth and positive operating leverage in Citicorp, significantly lowered legal and repositioning expenses and continued favorable credit trends. We continue to wind down Citi Holdings in an economically rational manner including several announced divestitures that we expect to close by year end. And we also strengthened our capital position, ending the quarter with a CET 1 ratio of 11%, and a supplementary leverage ratio of 6.4%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On a full year basis, we remain committed to delivering our financial targets, including a Citicorp efficiency ratio in the mid-50s, and as Citigroup return on assets of at least 90 basis points.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">In Citicorp, we continue to expect modest revenue growth in 2015. In consumer, we saw healthy growth in North America retail banking this quarter, as volumes continued to grow and deposit spreads improved. However, international consumer revenues were flat year-over-year. This trend should improve somewhat as we progress through the year, driven by continued volume growth, as we expect the pace of regulatory change and spread headwinds to abate in certain markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Turning to our institutional franchise, we saw good momentum this quarter across corporate lending, investment banking, treasury and trade solutions, security services and the private bank. Together, these businesses represent over half of our institutional revenues, and should continue to grow this year with some quarterly fluctuations. And in markets, we expect our performance in 2015 to reflect the overall environment with a goal of continuing to gain wallet share with our target clients.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">In Citi Holdings, we remain focused on winding down the portfolio, while staying above breakeven on a full year basis. Overall, we continue to expect credit cards to increase in 2015, driven by loan growth as well as lower loan loss reserve releases. And we expect to keep balance sheet discipline, staying at or below our current size.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Our first quarter results provide a solid start to 2015, better demonstrating our underlying earnings power and the impact of the actions we've taken to simplify and streamline our operations.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">And with that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p6\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Hi, good morning, John. I had a question on the expenses. In terms of the core expenses, trying to get a sense of how much of your cost saves you achieved this quarter are reflected in the core operating expense, somewhere at the $10.8 billion? Or I guess another way of asking, is that number sustainable and a good jumping-off point for expenses from here?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Yes, John, as we ended the fourth quarter of 2014, I think what we told you then is that all the repositioning actions that we had taken during the previous nine quarters we expected to generate cost savings, annual cost savings of about $3.4 billion. And as of the fourth quarter of last year, about $2.7 billion of those cost saves were already embedded in our expense base. That left about $700 billion of annual saves to realize then during 2015. And in the first quarter we generated an additional -- just over $200 million of that remaining $700 million. So we've got some more to go this year, but we feel pretty good about the level of expenses that we're currently running at.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay. And is the first quarter typically high on expenses because of the seasonality of the investment bank revenues?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">No, we don't -- I wouldn't say it's typically higher in the first quarter, it's a little bit higher maybe in the first quarter, but pretty much, expenses stay fairly consistent during the course of the year, again depending on certain fluctuations or episodic items. You saw at the end of last year we had some expense growth associated with our focus on CCAR. So those items do give us some quarterly fluctuations, but again, I think the first quarter is a pretty good jumping-off point for the rest of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay. And then, could you also just clarify the comments about the NIM, and then interest margin in the second half of the year, John. You're selling some businesses now have an impact on NIM, but it sounded like there might be some actions you could take to mitigate that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Yes, well, John, what we said even in the earnings release that -- not in the earnings release, even in the press release that we put out in connection with signing the deal for OneMain Financial is that our intent is to invest some of the gains that we get from that sale to redeem high cost debt that are used to fund the businesses. Redeeming that, that high cost debt will then serve to improve the NIM, somewhat mitigate the impact of the NIM loss from OneMain.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. And just on a related point to that, John, I was hoping I could ask Mike a question in terms of the CCAR. Mike, you passed the CCAR, I presume you've heard back from regulators in terms of how you did, and maybe new MRA. Could you share any thoughts on what kind of feedback you received and what you'd work on for next submission? And then related to OneMain, is it too early to ask if the OneMain transaction goes through as planned, would you consider maybe making an off cycle request to add on to your existing approval, with an update for capital that might get released when OneMain goes away?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>A - <a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/search/transcripts?term=Mike+Corbat&amp;sasource=participant\">Mike Corbat</a></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Sure, John. Starting with CCAR, I think it was -- first off, I should preface it by saying that not only we believe the industry or the submitting banks haven't yet received formal response in terms of feedback, and so we've gotten verbal response, but I would categorize the responses we've received so far as having put a lot of work into it, made a tremendous amount of progress, but on an industry basis the large SIFI banks have more work to do. We've recognized we have more work to do, and we view 2015 as an important year to do that. And Barbara Besoer, and the team are obviously committed to doing that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">From a OneMain perspective, it's early in the year. I would say, we're not big fans of going through the processes of one-offs, but let's get through the year and see how things go, and we'll make a decision at some point later in the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. And the timing, expected timing, just as an update on OneMain?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>A - <a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/search/transcripts?term=Mike+Corbat&amp;sasource=participant\">Mike Corbat</a></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Second quarter -- I'm sorry, third quarter, John.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Hey, good morning guys.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>A - <a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/search/transcripts?term=John+Gerspach&amp;sasource=participant\">John Gerspach</a></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Good morning, Jim.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Maybe just a question on the big jump in the SLR, that seems to imply, if my math is right, that you made some progress on the denominator. I guess, first, is that the case? And does that have also positive implications for the Tier 1 leverage in CCAR when we think about next year, or is that just purely an SLR phenomenon?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>A - <a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/search/transcripts?term=John+Gerspach&amp;sasource=participant\">John Gerspach</a></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">No, it's primarily focused on SLR, and we did make progress in reducing the denominator of SLR, that will have knock-on effects against other ratios. And again, it's just something that we are focused on. It's against all categories of the various SLR computation. And so it does have knock-on effects for other calculations.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Do you think there's more to go there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>A - <a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/search/transcripts?term=John+Gerspach&amp;sasource=participant\">John Gerspach</a></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Well, we're always looking to optimize. I feel pretty good about where we are right now, at 6.4%, but we'll always strive to run the most efficient balance sheet that we can.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Yep. Fair enough. Maybe just a follow-up question on fixed income; you guys, and I think some others have mentioned a slow start, particularly in spread products. Maybe if you can give us a sense, you've disclosed the [indiscernible] rates and effects as a bigger proportion of your business, and some others you had a competitor today show significant, or decent year-over-year growth in FIC despite arguably a lower concentration in FX and rates and a similar decline in spread products. So I'm just trying to get a sense, was it really the issue with the Swiss franc, or just had a particularly bad, tough time in spread products; just trying to get a sense why we wouldn't have seen a little bit more of a improved result there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>A - <a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/search/transcripts?term=John+Gerspach&amp;sasource=participant\">John Gerspach</a></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yes, well, Jim, as you know, I mean when you're trying to do growth rates, or you're trying to do anything year-on-year, you have to look at the composition of both periods.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Sure</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>A - <a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/search/transcripts?term=John+Gerspach&amp;sasource=participant\">John Gerspach</a></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And so, if you go back to the first quarter of '14 that was on a relative basis compared to our peers, a very strong quarter for our FIC businesses. It was especially strong for us in spread products. The first quarter of '14 gives us a tough comp. Spread products, historically, have accounted for about 40% of our FIC revenues, but if I look back to the first quarter of '14, spread product revenues was significantly above that level.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Then, if look at the current quarter, year-over-year, our spread products' revenues are down significantly. They're down significantly to the point where the revenues per spread products this year are below the historical percentage that we would normally expect them to be of our total FIC business. So it's been a significant impact on us. And I mentioned some of the underlying factors during the prepared comments; lower activity levels across the distressed credit, as well as non-investment grade CLOs, and munis [ph]. So these are what I would call, \"Normal fluctuations,\" that you would expect in an uncertain rate environment, and just reflective of the lack of distressed opportunities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Rates and currencies, just to segue over, rates and currencies benefited from extremely strong customer flows throughout the quarter, especially in our FX business. And that's why we said that, excluding the reval impact that we had, the modest loss stemming from the Swiss franc, rates and currencies revenues would have been up over 20% compared to the first quarter of '14. So I characterize the first quarter of '15 as a strong quarter for rates and currencies -- our rates and currencies franchise, but a down quarter for spread products. It's exacerbated by a tough comp backed [ph] to an extremely strong 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">That's all fair. I appreciate the color. Just any more color on how things progress throughout the quarter. You mentioned as slow start, does that imply that things got better each month, progressive month?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>A - <a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/search/transcripts?term=John+Gerspach&amp;sasource=participant\">John Gerspach</a></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">It was a slow start and things evened out during the course of the quarter, but I wouldn't say that we finished with a big upswing in spread products.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay, thanks. Thanks for all the color.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>A - <a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/search/transcripts?term=John+Gerspach&amp;sasource=participant\">John Gerspach</a></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question comes from the line of <a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/search/transcripts?term=Matt+O\">Matt O'Connor</a> with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>A - <a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/search/transcripts?term=John+Gerspach&amp;sasource=participant\">John Gerspach</a></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hi, Matt.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>A - <a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/search/transcripts?term=Mike+Corbat&amp;sasource=participant\">Mike Corbat</a></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Just from a consolidated point of view, if we look at net interest income, it was down about $500 million versus last quarter, is that mostly the impact of FX and day count?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>A - <a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/search/transcripts?term=John+Gerspach&amp;sasource=participant\">John Gerspach</a></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Matt, I missed you. I'm sorry, there was -- what was down, 500 million; I'm sorry?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Sure. If you look at consolidated net interest income dollars, they were down about 500 million Q-Q?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>A - <a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/search/transcripts?term=John+Gerspach&amp;sasource=participant\">John Gerspach</a></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Q-on-Q, well, don't forget there is a two-day impact. The fourth quarter has got 92 days in it; the first quarter has 90 days.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Right, and I assume some FX impact in there as well or\u2026</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>A - <a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/search/transcripts?term=John+Gerspach&amp;sasource=participant\">John Gerspach</a></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">There's going to be some impact on that as well. You can see the -- on a constant dollar basis, you can see the comparison in net interest revenue per day on slide 17, and as you can see on a per day basis, fourth quarter on constant dollars, first quarter net interest revenue is spot on with the net interest revenue that we had in the fourth quarter of last year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay then in terms of the outlook, I mean, you gave me some color on the NIM down a couple of bits potentially in 2Q, but we should pick up a day, and then some balance sheet growth, so those net II dollars should be up, I guess, as we think about 1Q to 2Q?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>A - <a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/search/transcripts?term=John+Gerspach&amp;sasource=participant\">John Gerspach</a></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I hate to get that deep into it, Matt. The expectation is that NIM is going to be down, as it has been every second quarter for the last couple of years, down two to three basis points. There's a certain amount of seasonality in that. You can see though, again, if you look back, as far as our net interest revenue per day, it stays pretty constant. So that's more of a denominator factor than anything else.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. And then maybe a bigger-picture question on Mexico. I know, it was a couple of years ago, there had been some de- risking there in terms of the credit profile. And then more recently, some control issues had been flagged. Just where are we, and, obviously, there's that change of management as well. How are you feeling on Mexico overall in terms of, both the new leadership that you have there, and as well as the strategy from the fundamentals?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>A - <a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/search/transcripts?term=John+Gerspach&amp;sasource=participant\">John Gerspach</a></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Matt, I would say we feel quite good. As you referenced, we made some material changes to management leadership in Mexico, both from an operations and from a control perspective and feel like we've got the right people in place. We did fairly broad-sweeping reviews of our control processes in Mexico. And as we've said, as a company, we are extremely bullish on the economic prospects of Mexico, and Banamex's position in terms of helping to fuel that growth for the country. We see a lot of opportunity in Mexico.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay, just lastly if I can squeeze in. I assume you can't tell us anything more on the Costco deal than what's out there, but anything on the timing in terms of when you'll have more details to share?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>A - <a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/search/transcripts?term=John+Gerspach&amp;sasource=participant\">John Gerspach</a></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">No, Matt. That will happen during the ensuing couple of quarters and we'll put those details out when they are available.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay, all right, thanks for taking the questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>A - <a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/search/transcripts?term=John+Gerspach&amp;sasource=participant\">John Gerspach</a></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">All right, thanks, Matt.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question comes from the line of <a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/search/transcripts?term=Glenn+Schorr&amp;sasource=participant\">Glenn Schorr</a> with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Hello there, thanks. So I liked the improvement on the efficiency ratio targets, and liked the commitment to the target ranges. Just a quick, curious question on -- I don't think of you as the biggest rate beneficiary, but it helps, but what type of rate scenario do you have embedded in there, or I like your tone from last quarter of, we're going to hit them, one way or another.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>A - <a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/search/transcripts?term=John+Gerspach&amp;sasource=participant\">John Gerspach</a></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yes. You know Matt, as we -- not Matt, Glenn; sorry. You just overwhelmed me with what you liked, and I was focusing on that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">We'll get to the [indiscernible].</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>A - <a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/search/transcripts?term=John+Gerspach&amp;sasource=participant\">John Gerspach</a></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yes, yes, yes. Look, as going into the year, what we said was that we were expecting a continuation of the difficult environment that we experienced in 2014, and unfortunately, I think that's where we're heading into; certainly that's the way 2015 is playing out. We weren't expecting to be bailed out by any sort of significant rate increase, and again it doesn't look like that's going to happen. So we said that we thought that our Citi core businesses could generate low-to-mid single-digit revenue growth this year just based upon the fundamentals, and that is, in effect, what we experienced in the first quarter, with a 2% growth rate in Citicorp.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So we don't really have any sort of significant rate increase baked into those revenue projections. And our commitment is to deliver Citicorp that mid-50s efficiency ratio, and then the ROA target for overall Citigroup, no matter what the environment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Very much appreciate that. A strong dollar didn't seem to have a huge P&amp;L impact, and broke all out -- you broke out for us all the places that hit both revenue and expenses. It also impacts the G-SIB buffer, and I know those rules aren't finalized, but is there a way to hedge that, or do you give up P&amp;L neutrality if you wind up hedging that as an either/or scenario?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>A - <a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/search/transcripts?term=John+Gerspach&amp;sasource=participant\">John Gerspach</a></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">One, I wouldn't even propose putting on hedges for rules that are not even fully baked in yet, so\u2026</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>A - <a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/search/transcripts?term=John+Gerspach&amp;sasource=participant\">John Gerspach</a></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">That's not something we're looking at. The difficulty with anything to do with the G-SIB calculation is that, not only is it linked to changes in the FX rate, it's linked to what 79 other banks are doing, and I don't know how to put a hedge on against 79 banks' activities. That's just not something that I know how to control at this point in time. From an overall, what we can focus on, what we do know what to do, is hedge the CET 1 ratio, and you can see, again, that despite all their fluctuations in the dollar, it had zero impact on our CET 1 ratio. We laid that out for you in Slide 37 in the back of the deck.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So we've got a very effective ratio hedging program on to protect the capital ratios that are significant. And you can see that once again, as you said, the dollar fluctuation doesn't really impact our revenue or -- well, it doesn't impact on net income performance. Again, we laid that out for you in the back of the deck as well. Whether the dollar is going up or the dollar is going down, it all nets out to somewhere of plus or minus $100 million dollars of pre-tax earnings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes, I appreciate that. Last one, on credit, which has also been great. I'm just curious if there's anything within, whether it would be Russia/Ukraine exposure, or energy exposure that is getting internal rankings going higher, or should I say internal downgrades that we should be thinking about throughout this year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>A - <a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/search/transcripts?term=John+Gerspach&amp;sasource=participant\">John Gerspach</a></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We've been actively managing the exposure, obviously, to Russia on an ongoing basis and -- excuse me I apologize. As you can -- As you have seen, we've continued to manage down the exposure that we have in Russia. The consumer business in Russia is actually performing, I'd say, better than what we had expected; so that's good. When it comes to energy-related matters, we gave you a lot of details as far as our energy exposures when we did fourth quarter last year. Well, we'll give you more details on that when we do the Fixed Income Investor Presentation next week, but in general, our energy-related exposures on a funded basis are steady, fourth quarter to first quarter. Total exposure is down slightly. We mentioned last quarter that about 85% of our exposure energy companies was investment grade. We had some minor downgrades in that, but I think it's reduced by a couple of 300 basis points, or maybe it's down to 82%, so it's still very strong.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">During the quarter though, in connection with those downgrades, we did take about a $100 million reserve, no credit loses, but we did take a $100 million credit reserve and that you'll see reflected in the ICG results this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Great I appreciate all that, thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>A - <a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/search/transcripts?term=John+Gerspach&amp;sasource=participant\">John Gerspach</a></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Not a problem, Glenn.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your nest question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Good morning, guys. On holdings, thinking about the $30 billion in sales that you've inked, or equivalent of $30 billion in assets tied to sales that you've already inked, how should we think about revenues and expenses that are tied to those?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Well, when you take a look at holdings, we -- again, our commitment to holdings is to be able to run that business at least on a breakeven basis over a full year period, and we believe that even with the sales that we've got lined up for the balance of this year, we still should be able to produce holdings at breakeven during the balance of this year and into next year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay, all right. Thanks for that, John. And then, how about on the capital front, can you help us think about what potential capital impact might come from those deals?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Well, we don't go into deal-by-deal basis on these things. Holdings, at the end of the first quarter has got about a $179 billion worth of risk weighted assets, now about $49 billion of those assets though are op risk assets, so individual sales are not going to impact op risks. So, say, you've got a $130 billion dollars of mostly credit risk, some market risk, but mostly credit risk, risk weighted assets sitting there in Citi Holdings, and if you think about the businesses that we've got on tab, including OneMain and Japan, they total as we said about $32 billion worth of GAAP assets, but on a risk weighted asset basis, it's much lower than that. They only account for about $16 billion worth of the risk weighted assets, and that's just because of the concentration of HQLA [ph] type assets that are concentrated in Japan.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So you are not going to get a significant drop-off in holdings risk weighted assets just stemming from the combination of those deals.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">That's helpful. And then, you mentioned, John, I believe a decline in trade revenues, we heard -- a competitor mentioned lower demand in trade finance, could you give maybe a little bit of colour around that business and what trends you are seeing there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes, I'd say that our commentary would be similar. There certainly is a lower demand. Some of the trade finance businesses obviously is in connection with energy-related type of projects. So when you get the price of oil dropping by 50%, you are going to have a significant drop in your demand for trade finance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Importantly, what we're evidencing in that business is a discipline, we are not just going to chase volume at any cost, because chasing volume just doesn't give you the type of returns that you want. So we are maintaining good relationships with our clients, but shifting the business to, some to be -- we'll facilitate the deal, but not look to hold the asset itself, and so that has a reduction in our trade revenues for now, but we are maintaining we think overall market share in the trade finance area.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay, that's helpful. Last one from me, Argentina, we've seen a lot of noise coming out of the situation there with the bond payments and the like, is that just how you think about that market from here?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>A - <a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/search/transcripts?term=Mike+Corbat&amp;sasource=participant\">Mike Corbat</a></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">If you look at our franchise in Argentina, we just in actually 2014 celebrated our 100th anniversary of being in the country and it's a place that we've got a history franchise. Clearly, we're challenged that today, or if you go back to March 12, sitting between the district court ruling here in the U.S. and the Argentine government is not a place we want to be. And as a result of finding ourselves in that position, made the decision on our own that we would like to exit the custody business. And so, we are in conversations with the Argentine government in terms of trying to execute against that process. Many of these things are complicated, but we think that's the best course of action for us to take.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And limit it to the custody business at this stage?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>A - <a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/search/transcripts?term=Mike+Corbat&amp;sasource=participant\">Mike Corbat</a></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Absolutely. Limited to the custody business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Terrific. Thanks for all the color.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>A - <a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/search/transcripts?term=Mike+Corbat&amp;sasource=participant\">Mike Corbat</a></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes, no problem.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Hey, thanks. One follow-up and one on expenses; just on the RWA discussion around Citi Holdings so to get RWAs down more significantly from here is that just a function of the U.S. first and second-lien resi portfolio fading, is that necessarily [ph] the next driver, or is it some of these others that are on tap to be sold?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I'd say still the U.S. mortgage portfolio in Citi Holdings, you can see that it's got the lion share of the GAAP assets, and in similar fashion, it has the lion share of the remaining risk weighted assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes, and that's a natural state over four years, is that how we should think about it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Well, we've done there some opportunistic asset sales. We continue to run that portfolio down. You've seen the reduction that we achieved in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. So that's a combination, both of pay downs as well as asset sales, and we will continue to do that where the economics makes sense.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Sure, okay. And then, separately on the expenses which I would say looks fantastic this quarter, you indicated earlier that there's about [ph] $700 million left in the cost saves to come through, $200 -- well, I should say $500 million left, 700 beginning of the year, 200 used this quarter, 500 left to go; is that going to manifest itself mostly through non-comp lines as it comes through. I'm just thinking about it relative to the comments you made on ICG group, with the expense target going from 57 to 55, and a comp ratio of 28 looks extremely efficient already on the comp line?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes, the bulk of the remaining annualized savings, and I want to just be clear, Betsy, that roughly 500, little bit less than 500 -- that's on an annualized basis. So you'll get that in the expense based during the remaining three quarters, but that will show itself. But the bulk of those savings are split between comp costs as well as real estate costs, because we got real estate actions that we've also got embedded as we continue to take streamlining actions. We're consolidating sites along with some of the personnel actions that we've taken. So you'll see it on both the occupancy line as well as on the compensation lines.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. And then just lastly on the repo costs, you've mentioned for couple of quarters here that you would expect repo activities would be -- repositioning activities would be fading. We had a smaller run rate this quarter, obviously repo costs, is that the kind of expectation going forward here, or are we just taking a pause before you dig into the next round?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Our overall guidance has been that we expect legal and repositioning costs to run about 200 basis points with Citicorp. And we said that was a pretty good target to go forward for 2015. So when you look at the overall level of legal and repositioning in the quarter, I think it ran something like a 175 basis points. So roughly in line with that 200 basis point target. Well, I think that during the course of the year, you will continue to see some level of repositioning; even in this quarter, while Citicorp I think shows a repositioning charge of one, there was actually gross repositioning charges of something around $30 million, but that was largely offset by the release of some previously established repositioning reserves from prior periods. But we still will continue to do some repositioning. But yes, we do think that the bulk -- certainly the largest portion of our repositioning efforts are behind us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And the 500 million is coming through roughly evenly spread next three quarters, or is it backend loaded all?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I'd say that we got a little over 200 million in the first quarter. There's probably a little bit more to come that will be -- you'll see in the third quarter with the second and fourth quarter somewhat evenly split.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Very well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Hi, I'm trying to reconcile two thoughts; the positive thought comes from the CEO letter, where Mike you say, all that we accomplished over the last two years has been in preparation for this year. That's a pretty positive statement, but then I've heard a few I think negative statements on the call; the ICG efficiency ratio was 51% in the first quarter, and you're guiding the 55% for the year. So I guess that won't maintain. Trading typically peaks in the first quarter. You talked about a lower margin after the asset sale, so is this as good as it gets, or is this a false start for Citigroup, or is there a lot more ahead?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>A - <a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/search/transcripts?term=Mike+Corbat&amp;sasource=participant\">Mike Corbat</a></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Well, Mike, I would say that you're right, there is cyclicality to the business, but if you look at the quarter I think there's a couple of stories or a couple of themes in here that are important to call out. John talked about the diversification of our earnings base, and if you look at the banking piece of it, we had good earnings growth in banking at the same time offsetting some softness around parts of our markets business, if you look at what's going on in terms of North American consumer.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So we believe, and you look at the earnings power of Citi, and how and where we make it, depends upon certain revenue streams. Hopefully you see and believe that there's more diversity to what we're doing. And I think a lot of that's the work that we've done and continue to do.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">From an overall efficiency perspective, and from an ICG perspective, we are committed to our targets. And yes, ICG did have an efficiency ratio of in the low 50s, but again we've got investments that we need to make in that business, and we can't be starving these businesses, and we're already -- when you compare us against our industry peers, we're already leading in terms of what we're doing. And by the way, when we talk of an efficiency ratio of 54% for the quarter in Citicorp, when you take that and overlay it over Citigroup, it goes to 55%. So it's not that there's a bunch of things that are away from that. So, completely committed to the targets, diversification of earnings, and I think a continued story going forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Mike, let me just -- the other things, I just want to make sure that you picked up on some of the other things we've talked about, which is that, we did recognize that we had headwinds in our international consumer business during this first quarter as well. So in a quarter where we had headwinds in both our trading performance as well as in international consumer, we still are able to post overall strong results.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And as Mike said, I think that really speaks to the balance and strength of the overall business model. And we fully expect international consumer to generate growth in the second half of the year and return to positive operating leverage. So I just want to make sure that you captured all the positive statements.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Got it, that addresses the operating efficiency. On capital efficiency, Mike, you said that you don't really believe in a lot of one-off to buyback capital, but you can now repurchase stock, which is different; actually if you could let us know when you're allowed to start buying back stock, and also if you can buyback stock at such a discount to tangible book value, why wouldn't you sell off additional non-core assets? I mean if it was me I could -- if I could buy dollar bills for a discount, I'd be buying as many as I could. I mean I'm looking at my office, I'd be selling my water bottle, my stapler, you know, maybe my desk chair, I'd stand -- I'd do whatever I could to raise that additional capital buyback stock and I'd make the request to regulators. And the question before, why not take the proceeds from OneMain or anything else that you can sell for a gain and buyback stock right now?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>A - <a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/search/transcripts?term=Mike+Corbat&amp;sasource=participant\">Mike Corbat</a></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Well, two things. One is we have started buying back stocks. Our permission gave us the ability to start that on April 1, and we did. So that's underway. And I think if you've seen, Mike, we've been very disciplined, and I think quite transparent in terms of the way we look at our businesses. And those businesses that over the intermediate term, we don't believe there's a pathway to be accretive to our franchise in the industry. You've seen us take action against those. And so we'll continue to review those, but we believe today that franchise away from holdings has largely positioned the way we'd like it to be. And if you look at the returns of those businesses, both institutional and consumer, they're accretive to our shareholders.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">All right, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>A - <a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/search/transcripts?term=Mike+Corbat&amp;sasource=participant\">Mike Corbat</a></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">All right.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question comes from the line of <a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/search/transcripts?term=Steven+Chubak&amp;sasource=participant\">Steven Chubak</a> with Nomura. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Q - <a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/search/transcripts?term=Steven+Chubak&amp;sasource=participant\">Steven Chubak</a></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Hi, good morning. So John, I just wanted to start off with maybe a follow-up to Glenn's earlier question on the G-SIB surcharge [ph] calculation. Recognizing, of course, as you said the Fed's proposal has not been finalized, assuming the current draft and some of those FX considerations relating to the calculation, or [ph] not amended, can you maybe just speak to some of the actions that you can take to help mitigate the G-SIB score. And in addition to that, whether you have any plans to actually manage to a specific target and say, \"No,\" it's unclear whether you've moved up a bucket from the 3.5% to the 4%?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Thanks, Steve. I'd say it's pretty clear that we have moved up to afford it to the 4% bucket. I mean that's certainly our estimation, just given -- again, given the change in exchange rates and everything else we'll get confirmation of that, but we're pretty sure that we're in that 4% bucket under the current proposed rules. And we'll have to see how those play out.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And as we've said, you saw some of the impact that we've had by managing down some of the components of the SLR denominator. And so, again, we're looking to manage down various elements of both the SLR and the G-SIB calculation. We focus on the OTC -- derivatives that are trading on OTC, the PFE associated with derivatives; things that we can control, we're bringing down. We haven't seen the disclosure yet, but we brought our derivative notional down another $3 billion or so in the quarter, $3 trillion, sorry. And so where we can, we will. What I don't know is what impact that has on the calculation, because I don't know what everybody else is doing. And I don't know where FX rates are going. So we will look to optimize our footprint, but the way the calculation is currently structured, I can't tell you that it will have any impact.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Have you had any dialog with regulators with regards to the approach, and whether -- it seems fairer balance giving some of those FX considerations as well as the fact that it's a relative calculation as you noticed?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I believe that there were a series of comment letters already submitted to the Fed, and I'm sure that the Fed is giving those due consideration.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Understood; and maybe just one more on risk weighted assets, also follow-up to Betsy's question with regards to Holdings' RWA specifically; just looking at some of the 10-K disclosure that you guys provided, it looks like 30% of Holdings' RWA consists of operational risks, so call it $54 billion or so. And just given the long look back for op risk, I just want to get a better understanding as to what happens in an accelerated unwind of Holding? Should we expect that 5 to 6 billion of capital is actually released, or does it persist or linger because of the significant look back?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Steven, so the updated number that I mentioned earlier is we would say that of the $179 billion at the end of the first quarter of risk weighted assets that's in Holdings, that $49 billion of that is op risk. And right on to your point, we don't expect that op risk RWA to dissipate just because we've gotten rid of the Holdings' assets. That will stay with us for sometime. I can't tell you how long, but it will be with us for sometime.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay, that's really helpful. Thanks, John, and congratulations on a strong quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Thank you, Steven.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Thank you. Good afternoon, guys.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yes, good afternoon.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">John, you mentioned that your deposits per branch here in the States I think were up 20% even though you've obviously downsized the branch structure that you have here in the States. Are you now at the optimal level in the seven cities that you've identified, or is there further reductions that we should expect?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Well, we're concentrated around those seven cities. Are there still some branches outside those seven cities that we might consider doing some further pruning on? Perhaps, and there's probably other opportunities that we have to open up additional outlets in some of those seven cities as well. So the number 788 that we currently have, that could go up a little, could go down a little, I wouldn't necessarily just focus on it, but again whatever we do, we will be consistent with that strategy of concentrating our efforts on those seven urban areas.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Following up on your comments that you talked about with after OneMain is sold, obviously the NIM will come under some pressure, but you do get the capital gain hopefully from the sale, and you can pay down some of your high cost debt. Will some of the gain be also used for stock repurchases, or is it all just to reduce that higher cost debt?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Under the CCAR, the thing that -- the CCAR submittal, we've already received approval over the next five quarters to buyback about $7.8 billion of our stock. And so, those actions are currently underway, as Mike indicated earlier, beginning on April 1 as to whether or not we would do anything specific with the OneMain gain, while it's probably too early to give you a definitive answer, I would not expect us to.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. Early in your comments, I think you guys said that by the end of the year, you might have about 30,000 folks working in regulatory and compliance. Where's that number today?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I think at the start of the year, we were looking at something around 26,000, may be a little bit over that. So I think in terms of slightly more than 10%-12% growth during the course of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And do you guys have a ballpark and what that cost is, if you use an average salary of 60,000 or something like that for the folks that are in that division or that group?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I'm not going to address the 60,000 number that you just drew out, but now I can't give you a specific cost of that. We've made comments that obviously the cost associated with regulatory and compliance efforts has continued to increase. It's consumed a fairly significant portion of the efficiency savings that we've been generating in the business. We've given you that math before. We've said that, of the $3.4 billion of expense saves that we expect to get in specifically of the now $2.9 billion of expense saves that we've gotten through our efficiency efforts, approximately 50% of those savings are being consumed by additional investments that we're making in regulatory and compliance activities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay, thanks. And obviously, General Electric made that announcement about exiting the financial services business in a big way by selling couple of hundred billion of assets; is any interest on your guys' part and looking at any of those portfolios?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I think as we've shown, Gerard, we're always willing and interested to look at assets at the right price, so, if things fit in strategy, happy to look at it, but I don't see us breaking into new areas that we're not already in.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Great. And then just finally, coming back to -- John, I heard your comments about the G-SIB NPR, and obviously everybody has made their comments and letters. To your recollection in the past on NPRs, does the Fed ever come back to you guys, you and your peers for added commentary after the official closing of the letters posted and all that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I don't believe that is within the rule. They may seek additional commentary to other means, but I don't believe that while the comment and review period is underway that they can have individual discussions. But again, I'm not a rules expert.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay, that's helpful. I appreciate it. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Your next question comes from the line of <a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/search/transcripts?term=Matt+Burnell&amp;sasource=participant\">Matt Burnell</a> with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Good afternoon, gentlemen. Just I guess administrative question, it looks like there's a really sizable increase in other revenue in your reported income statement. I guess I'm just trying to get a little more color as to what the change was there in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Sorry, Matt; can't do that one. I'll give you the usual line, if you call our crack IR staff after the completion of this call, they will get you that information. I apologize.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I appreciate that's a little bit in the weeds. Just to pull up a little bit from the weeds; you mentioned on July 24<sup> </sup>that there was a transfer of a portion of a liquidity portfolio from corporate into ICG, at the same time you also increased the allocated TCE into that business. What was the size of that portfolio that you transferred and what effect might that have going forward on ROCE in that business?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I can't recall the exact size. It was a fairly sizable number, something like a $130 billion or so. Again, we can get you the exact number. Again, that's more reflective of some of the deposit taking activities that are resident in the transaction services business. While we had the -- they tend to generate then high quality liquid assets that we hold, we were -- those things used to be resident in our corp other segment. And so, we felt that there was a better measurement to act from a performance point of view to actually push those assets into the business themselves. And I think you can see that it's had a small impact on the capital than attributed to ICG. That capital is up a couple of billion dollars from quarter-to-quarter. It's going to drive down their ROA. But we think it's a better measure of what the real ROA is that we have coming out of that business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And presumably it doesn't affect the overall Citicorp -- that you are reporting and tracking again?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">No. From a Citicorp, or from a city group point of view, it's a right pocket left pocket, we just thought that it was a better way of measuring performance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay, Thanks very much. That's it from me.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Not a problem.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Your next question comes from the line of <a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/search/transcripts?term=Erika+Najarian&amp;sasource=participant\">Erika Najarian</a> with Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Q - <a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/search/transcripts?term=Erika+Najarian&amp;sasource=participant\">Erika Najarian</a></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Yes, good afternoon. My question have been asked and answered. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Thank you, Erika.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Your next question comes from the line of <a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/search/transcripts?term=Ken+Usdin&amp;sasource=participant\">Ken Usdin</a> with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ken Usdin</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Thanks. Hi, Mike and John. A question on just CCAR and the limitations, it's clear that CET 1 was not so much limited [ph] as much as Tier 1 in total. You guys have previously talked about raising about 4 billion preferred this year as a helper on that side of things. I'm just wondering just post this year CCAR, can you give us some thoughts about just the outcomes around limitations and any views that you might have that maybe different around the magnitude of preferred issuance you might need to think about for this year and looking ahead?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>A - <a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/search/transcripts?term=Mike+Corbat&amp;sasource=participant\">Mike Corbat</a></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">No, we still think that $4 billion is about the right level of issuance that we'll have this year. We'll give you further guidance next week when we conduct the Fixed Income call, but I don't expect that number to increase. The important thing about the CCAR, don't forget CCAR is an exercise that goes out over nine quarter. And so it's really what gets reflected in the various CCAR calculations is the totality of your capital plan, including issuances as well as redemption, the use of capital repurchases over that nine-quarter period. We're still comfortable with the guidance that we'd given as far as the level of preferred stock issuance that we need to do.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ken Usdin</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay, understood; great. And then second question, you spoke to the drag that have been impacting the international consumer businesses from the spread compression and the regulatory changes, can you talk a little bit more about just qualitatively the international markets, LATAM and Asia, and any impact you are seeing from FX not so much in the translation effects because that's pretty clear that that's a net neutral, but just in terms of the economies in general, organic and secure growth, and how you are feeling about those businesses? Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yes. I mean we still look -- obviously -- globally, GDP growth is less than what we would hope for, and I don't think we are alone in that, but we still see good opportunities in markets; India for instance, is doing very well. It's likely that India is going to emerge as the economy with the strongest GDP growth this year as it outdistances China, but we continue to invest on our franchises throughout Asia, and we are getting good driver growth, the deposit levels, the loan levels; so we feel really good about the strength of our overall Asia franchise. Unlike so many other things these are patches that we have to manage our way through, where you are going to get some regulatory headwinds, you are going to have some slowdown in GDP, so that might mitigate some of the -- it might cause you to lessen the pace of some of your investments in those countries, but it doesn't stop the fact that we are still looking to grow our Asia consumer business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ken Usdin</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And then, last just clarification, John, you earlier had mentioned that maybe China offset, or keep key holdings profitable on a yearly basis this year into next year, and I'm just wondering is the potential debt pay down considered after the sale of OneMain considered in the helping part of next year as well?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yes, very much so, very much so.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ken Usdin</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay, understood. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Hi, Eric.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Hi, how are you, John? Just a couple of questions; first, as it relates to the Costco portfolio, can you just describe how the price discovery works on that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I'm not quite sure that we've released the contractual terms on that, but just to say that there is a process put in place by which a purchase price can be set between the two parties, and we ultimately feel that we will reach agreement on an appropriate purchase price, because we think it's in both of our best interest to have the portfolio transferred.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And I guess what I'm trying to just understand is to the extent that there is obviously a difference in view on pricing, how does that -- what is the mechanism for resolution?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">There is a mechanism, and mechanism leads to a choice as to whether or not the portfolio ultimately is transferred.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Although we don't think that's where it's going to go.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay. And then on a different topic, and there has obviously been some press speculation about legal authority and their interest in getting one of your legal entities to plead guilty to an issue. And I guess I'm not asking obviously to comment directly on that, but I guess my question is to the extent that, that does happen for your banking entity in the United States, how does the investment community think about the operational risk that, that creates for you? For example, does it create risk to your licenses? Does it create risk to certain counterparties who may or may not be able to interact with you on a go-forward basis? How do we frame our understanding of those risks?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Eric, we don't comment on individual litigation or regulatory matters. Our specific reserving actions unless it's related to specific settlements that we are announcing and since we don't comment on these things because they ultimately are hypotheticals, I'm really not going to comment then on your hypothetical.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay, I understood. Thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">All right.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer and Company. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Chris Kotowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Yes, hi. I wonder if you could just talk how do the redemption of high cost debt work, so just hypothetically let's say is that the proceeds or is that the gain that is the driver and how much you can do? So, if hypothetically you sell a business for $1 billion in proceeds and you have a $100 million gain, can you buyback a $100 million of debt or a billion or is the constraining factor, that is got to be -- the redemption cost have to be less than 100 million?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Your last one, the constraining factor is the cost of the redemption. So if I've got a $100 million dollar gain, I should be able to retire debt that would generate a $100 million loss that would cancel out the gain and the loss, producing a zero impact on net income, and we would have the ongoing benefit of the debt being retired, therefore lessening interest charges in the future periods.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Chris Kotowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay. And this is either presumably part of the CCAR capital plan or doesn't require specific approval for all that, right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Either one.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Chris Kotowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Oh, okay. All right. Thank you. That's it from me.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead with your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Yes, I just have one quick question; with regards to what you mentioned about -- potentially looking at some of GE's assets relative to your guidance at the balance seems to be at or below its current size over the year. Does that mean your guidance excludes any potential acquisitions?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>A - <a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/search/transcripts?term=Mike+Corbat&amp;sasource=participant\">Mike Corbat</a></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">We would say that there is something that we think is extraordinary and creates real value. We would certainly be willing to put that on if it's accretive in the ways we want a look at it, but the other levers we pull is that we've maintained a flat balance sheet while investing in our business in loan growth by the continued shrinkage of holding. So depending on the size of the asset and the nature of it, we might be able to create room through holdings, or if it works extraordinary or something we thought of merit, we could certainly add it to the balance sheet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I just want to be clear; I mean the comments that I made as far as the balance sheet size is related to this year. I'm not saying that we will never grow the balance sheet in '16, '17, '18; that was a very specific comment as related to the other comments on the balance of the year. It will be doubtful that any significant portfolio of assets we would actually be able to close on this year. So the guidance stays for this year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay, great. And just one follow-up question; was there any gain from moving out OneMain and the held-for-sale?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Is there what, I'm sorry?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Any gain from moving -- you said I think the OneMain operations have moved the held-for-sale?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Oh, yes, no, no, no. There's no gain associated with the movement from -- into held-for-sale.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Not a problem.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Thank you. We have no further questions in the queue at this time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Susan Kendall</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Great. Thank you all for joining us this morning. If you have any follow-up questions, please reach out to Investor Relations, and we look forward to speak with you again soon.
