(Operator Instructions) At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, stock-based compensation expense, taxes, earnings per share, and future products. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">For more information, please refer to the Risk Factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2009, as amended, the Form 10-Q for the first three quarters of fiscal 2010 and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today along with the attached press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information which speaks as of their respective dates.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Apple's CFO, Peter Oppenheimer, for introductory remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you, Nancy. Thank you for joining us. We're extremely pleased to report the conclusion of a great fiscal year for Apple with outstanding results for the September quarter. Our innovative product lineup is the best ever and customer response has been tremendous. As a result, we set new all-time records for Mac, iPhone and iPad sales in the September quarter, and we are thrilled to report the highest quarterly revenue and earnings in Apple's history.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Revenue for the quarter was $20.34 billion, an increase of more than $8.1 billion over the prior September quarter's result, representing growth of 67%. The very strong growth was fueled primarily by record iPhone sales, the tremendous popularity of iPad and our best Mac quarter ever.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Operating margin was $5.45 billion, representing 26.8% of revenue. Net income was $4.31 billion, which exceeded our previous quarterly earnings record by $930 million and represented 70% growth over the year-ago quarter's earnings. These results translated to earnings per share of $4.64.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Turning to the details of the quarter, I'd like to begin with our Mac products and services. We set a new quarterly record with sales of almost 3.9 million Macs, exceeding the previous record established in the June quarter by over 400,000. This represents 27% year-over-year growth, more than double IDC's latest published estimate of 11% growth for the market overall in the September quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We experienced strong double-digit growth in both Mac desktop and portable categories led by very strong sales of iMac which was updated in July and the continued popularity of the MacBook Pro and MacBook. Mac growth was strong in each of our geographic segments, led by Asia-Pacific at 56% year-over-year and Japan at 49%. We began and ended the quarter with between three and four weeks of Mac channel inventory.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Moving to our music products, we sold nearly 9.1 million iPods compared to 10.2 million in the year-ago quarter. In September, we announced a great new lineup of iPods for the holiday season, including our redesigned iPod Shuffle featuring clickable buttons, the reinvented iPod Nano with multi-touch and the new iPod touch with Retina display and FaceTime video calling.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">iPod's share of the U.S. market for MP3 players remains at over 70% based on the latest monthly data published by NPD. iPod also continues to be the top selling MP3 player and gained share internationally year-over-year in most of the countries we track based on the latest data published by GfK. We remain within our target range of four to six weeks of iPod channel inventory on a look-back basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">The iTunes Store also had another strong quarter with revenue over $1 billion. In September, we launched iTunes 10, including a number of new features such as $0.99 TV rentals, AirPlay wireless music playback and Ping, which offers social music discovery to millions of iTunes users in 23 countries. We also introduced new Apple TV which provides a simple way to watch movies and TV shows on your HDTV for the breakthrough price of just $99.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">I'd now like to turn to iPhone. We were extremely pleased to have sold 14.1 million iPhones compared to just under 7.4 million in the previous September quarter. This represents 91% year-over-year growth and is well ahead of IDC's latest published estimate of 64% growth for the global smart phone market overall in the September quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Recognized revenue from iPhone handset and accessories sales was $8.82 billion during the quarter compared with $4.61 billion in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 92%. The sales value of iPhones alone was about $8.6 billion which yields an ASP of about $610.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">At the end of the September quarter, we had iPhone distribution through 166 carriers in 89 countries. We continue to experience very strong year-over-year growth, particularly in Asia, Europe and Japan where iPhone sales more than doubled year-over-year. We were very happy to be shipping iPhone 4 in China as of the last day of the September quarter, and we've been very pleased with the customer response to date.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Last month, J.D. Power and Associates announced that for the fourth consecutive time, Apple ranks highest in its survey of customer satisfaction among manufacturers of smart phones, citing particularly strong performance and ease of operation, operating system, features and physical design.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Adoption of iPhone within the enterprise continues to accelerate. In fact, since we've shipped iPhone 4, we've seen extraordinary growth from 60% to more than 80% of Fortune 500 companies deploying or piloting iPhone. Enterprise CIOs continue to add iPhone to their approved device list worldwide.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Most recently, Fortune 500 companies like Procter &amp; Gamble, General Electric, Pfizer, Allstate, and Cardinal Health and Global 500 accounts such as Aviva Group, Total, Novartis, Roche and Sanofi-Aventis have made iPhone available to their employees.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We ended the quarter with about 3.3 million iPhones in channel inventory, a sequential increase of about 825,000 to support the launch of iPhone 4. We continue to have a sizeable backlog and believe we could have sold even more iPhones if we had been able to supply them.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Turning to iPad, we're thrilled with its momentum. In just the second quarter of availability, we sold almost 4.2 million iPads with distribution in 26 countries by the end of the September quarter. We're seeing great enthusiasm for iPad from consumers, educators and businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Enterprise CIOs are adding iPad to their approved device list at an impressive rate. Since the launch of iPad, over 65% of the Fortune 100 is already deploying or piloting iPad. Some recent examples of companies approving iPad include, Procter &amp; Gamble, Lowes, Hyatt, NBC Universal and Novartis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Recognized revenue from sales of iPad and iPad accessories during the quarter was $2.8 billion. The sales value of iPads alone was about $2.7 billion, which yields an ASP of about $645. We were able to increase the supply of iPads over the course of the quarter, building channel inventory by about 500,000 units to end the quarter with between three and four weeks of channel inventory below our target range of four to six weeks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We are expanding U.S. iPad distribution to include Wal-Mart, Target, Verizon and AT&amp;T stores. We are also expanding distribution internationally.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Combining iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch, we surpassed cumulative iOS device sales by 125 million last month. During the September quarter, we released iOS 4.1, which builds on the innovations of iOS 4 bringing FaceTime video calling, multi-tasking, folders and Game Center to iPod Touch in addition to iPhone customers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">And in November, we plan to release iOS 4.2 which will bring many of the great new features of iOS 4 to iPad. iOS 4.2 will also include AirPrint, Apple's new printing architecture that automatically finds printers on local networks and enables printing from iOS devices over Wi-Fi without the need to install drivers or download software.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">The App Store continues to be an unparalleled success. There are now over 200,000 registered iOS developers who continue to bring outstanding and creative new apps to the iOS platform, including over 65,000 game and entertainment titles and over 30,000 apps designed specifically for iPad.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">And we launched iAd in July, which provides marketers with the ability to place interactive ads in popular apps for iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad. We were very happy with results so far. Customers are loving the media-rich ads and marketers are very pleased with viewer engagement.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">I'd now like to turn to the Apple retail stores, which had a record-breaking quarter. Retail revenue was $3.57 billion compared to $2.04 billion in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 75%. Our stores sold a record 874,000 Macs compared to 670,000 Macs in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 30%. About half the Macs sold in our stores during the September quarter were to customers who had never owned a Mac before.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We opened 24 stores during the September quarter, 16 of which were outside the United States, including spectacular stores in Beijing, Shanghai, London and Paris. Our new Beijing and Shanghai stores opened on the last day of the quarter, and first-day sales from both stores exceeded all previous store openings. Our four China stores are our highest traffic stores in the world and are among our highest performing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We also entered our eleventh country, with the opening of stores in Barcelona and Madrid. That brings us to a total of 317 stores worldwide as at the end of the quarter, with 84 of them outside the United States. With an average of 301 stores opened during the September quarter, average revenue per store was $11.8 million compared to $7.8 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 52%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Retail segment margin was $917 million compared to $564 million in the year-ago quarter. We hosted a record 74.5 million visitors in our stores during the quarter compared to 45.9 million visitors in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 62%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">As we look ahead to fiscal 2011, we see great opportunity to continue our retail growth with our focus on international expansion. In total, we expect to open 40 to 50 stores in our fiscal 2011 with over 50% of them outside the United States. We will also begin replacing several stores in the United States to get them right-sized for Apple's current product line and to meet our service goals.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Total company gross margin was 36.9%, which was 190 basis points above our guidance. About two-thirds of this favorability was driven by lower commodity and other costs, and the remainder was mostly attributable to a better-than-planned mix of iPhone sales.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Operating expenses were $2.07 billion and included $185 million in stock-based compensation expense. OI&amp;E was $14 million and the tax rate for the quarter was 21%, about five points below our guidance, largely a result of two factors. First, we had a higher mix of foreign earnings than we planned. Second, we had some discrete one-time tax benefits in the quarter as well. Our tax rate for fiscal 2010 was about 24.5%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to cash, our cash flow short term and long term marketable securities totaled $51 billion at the end of the September quarter compared to $45.8 billion at the end of the June quarter, an increase of $5.2 billion. Cash flow from operations was $5.7 billion. The September quarter was the culmination of a monumental year for Apple. In fiscal 2010, we launched several new Macs; establishing record sales of over $13.6 million and achieving 31% year-over-year sales growth, significantly outpacing the growth of the overall pc market.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We introduced the tremendously popular iPhone 4 with breakthrough features including FaceTime and Retina display fueling full-year sales of 40 million iPhones, an increase of 93% over fiscal 2009. We launched the groundbreaking iPad, selling nearly 7.5 million to delighted customers in two quarters alone. We also brought great new features to iOS and iTunes, and continue to innovate with completely new designs for iPod.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">And as a result, we generated record revenue of over $65 billion, an increase of over $22 billion year-over-year or 52%. Earnings of $14 billion grew even faster at 70% year-over-year. To put this growth in a perspective, in fiscal 2010, Apple generated almost five times the revenue and more than 10 times the earnings it did just five years earlier in fiscal 2005.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be about $23 billion compared to $15.7 billion in the December quarter last year. We expect gross margins to be about 36% reflecting approximately $52 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be about $2.325 billion including about $250 million related to stock-based compensation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We expect OI&amp;E to be about $65 million. And we expect the tax rate to be about 25.5%. We're targeting EPS of about $4.80. In closing, we're thrilled with our record September quarter and fiscal year 2010 results. We're very enthusiastic about our innovative product line-up and our significant opportunities for growth as we head into fiscal 2011.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">And we remain extremely confident in our new product pipeline. Before taking your questions, I would like to turn the call over to our CEO, Steve Jobs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Steve Jobs</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As most of you know, I don't usually participate in Apple's earnings calls since you are all in such capable hands with Peter and Tim. But I just couldn't help dropping by for our first $20 billion quarter. I would like to chat about a few things and then stay for the rest of the Q&amp;A if that's alright.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">First, let me discuss iPhone. We sold 14.1 million iPhones in the quarter which represents a 91% unit growth over the year-ago quarter and was well ahead of IDC's latest published estimate of 64% growth for the global smartphone market in the September quarter. And it handily beat RIM's 12.1 million Blackberry's sold in their most recent quarter ending in August. We've now passed RIM, and I don't seem them catching up with us in the foreseeable future. They must move beyond their area of strength and comfort into the unfamiliar territory of trying to become a software platform company.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">I think it's going to be a challenge for them to create a competitive platform and to convince developers to create apps for yet a third software platform after iOS and Android. With 300,000 apps on Apple's App Store, RIM has a high mountain ahead of them to climb.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Well, what about Google? Last week, Eric Schmidt reiterated that they are activating 200,000 Android devices per day. And have around 90,000 apps in their App Store. For comparison, Apple has activated around 275,000 iOS devices per day on average for the past 30 days with a peak of almost 300,000 iOS devices per day on a few of those days. And Apple has 300,000 apps on its App Store.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Unfortunately, there is no solid data on how many Android phones are shipped each quarter. We hope that manufacturers will soon start reporting the number of Android handsets they ship each quarter. But today that just isn't the case. Gartner reported that around 10 million Android phones were shipped in the June quarter and we await to see if iPhone or Android was the winner in this most recent quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Google loves to characterize Android as open, and iOS and iPhone as closed. We find this a bit disingenuous and clouding the real difference between our two approaches. The first thing most of us think about when we hear the work open is Windows which is available on a variety of devices. Unlike Windows, however, where most pc's have the same user interface and run the same app, Android is very fragmented. Many Android OEMs, including the two largest, HTC and Motorola install proprietary user interfaces to differentiate themselves from the commodity Android experience. The users will have to figure it all out. Compare this with iPhone, where every handset works the same.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Twitter client, Twitter Deck, recently launched their app for Android. They reported that they had to contend with more than 100 different versions of Android software on 244 different handsets. The multiple hardware and software iterations present developers with a daunting challenge. Many Android apps work only on selected Android handsets running selected Android versions. And this is for handsets that have been shipped less than 12 months ago. Compare this with iPhone, where there are two versions of the software, the current and the most recent predecessor to test against.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">In addition to Google's own app marketplace, Amazon, Verizon and Vodafone have all announced that they are creating their own app stores for Android. So there will be at least four app stores on Android, which customers must search among to find the app they want and developers will need to work with to distribute their apps and get paid. This is going to be a mess for both users and developers. Contrast this with Apple's integrated App Store, which offers users the easiest-to-use largest app store in the world, preloaded on every iPhone. Apple's App Store has over three times as many apps as Google's marketplace and offers developers' one-stop shopping to get their apps to market easily and to get paid swiftly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Even if Google were right, and the real issue is closed versus open, it is worthwhile to remember that open systems don't always win. Take Microsoft's PlaysForSure music strategy, which use the PC model, which Android uses as well, of separating the software components from the hardware components. Even Microsoft finally abandoned this open strategy in favor of copying Apple's integrated approach with their Zoom Player, unfortunately leaving their OEMs empty-handed in the process. Google flirted with this integrated approach with their Nexus One phone.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">In reality, we think the open versus closed argument is just a smokescreen to try and hide the real issue, which is, what's best for the customer, fragmented versus integrated. We think Android is very, very fragmented and becoming more fragmented by the day. And as you know, Apple's strives for the integrated model so that the user isn't forced to be the systems integrator.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We see tremendous value in having Apple rather than our users' be the systems integrator. We think this is a huge strength of our approach compared to Google's. When selling to users who want their devices to just work, we believe integrated will trump fragmented every time. And we also think our developers can be more innovative if they can target a singular platform rather than a hundred variants. They can put their time into innovative new features rather than testing on hundreds of different handsets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So we are very committed to the integrated approach, no matter how many times Google tries to characterize it as closed. And we are confident that it will triumph over Google's fragmented approach, no matter how many times Google tries to characterize it as open.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Second, I'd like to comment on the avalanche of tablets poised to enter the market in the coming months. First, it appears to be just a handful of credible entrants, not exactly an avalanche. Second, almost all of them use seven-inch screens as compared to iPad's near 10-inch screen. Let's start there. One naturally thinks that a seven-inch screen would offer 70% of the benefits of a 10-inch screen. Unfortunately, this is far from the truth. The screen measurements are diagonal, so that a seven-inch screen is only 45% as large as iPad's 10-inch screen. You heard me right; just 45% as large</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">If you take an iPad and hold it upright in portrait view and draw an imaginary horizontal line halfway down the screen, the screens on the seven-inch tablets are a bit smaller than the bottom half of the iPad display. This size isn't sufficient to create great tablet apps in our opinion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Well, one could increase the resolution of the display to make up for some of the difference. It is meaningless, unless your tablet also includes sandpaper, so that the user can sand down their fingers to around one quarter of the present size. Apple's done extensive user-testing on touch interfaces over many years, and we really understand this stuff. There are clear limits of how close you can physically place elements on a touch screen before users cannot reliably tap, flick or pinch them. This is one of the key reasons we think the 10-inch screen size is the minimum size required to create great tablet apps.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Third, every tablet user is also a smartphone user. No tablet can compete with the mobility of a smartphone, its ease of fitting into your pocket or purse, its unobtrusiveness when used in a crowd. Given that all tablet users will already have a smartphone in their pockets, giving up precious display area to fit a tablet in our pockets is clearly the wrong tradeoff. The seven-inch tablets are tweeners, too big to compete with a smartphone and too small to compete with an iPad.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Fourth, almost all of these new tablets use Android software, but even Google is telling the tablet manufacturers not to use their current release, Froyo, for tablets, and to wait for a special tablet release next year. What does it mean when your software suppliers does not (inaudible) to use their software in your tablet? And what does it mean when you ignore them and use it anyway?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Fifth, iPad now has over 35,000 apps on the App Store. This new crop of tablets will have near zero.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">And sixth and last, our potential competitors are having a tough time coming close to iPad's pricing, even with their far smaller, far less expensive screens. The iPad incorporates everything we have learnt about building high value products from iPhones, iPods and Macs. We create our own A4 chip, our own software, our own battery chemistry, our own enclosure, our own everything. And this results in an incredible product at a great price. The proof of this will be in the pricing of our competitor's products which will likely offer less for more.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">These are among the reasons we think the current crop of seven-inch tablets are going to be DOA, Dead on Arrival. Their manufacturers will learn the painful lesson that their tablets are too small and increase the size next year, thereby abandoning both customers and developers who jumped on the seven-inch bandwagon with an orphan product. Sounds like lots of fun ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So thank you, and let me turn it back to Peter for the Q&amp;A session.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p6\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">(Operator Instructions) And your first question will come from Richard Gardner with Citi.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Richard Gardner - Citi</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">I had two quick ones, if I could. One is the supply constraints on iPad. Could you talk about how severe the supply constraints are on that product and how quickly you expect it to improve? And then a follow-up for Peter on gross margin please.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Relative to iPad supply/demand, we\u2019ve got into a balanced situation in September with the limited number of distribution points in the 26 countries where we sold the iPad. And so we exited the quarter in a supply position that allows us to expand distribution prior to the holidays as we've planned for sometime. And hopefully you've seen some of the recent announcements of added partners in the United States. We're also expanding internationally, and will be launching additional countries as the quarter goes on.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Richard Gardner - Citi</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And then Peter, you mentioned several sequential tailwinds for gross margin during the September quarter. Could you talk about the headwinds in the quarter and what impact they had on gross margin sequentially, please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">I'm sorry, Rich, for the September quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Richard Gardner - Citi</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">For the September quarter, yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">In our last conference call, we talked about several things that we thought would cause margins to come down some. And all those things did play out, but margins came down actually about half of what we thought that they would. And we did a bit better in the quarter because commodity and other costs were better than we thought, and we sold more iPhones than we had planned to.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">From Piper Jaffray, we have Gene Munster.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">If you can talk a little bit about the iPad opportunity you went through, and gave us some good insight in terms of the competitive landscape. But as analysts, we're here kind of trying to put some estimates out there and we're not doing a great job of trying to figure out this trajectory in the iPad.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Can you help us understand how you think about the business a year or two years down the road in terms of size of your overall business, impact on enterprise, education, anything you can give to help us on that front? And then a follow-up question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Steve Jobs</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Well, the iPad is clearly going to affect notebook computers. And I think the iPad proves, it's not a question of if, it's a question of when. And I think a lot of development and progress that will occur over the next few years. But we're already seeing tremendous interest in iPad from education, and much to my surprise, from business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">We haven't pushed it real hard in business, and it's being grabbed out of our hands. And I talk to people everyday in all kinds of businesses that are using iPads, all the way from Boards of Directors that are shipping iPads around instead of board books, down to nurses and doctors in hospitals and other large and small businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So the more time that passes, the more I am convinced that we've got a tiger by the tail here. And this is a new model of computing which we've already got tens of millions of people trained on with the iPhone. And that lends itself to lots of different aspects of life both personal, educational and business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So, I see it as very general purpose, and I see it as really big. And the timing, one could argue about the timing endlessly, but I don't think one could argue that it's going to happen anymore.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Do you think this could be your second-biggest business in iPhone?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Steve Jobs</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">I try to not predict, I try to just report. So, we'll keep you posted. As you know, we're already shipping more of them than Macs after just a few quarters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">On the Flash side, any updates on your stance on Flash?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Steve Jobs</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Flash memory; we love Flash memory.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Peter, just one quick question. Our tracks were that you had about three weeks lead-time in most of your countries on the iPhone throughout the quarter. You mentioned you could have sold more iPhones. How do you think about what the true demand could have been in the quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I think that which you're referring to is the quote that's on the Apple Online Store. What I would say is that the demand in all countries is absolutely staggering. And at this point I can't predict when supply will meet demand. I feel great about our ability to move the supply and the sales up from an 8 million kind of number to over 14 million. But it's clear, last quarter that wasn't enough. And we are obviously working on that, but it will take some time to increase further.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Were you more supply-constrained in the September quarter versus the June quarter? Totally different dynamics in the quarter, but any perspective on the two quarters?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">It's clear that the iPhone 4 and the announcement of iPhone 4 and the demand for it took the demand to an entirely different level. And we had anticipated a very different level, but it's even higher than that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">From RBC Capital Markets, we'll go to Mike Abramsky.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Mike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Steve, appreciate your commentary. You know, you are the tablet market right now. And this is I think the second time now you've come on to talk about or certainly at one time during your presentation to talk about competition. And I am just wondering, if much like Apple encroaching on whims, monopoly and enterprise, if you think that Apple's going to able to sustain share growth for tablets amid some of those new competitive headwinds?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Some of those players may try different things and strategies like tethering and Flash, multi-tasking, less content and app restrictions and subsidized pricing. And just wondered if you think that, that may create itself a more fragmented market and how you see that rolling out with regard to Apple?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Steve Jobs</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I have a hard time envisioning what those strategies you mentioned are. I mean, in terms of pricing, so far, the little we've seen, the tablets with far less functionality are having a hard time matching us in price. Flash hasn't presented any problem at all. As you know, most of the video on the web is now available in HTML 5. And having the iTunes media store and over 35,000 apps on the App Store for iPad dwarfs anything else. And we think we have a very good product here that's going to be hard to match, and we're not done. We're working on a lot of things for the future.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So I don't know exactly what these strategies are. And we've priced iPad pretty aggressively. So we're out to win this one.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Mike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And just lastly, the smartphones, do you see that as a zero sum game?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Steve Jobs</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Well, as you know the largest market of phones today around the world are non smartphones. And so over the next several years, many of those non-smartphones are going to convert to smartphones. And the pie is going to continue to grow, and I think there will be room for some number of companies to be successful. But eventually, as most of those phones do convert to smartphones, it will turn into a zero sum game or at least a lot closer to that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">But I think right now it's a battle for developers and a battle for the mindshare of developers and a battle for the mindshare of customers. And right now iPhone and Android are winning that battle.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">It's Benjamin Reitzes with Barclays Capital.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Benjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">First, for Peter, can you just talk a little bit about gross margins? You have gross margin guidance of 36. With component prices still favorable and probably more iPhone's being sold sequentially, can you just talk about why margins would go down sequentially, which seems also that you released the revenue on the bumper program? And then I have a follow-up for Steve, if you don't mind.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Ben, in providing our guidance we thought about each of those factors that you cited, and we do see a small sequential decline. This has been primarily driven by a higher than expected mix of new iPod's that we just recently announced, and more iPad sales, and which as Steve said, we've been very aggressive with our pricing and are delivering great value to customers. So it's the higher mix of those on a sequential basis that I see impacting the gross margin slightly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Benjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. And then Steve, can you just comment on how your hobby is doing, Apple TV? You took the hard drive out of there, and it seems like Apple is moving more to a streaming model work, you know, potentially a lot of other things, and I was just wondering what your thoughts were for the Apple TV, maybe that kind of business model proliferating into more products. But I was wondering how Apple TV is doing and what's your thoughts going forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Steve Jobs</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Well, we don't talk about unannounced products, but I'm happy to tell you what I know about Apple TV. We have gone to streaming model on Apple TV; it's complete streaming. So all the content is rented from the iTunes store or is streamed from your computer, or soon to be streamed from your iPhone or iPad with AirPlay. And so how is our new model of Apple TV doing? Well, I can report that in just a very short amount of time we've already sold a quarter million of them, over 250,000, and we're thrilled with that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I think that it's a great product and I think its $99 price point is very enticing. And I think when we get the AirPlay stuff in place before the end of this year, it's going to give another big reason for people to buy it. So we're really happy with how it's turned out.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">The next question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">First, for Peter, how much of the sequential decline in gross margin related to the iPhone in the September quarter and particularly the bumper program?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Katy, we've recorded a revenue deferral of just over $100 million in the September quarter for the bumper program. We would expect to record that in revenue in the December quarter. We did ship a number of bumpers in the September quarter, and that is reflected in our gross margin, as is the number that we expect to ship in the December quarter. That's reflected in our guidance as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And just to be clear, is the iPhone the product segment that dropped the most sequentially as it relates to gross margins? I guess people are just asking what drove the sequential down tick which we haven't seen for some time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">You mean in the September quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yes, in the September quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Well again, this was not a surprise to us. And we, on our last conference call highlighted that we would have a higher mix of iPhone 4 sales, and we were very aggressive with feature function there. So it had a different gross margin than its predecessor product. We also sold more iPads. Again, we were very aggressive there with our pricing. And we had the bumper program and some one-time items that occurred in June that we said wouldn't occur in September.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So these were sort of the factors we saw bringing down gross margin. To some extent, each of them did occur in the September quarter, but we ended up doing about 50% better than we thought as a result of the commodity market and selling more iPhones.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And then Steve, just as a follow-up. It seems like you fundamentally believe that Apple should be able to out-ship Android if you add up all the mobile devices over time. What are the key risks you're managing the company to make sure you don't lose that lead, whether it's distribution, or pricing, or features? What do you think the biggest risks are that you need to watch carefully?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Steve Jobs</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Well, our goal is to make the best devices in the world. It's not to be the biggest; as you know, Nokia is the biggest. And we admire them for being able to ship the number of handsets that they do. But we don't aspire to be like them. They are good at being like them. We want to be like us, and we want to make the best ones.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So in our part of the market, Android is our biggest competitor. They out-shipped us in the June quarter as we were transitioning to iPhone 4. They out-shipped us for the first time according to Gartner's numbers, which we think are pretty accurate. And so we're waiting to find out what happened in this quarter. We'll find out. I don't know how we'll find out, but Gartner will put out some new numbers, and maybe others will, so one of these days we'll eventually learn.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And I imagine we'll be competing with them for quite some time. But we have very different approaches. And we believe in our approach very strongly is providing users products that just work. And we think there is lots of users that want that in the world, and their approach is very different than that. And there maybe lots of users that want that their approach as well. But we're going to pursue ours and we think that's the winning approach in the end.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And that will come from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I guess this is for both Steve and Tim. I wanted to just better understand your aspirations for iPhone and iPad. Tim, I think I've heard you say, \"Look, we think about the Mac business as being one where we make the best products, but we're competing against kind of strong income and power in Microsoft. And we don't aspire to have high market share.\"</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">In your iPod business it was kind of the opposite. You had very high volume, you drove price points down to entry points in the marketplace. And you have more than 50% market share globally. I think when we've talked about it in the past, you've actually said that you view the iPhone business as being more akin to the iPod business in terms of your aspiration.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Steve, it sounded like that wasn't really consistent with what you said. You said very clearly, we don't want to be Nokia, we just to want to make good phone. So perhaps, you can help me better understand how we should think about your aspiration for both the iPhone and the iPad. Steve, you also made a comment about seven inch screens aren't going to cut it, and implying that you're not going to go down to those lower price points.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Is your aspiration for iPhone and iPad to be volume players and market leaders? Or is it simply to make good products? And if you have smaller share like you do in Mac, that's fine. Can you help me with that, please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Steve Jobs</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Sure, and I'll let Tim say what he's going to say too. First of all, Nokia makes $50 handsets, and we don't know how to make a great smartphone for $50. We're not smart enough to figure that one out yet, but believe me I'll let you know, when we do. So our goal is to make a really breakthrough great product. Make the best products in every industry that we compete in and to drive the cost down, while constantly making the products better at the same time. That's what we did with iPod.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We updated our products many times every year, with better functionality oftentimes at the same price, and sometimes at a lower price. And it was this relentless improvement, and in some cases a lower price that was able to beat our competition and yield the market share that it did. And as you know, we have a very low market share in the phone market in the single digits, in terms of all the handsets. And we have a very high market share now in tablets, because we're the first mover.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">But we don't think about it that way. The reason we wouldn't make a seven inch tablet isn't because we don't want to hit a price point, it's because we don't think you can make a great tablet with a seven inch screen. We think it's too small to express the software that people want to put on these things. And we think as a software driven company, we think about the software strategies first.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And we know that software developers they're not going to deal real well with all these different size products, when they have to redo their software, every time a screen size changes. And they're not going to deal well with products where they can't put enough elements on the screen to build the kind of apps they want to build.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So when we make decisions on seven inch tablets, it's not about cost, it's about the value of the product when you factor in the software. You see what I'm getting at? So we're all about making the best products at aggressive prices. And that's what we will do and that's what we've done with the iPod, and that's what we will do with the iPad as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Tim, maybe you want to comment, if I could push you on that Steve. So if the market starts to move towards somewhat lower functionality smartphones in that migration of non-smartphones to smartphones that you talked about. If the market starts to move to dramatically lower price points, you feel you can't make an appropriate product that is good at those price points, you will cede share under those circumstances. Do I hear you correctly?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Steve Jobs</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">You're looking at it wrong. You're looking at it as a hardware person in a fragmented world. You're looking at it as a hardware manufacturer that doesn't really know much about software, who doesn't think about an integrated product, but assumes the software will somehow take care of itself. And you're sitting around saying, \"Well, how can we make this cheaper? Well, we can put on a smaller screen on it and a slower processor, and less memory.\" And you assume that the software will somehow just come alive on this product that you're dreaming of, but it won't. Because these app developers have taken advantage of the products that came before with faster processors, with larger screens, with more capabilities that they can take advantage of to make better apps for customers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And it's a hard one because it throws you right back into the beginning of that chicken and egg problem again to change all the assumptions on those developers. Most of them will not follow you, most of them will say, \"I'm sorry, but I'm not going to go back and write a watered down version of my app just because you've got this phone that you can sell for $50 less and you're begging me to write software for it.\"</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">One more if I may, please, Steve? You now have more than $50 billion in cash. You're generating more than $20 billion a year in cash; it rests very comfortably on your balance sheet, earning less than 1% interest. What is your aspiration for that cash? And why are you not more open to returning some of that cash to shareholders in the form of buybacks or dividend?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Steve Jobs</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Of course that's been suggested to us. We strongly believe that one or more very strategic opportunities may come along that we're in a unique position to take advantage of because of our strong cash position. And I think we've demonstrated a really strong track record of being very disciplined with the use of our cash. We don't let it burn a hole in our pocket, we don't allow it to motivate us to do stupid acquisitions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And so I think that we'd like to continue to keep our powder dry because we do feel that there are one or more strategic opportunities in the future. That's the biggest reason. And there are other reasons as well that we could go into. But that's the biggest one.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">From Cross Research, we'll hear from Shannon Cross.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Shannon Cross - Cross Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Steve and Tim, could you talk a little bit about the corporate opportunity? And what I'm looking for is sort how you're thinking about Apple as it's been positioned over the last several years, sort of more of a consumer focused, SMB focused company, but clearly there is a huge opportunity here with the iPad and the iPhone and probably at some point the Macs into the corporate world.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So how do you think about your position from a marketing standpoint, a sales standpoint? Any changes you need to make, or how are you sort of addressing that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">On the iPad, there have been some comments about this earlier, but just to give you some stats here, about two-thirds of the Fortune 100 are deploying or piloting iPad. And I don't know about you, but I've never seen an adoption like this in my life in enterprise. Enterprise is historically much slower moving on adoption. We're also seeing the iPad begin to pick up interest in K12 which is another market that historically adopts very, very slowly. And so the early data points look great. And as a matter of fact, we have built and are building additional capacity internally in the sales organizations, to call on businesses and obviously we have a huge amount of sales people already there calling on education institutions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">We're also enabling in training our carrier partners to do the same. You probably saw a announcement last week with AT&amp;T, and that's a direct result of customers wanting to buy the iPad on a postpaid type plan. And so we're putting a lot of energy in those. iPhone has followed a trajectory that gets into same kinds of numbers as I pointed on iPad where, or a little bit higher by now, is 85% of the Fortune 100 are deploying are deploying or piloting iPhone.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And so this isn't a hobby or something we're doing lightly. We put enormous energy in the company, in engineering, in software to build a number of enterprise features in the OS. You've seen that, it gets better and better as we step through the different OS releases. And we're building the sales capability for those groups as well. It's clear that both the phone and the iPad have an enormous opportunity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">The Mac is also increasingly getting pulled into an enterprise where the employees are able to select. And of course, this is a trend that we like to see, and that we think will continue in larger ways. But when people are given the choice, they would prefer a Mac, so Macs are being pulled in as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">We don't have as much distribution effort on that, but as we see if it gets any larger, we will move accordingly. The great thing is that we're maintaining our focus on the consumer, and the consumer is a forefront on thinking of all our products. And it's these consumers in the enterprise so to speak that are pulling these products in.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And so we're not developing two different lines like many companies do and have enterprise versions and consumer versions. This is another part of our simplistic approach to things that I think will pay us great dividend and is already starting to do so.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Shannon Cross - Cross Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And I had a follow-up for Peter, I am getting substantial questions, as I am sure everybody on the call is, just about gross margin. So one of the questions I have is, as you're seeing the increase in volume, is there any kind of a change in terms of sort of the scale leverage you have from a manufacturing standpoint? I know you guided to lower gross margins, but the Street of course was higher?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So, just anything you can give us in terms of color on the gross margins with the iPhone 4 in terms of how that's panning out and how we should think about start up costs that were associated with, both that as well as the iPad, just any color would be great?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">We don't provide product specific gross margins but we are always working aggressively to lower our costs whether it's the iPhone or any of our other products. I think we have a very good track record in this regard. And we were happy with our gross margins in the September quarter, they were ahead of what we thought. And we see them being just down slightly in the December quarter as we ship more iPods where we've been quite aggressive and continue to ship more iPads as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And our next question will come from Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I am interested in understanding demand from new carriers to take up iPhone 4 and whether or not you're seeing any pressure on subsidies as you look to expand your distribution networks on the phone business?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Chris, the pressure that I am getting is on supply. Virtually everyone we're doing business with wants more supply. So that's the pressure that I feel.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Can you give us some color, sorry if I missed this, I jumped on late, but some color in terms of where you are from a number of carriers with iPhone 4, how did you end the quarter? Do you have targets for the December quarter in terms of carrier penetration with existing relationships?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">We have, if you count at the country level, we have about 166 relationships that we ended the quarter with in about 89 countries. And so that's a significant expansion across from last year as we in many countries went from a single carrier relationship to more than one carrier.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">The latest country that we have done that in or that we've announced that in is Germany and we will be launching both with Vodafone and O2 together with our existing partner T-Mobile in Germany later this month.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And all 166 of the carriers have the phone 4 by year end, is that the target?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">With iPhone 4, we're in 85 of those 89 countries. And I believe that we will be in all 89 by the end of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And what is your experience then when you've gone non-exclusive from a subsidy and margin standpoint on the phone, have you had to give anything up in the past?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">We don't give specific information out on the margins. But I think you can look at our ASPs and see that they've generally stayed above $600, and that's despite opening up several markets from an exclusive market to a non-exclusive market.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Steve, you discussed competitors not matching Apple's price point so far on the tablet space. Why do you think you have an advantage on the price point for iPad versus the PC manufacturers?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Steve Jobs</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Well, I think part of it is because we engineer so much of it ourselves. The A4 chip inside it is an Apple creation; everything, again, as I mentioned from the battery chemistry to the enclosures. And we've learned a lot. We've learned a lot from the miniaturization we've done on iPods and iPhones. And we're a very high volume consumer electronics manufacturer.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So I think we've learned a lot. We've developed a lot of our own components where other have to buy them on the market with middlemen, getting their cut of things. I think we're systems architects and know how to build systems in a very efficient way. So I think this is a product we've been training for, for the last decade.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Thanks to everyone for joining us today.

[Operator Instructions] At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, stock-based compensation expense, taxes, earnings per share and future products. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2010, and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC this afternoon along with the attached press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information or speak as of their respective date. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Apple's CFO, Peter Oppenheimer, for introductory remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you, Nancy. Thank you for joining us. We are very pleased to report the outstanding results of our December quarter. The performance of our business was extremely strong, as we sold more Macs, iPhones and iPads than in any previous quarter in Apple's history. And as a result, we're thrilled to announce all-time record quarterly revenue and earnings. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Revenue for the quarter was $26.7 billion, an increase of more than $11 billion over the prior December quarter's result, representing growth of 71%. The robust revenue growth was fueled by record iPhone, iPad and Mac sales. Operating margin was over $7.8 billion, representing 29.3% of revenue. Net income was $6 billion, which exceeded our previous quarterly earnings record set in the September quarter by $1.7 billion, and represented 78% growth over the year-ago quarter's earnings. These results translated to earnings per share of $6.43. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Turning to the details of the quarter, I'd like to begin with our Mac products and services. We established a new quarterly record with sales of 4.13 million Macs, representing 23% growth over the year-ago quarter. That's almost 8x IDC's most recently published estimate of 3% growth for the PC market. We experienced strong sales growth in each of our geographic segments, with over 50% growth in both the Asia-Pacific region and Japan. The growth was fueled primarily by strong demand for the new MacBook Air, which was launched in October, as well as continued strong sales of MacBook Pro. Customers love the new thin and light unibody design of the MacBook Air, and the impressive responsiveness and reliability of its solid-state storage, while MacBook Pro continues to provide customers tremendous speed and high-performance graphics at an excellent value. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We ended the quarter with between three and four weeks of Mac channel inventory. We opened the Mac App Store in January 6, bringing what we've learned from iOS Apps to Mac users to make discovering, installing and updating apps easier than ever. The Mac App Store is available in 90 countries, and features more than 1,000 free and paid apps in categories like education, games, graphics and design, lifestyle, productivity and utility. We've been very pleased with customer response, with over 1 million downloads on the first day alone. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Moving to our music products. We sold 19.4 million iPods compared to 21 million in the year-ago quarter. We experienced continued strong sales of iPod touch, which grew 27% year-over-year and accounted for over 50% of all iPods sold during the quarter. iPod's share of the U.S. market for MP3 players remains at over 70% based on the latest monthly data published by NPD, and iPod continues to be the top-selling MP3 player in most countries we track based on the latest data published by GfK.  We ended the quarter within our target range of four to six weeks of iPod channel inventory. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">The iTunes Store generated another strong quarter with revenue exceeding $1.1 billion, thanks to strong sales of music, video and apps. We were extremely pleased to bring the legendary music of the Beatles to iTunes during the quarter and to introduce movies to the iTunes Store in Japan. And as we announced a few weeks ago, iTunes users are now renting and purchasing over 400,000 TV episodes and over 150,000 movies per day. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">I'd now like to turn to iPhone. We were thrilled to have sold 16.2 million iPhones compared to 8.7 million in the previous December quarter. This represents 86% year-over-year growth compared to IDC's latest published estimate of 70% growth for the global smartphone market overall in the December quarter. Recognized revenue from iPhone handset and accessory sales was $10.47 billion during the quarter, compared to $5.58 billion in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 88%. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">The sales value of iPhones alone was over $10.1 billion, which yields an ASP of about $625. At the end of the December quarter, we had iPhone distributions through 185 carriers in 90 countries. We continue to experience very strong year-over-year growth in all of our segments, with sales in the Asia-Pacific region and Japan both more than doubling year-over-year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Enterprise customers continue to embrace iPhone, with 88 of the Fortune 100 companies and almost 60% of the Financial Times Europe 100 companies now testing or deploying iPhones. Strong employee demand in custom app development are fueling deployment within the corporate sector. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Enterprise CIOs continue to add iPhone to their approved device list worldwide. Most recently, Fortune 500, like Wells Fargo, Archer Daniels Midland, DuPont, Staples, Starbucks and Genworth Financial, and Global 500 accounts such as Nissan Motor, BBVA [Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria], Standard Chartered Group and Danone, have made iPhone available to their employees. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We ended the quarter with about 3.5 million iPhones in channel inventory, a sequential increase of about 250k. We continue to have a sizable backlog, and believe we could have sold even more iPhones if we had been able to supply them. And we're thrilled to begin working with Verizon next month to offer iPhone 4 to its more than 93 million customers, as well as to new customers who want iPhone 4 on Verizon. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Turning to iPad. We continue to be thrilled with its momentum and customer interest. We sold 7.3 million iPads, a sequential increase of over 3 million, with distribution in 46 countries by the end of the December quarter. We continue to see great enthusiasm for iPads from consumer, business and education customers. Employee demand for iPad in the corporate environment remains strong, and the response to the product continues to be significant. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Enterprise CIOs are adding iPad to their approved device list at an amazing rate. Today, over 80% of the Fortune 100 are already deploying or piloting iPad, up from 65% in the September quarter. Some recent examples include JPMorgan Chase, Cardinal Health, Wells Fargo, Archer Daniels Midland, Sears Holdings and DuPont. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Recognized revenue from sales of iPad and iPad accessories during the quarter was $4.61 billion. The sales value by iPads alone was over $4.4 billion, which yields an ASP of about $600. We increased the supply of iPads during the quarter and expanded both the number of countries and the number of channel partners carrying iPad. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Channel inventory increased by about 525,000 units from the beginning to the end of the quarter to support increased sales and channel expansion, and we ended the quarter within our target range of four to six weeks. Combining iPhone, iPad and iPod touch, we reached over 160 million cumulative iOS device sales through the end of the December quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In November, we launched iOS 4.2, which brings over 100 new features to iPad users including multitasking, folders, unified inbox, Game Center, AirPlay and AirPrint. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">The App Store continues to be incredibly successful, with over 300,000 apps available and well over 9 billion downloads to date. We continue to be very pleased with iAd, which combines the narrative quality of TV ads with the interactivity of digital to provide a new kind of advertising experience.  During the quarter, we expanded iAds beyond the U.S. to Europe and Japan and provided iAd Producer to marketers. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">I'd now like to turn to the Apple Retail Stores, which had a record-breaking quarter. Retail revenue almost doubled year-over-year to $3.85 billion compared to $1.97 billion in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 95%. iPad sales in our stores were very strong in the first holiday quarter. The stores also delivered a record Mac quarter, selling 851,000 Macs compared to 689,000 Macs in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 24%. And about half the Macs sold in our stores during the December quarter were to customers who had never owned a Mac before. International Retail Store sales were particularly strong with our average international store volume exceeding our very productive average U.S. store volume. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Additionally, our four stores in China were, on average, our highest traffic and our highest revenue stores in the world. We opened six stores during the December quarter, bringing us to a total of 323 stores worldwide at the quarter end, with 87 of them outside the United States. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">With an average of 321 stores opened during the December quarter, average revenue per store was $12 million compared to $7.1 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 69%. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Retail segment margin exceeded $1 billion for the first time and more than doubled from $481 million in the year-ago quarter. We hosted a record 75.7 million visitors in our stores during the quarter, compared to 50.9 million visitors in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 49%. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Total company gross margin was 38.5%, which was about 250 basis points higher than our guidance. About half this difference was due to better commodity cost than we had planned. The remainder of the difference was due to the leverage on the higher revenue and lower other product costs, including freight, warranty and phone support. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Operating expenses were $2.47 billion and included $247 million in stock-based compensation expense. OI&amp;E was $136 million, ahead of our guidance primarily due to the positive impact of fluctuating foreign exchange rates from net asset. The tax rate for the quarter was 24.6%, below our guidance of 25.5% due to the one-time benefit of the retroactive extension of the R&amp;D tax credit from January 1, 2010. We expect our tax rate for the remaining quarters of fiscal '11 to be about 25.5%. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to cash. Our cash, plus short-term and long-term marketable securities, totaled $59.7 billion at the end of the December quarter, compared to $51 billion at the end of the September quarter, an increase of $8.7 billion. Cash flow from operations was $9.8 billion, an increase of 69% year-over-year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">During the September and December quarters, we executed long-term supply agreements with three vendors through which we expect to spend a total of approximately $3.9 billion in inventory component prepayments and capital expenditures over a two-year period. We made approximately $650 million in payments under these agreements in the December quarter, and anticipate making $1.05 billion in payments in the March quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be about $22 billion, compared to $13.5 billion in the March quarter last year. We expect gross margins to be about 38.5%, reflecting approximately $50 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be about $2.35 billion, including about $250 million related to stock-based compensation. We expect OI&amp;E to be about $50 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 25.5%. We are targeting EPS of about $4.90. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In closing, we're extremely pleased with our record-breaking results and customer response to our products. We look forward to expanding the reach of the iPhone in the United States with the addition of Verizon, and we remain very confident in our strategy and our new product pipeline. And with that, I'd like to open the call to questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Thank you, Peter. Also joining us for Q&amp;A are Apple COO, Tim Cook; and Treasurer, Gary Wipfler. And we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Operator, may we have the first question please?</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p4\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">[Operator Instructions] And your next question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Shannon Cross - Cross Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">I have a question for you with regard to availability of iPhones, especially with the Verizon launch. I think you mentioned that there was a backlog that you weren't able to meet in the December quarter. So I don't know if, Tim and Peter, if you could talk a little bit about what you're doing to ensure that you have sufficient quantities of iPhones and any changes you've made to ensure more component availability?</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Shannon, it's Tim. As I mentioned on the last quarter's call, we made a very bold bet, taking iPhone capacity for the September quarter with the new iPhone 4 in the lineup to 14 million. And as you may remember, we sold over 14 million in that quarter in total iPhones, so it was a fantastic quarter. And that was up from a previous number that with the 8-ish million range. We were able to step that up in this past quarter to over 16 million, as Peter said in his opening remarks. And so we were able to increase over 2 million. And we\u2019re, obviously, have continued to work on increasing this further. But as with all good things, it takes some time to do that. Relative to Verizon, we are thrilled to offer the iPhone 4 to Verizon with 93 million customers, as well as any new customers who want an iPhone 4 on Verizon. And we're going to do everything possible to get the iPhones into as many hands of those customers as possible.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Shannon Cross - Cross Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">And then I just had one follow up, with regard to the Mac App Store, which clearly just started, though I'm not sure how much you'll talk about it. But we've noticed your best-selling apps tend to be Apple software-based, Apple software apps. So how should we think about the Mac App Store? Any initial thoughts you have on it and initial things you've seen?</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">It's just getting going, but we are thrilled to have reported over 1 million in a very short amount of time. And so we're very happy with the start of it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">And next, we'll go to Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Kathryn Huberty - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">First question for Tim, how comfortable are you right now with the availability of iPhones and iPads? And if you still see shortages, how quickly do you think they can be addressed early this year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Katy, let me take each one of those separately. On iPad, we increased dramatically last quarter. We sold 7.3 million the previous quarter, we were in the low 4s as you know. That did get us into supply-demand balance and also allowed us to expand to 46 countries, or to a total of 46 by the end of the quarter, which added 20 during the quarter. And we're confident enough to add another 15 countries during the month of January that will take us over 60. And so we feel very, very good about the progress that we've made here. Relative to iPhone 4, I also feel very, very good about what we've been able to do. However, it's not enough. We do still have a significant backlog. We are working around-the-clock to build more. I feel great that the demand is so high, but at this point, I'm not going to predict when supply and demand will meet. We believe the reaction and results from the Verizon customers will be huge, and so I don't want to give a prediction right now when the supply and demand will cross.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Kathryn Huberty - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">And then Tim, one of the most impressive metrics is the sequential on your growth of Asia-Pacific. Can you just talk about what's driving that and what plans you have in place, going forward, to sustain that growth?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Yes. That's a very good question. First of all, let me say that of the BRIC countries, Brazil, Russia, India, China, we, several years ago, identified China as our top priority, and we put enormous energy into China. And the results of that has been absolutely staggering. To give you some numbers there and some specifics, we look at Greater China as a region. And Greater China, just for clarity, is mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The revenue from Greater China for Apple for last quarter was $2.6 billion, which was up 4x from the prior year quarter. And to further, just an exclamation point by that, we did a little over $3 billion for the entire year, fiscal year 2010. And so we're very, very proud of the team and the results that we've gotten there. Korea has also been a very, very good market for us. We had an outstanding Q1 there, primarily driven by iPhone and iPads. And there are several other Asian countries doing extremely well. Japan is not in the segment that you're looking out, but Japan by itself, the revenue was up 83% year-over-year. And if you're familiar with the Japanese economy and the growth there, to grow 83% on the base that we're doing is stunning. And so we are placing more and more resource in these areas and continue to look for expansion possibilities throughout Asia.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">From Piper Jaffray, we'll hear from Gene Munster.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Charles Munster - Piper Jaffray Companies</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Question for Tim in terms of the long-term business planning. There's been a lot of questions in terms of how far out you guys actually planned it. I was wondering if there's any insight you can give us in terms of what your long-term business plan is in terms of a product road map. Obviously, you can't share what that road map is. But how far will you guys go in Retail Stores and so forth? Is it a one-year plan, is it a five-year plan, is it -- any sort of insight would be helpful?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Well, Gene, that's part of the magic of Apple. And I don't want to let anybody know our magic because I don't want anybody copying it. What I would tell you is that in my view, Apple is doing its best work ever, that we are all very happy with the product pipeline. And the team here has an unparalleled breadth and depth of talent and a culture of innovation that Steve has driven in the company, and excellence has become a habit. And so we feel very, very confident about the future of the company. I would also note to those people that haven't thought about it is we've done outstanding in our Mac business. We've had 19 quarters straight of growing faster than the market, but we still have a relatively low share of a very large PC market despite having great momentum there. And so it would seem like there's enormous opportunity still there. We have a relatively low share in the handset market. The handset market is well over 1 billion units a year, and the smartphone market is growing faster than a weed. And so there's enormous opportunity here, and we have incredible momentum in that space. iPad just got started, it's a new category. We sold almost 15 million through the first three quarters, and we believe the market is huge. IDC, I saw this morning, is predicting it to quadruple in two years. I don't know what to predict in terms of specific numbers. However, we believe it's a huge market, as we've said before. And so we're in some great markets, some fast-moving markets, we have the best products we've ever done and an incredible product pipeline. We feel very, very confident.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Charles Munster - Piper Jaffray Companies</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">And just a follow-up for Peter, in terms of iPhones, you mentioned that if not for production constraints, you could've sold more. Is there any way to help us kind of back into how many more?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Gene, you can't run the experiment both ways, that's -- the demand for iPhone has just been incredible. We could not make enough in the quarter, and we would've loved to have ended with more channel inventory than we did.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">From Citigroup, we'll hear from Richard Gardner.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Richard Gardner - Citigroup Inc</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">I was just hoping that you could talk about what components were better than you thought in terms of price during the quarter? And then Tim, if you could give us your thoughts on the commodity environment going into the March quarter, given that flat panels are below cash costs for some providers. What are you looking for going into the March quarter, please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Rich, in terms of the go-forward in March quarter and what is embedded in the guidance that Peter gave earlier is that we expect a favorable pricing environment for DRAM, where supply exceeds the demand still. Some prices for raw materials such as key metals is currently increasing due to the anticipated strengthening of the worldwide economy, and it remains to be seen whether that continues. The bulk of the other commodities from NAND Flash to batteries to HDDs to ODDs to LCDs and most other commodities are generally in a supply-demand balance. And so we would expect this group of commodities to fall in prices consistent with their historical trends. In terms of what we saw last quarter, frankly speaking, in most areas, we saw a favorability and it was a key part of us overachieving our guidance gross margin.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Richard Gardner - Citigroup Inc</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">And actually, Tim, if I could follow up, can you talk about which component areas you're making long-term commitments in on supply?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">It's something I don't want to give out, Rich, because I view it as a competitive -- something I just don't want our competition knowing. But let me talk about it in general and hopefully, that will suffice. From our point of view on the design side, we design components where we believe we can innovate beyond what's available in the market. And the most recent example of this is the A4 chip. But with the A4 chip, we didn't feel like we had to invest in the fab itself and build the fab because we felt like they were good options in the market for doing that, but not good options in terms of buying a design, and so we really focused on design. On the operational side of the house, as you probably remember, we've historically entered into certain agreements with different people to secure supply and other benefits. And the largest one in the recent past has been we signed a deal with several Flash suppliers back at the end of 2005 that totaled over $1 billion because we anticipated that Flash would become increasingly important across our entire product line and increasingly important to the industry. And so we wanted to secure supply for the company, and we think that, that was an absolutely fantastic use of Apple's cash. And we constantly look for more of these. And so in the past several quarters we've identified another area and come to some recent agreements that Peter talked about in his opening comments, in that these payments consist of both prepayments and capital for process equipment and tooling. And similar to the Flash agreements, they're focused in an area we feel is very strategic. And so I'd prefer not to go into more detail about what specific area it's in, but it's the same kind of thinking that led us to those deals that led us to the Flash deal.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">From Goldman Sachs, we'll hear from Bill Shope.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Bill Shope - J.P. Morgan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Guys, in the past, your build materials for key devices has generally come down at a rate that allowed for fairly healthy gross margin expansion over time. And I'd say this has generally been true for iPod refreshes in the past, iPhone refreshes. Is there anything different about the iPad that we should consider going forward, that would make it difficult for margins to follow this historical pattern? And did you see some of this in the most recent quarter as well?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Bill, margins consist of a number different factors like which direction the commodity markets are going? Where the product is within the product life cycle, as well as the value engineering that we do and the negotiating and so forth we do. And so I don't think that you can take a single product kind of out by itself and speak about it with any accuracy. And as you know, we don't guide at the product level on  margin. We're confident with the guidance that Peter provided on gross margin in his opening comments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And I would ask of that, that we have always aggressively worked to lower our costs. I think we have a good track record in this regard, and we shipped a lot of iPads in the December quarter, and have very strong gross margins. So I think we were quite happy with our progress.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Bill Shope - J.P. Morgan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">On the iPad side again. Now that you've had the opportunity over the past few weeks to see more detail specs and in some cases, the price points for all the countless tablet devices coming into 2011. Can you comment on how you're currently dealing with competitive landscape for the iPad and how, if that's changed, if at all, over the past few months?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Well, and if you're look at what's shipping today, there's not much out there as you know. And generally speaking, there's two kinds of groups today, that are at least on the market today. The ones that are using a Windows-based operating system are generally fairly big and heavy and expensive. They have very weak battery life, they require a keyboard or a stylus as an input device. And from our point of view and what we've seen, customers, frankly, just are not interested in them. Then you have the Android tablet, and the variety that are out shipping today, the operating system wasn't really designed for a tablet. And Google has said this, and so this is not just an Apple view by any means. And so you wind up having a size of a tablet that is less than what we believe is reasonable or even one that would provide what we feel is a real tablet experience. And so basically, you wind up with kind of a scaled-up smartphone, which is a bizarre product in our view. Then you've got kind of a third group -- and so those are the two that are shipping today. And frankly speaking, it's hard for me to understand if somebody does a side-by-side with an iPad, I think some enormous percentage of people are going to select an iPad there. Those are not tablets that we have any concern on. The next-generation Android tablets, which are primarily what you mentioned in terms of the CES, there's nothing shipping yet, and so I don't know. Generally, they lack performance specs, they lack prices, they lack timing. And so today, they're vapor. We'll assess them as they come out. However, we're not sitting still. And we have a huge first-mover advantage. And we have an incredible user experience from iTunes to the App Store, and an enormous number of apps and a huge ecosystem. And so we're very, very confident with entering into a fight with anyone.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">From Sanford Bernstein, we'll hear from Toni Sacconaghi.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Toni Sacconaghi - Bernstein Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">You've said on previous earnings calls that the move to iPhone non-exclusivity in regions of the world has had no impact on your ASPs. Can you comment on whether that is it still the case today and whether we should expect any impact in the migration away from U.S. exclusivity? And related to that, there are several large carriers globally that the iPhone is still not offered in. Can you talk about some of the reasons why that isn't the case? Many of them are CDMA-based. And given that you now have a CDMA-based offering, is it unreasonable to expect that we should see more CDMA carriers going forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Toni, it's Tim. Relative to the ASP, I generally would not do this. And I want to be specific, that this comment isn't related to the U.S. or any specific carrier or any specific region. But to specifically answer your question, I don't envision the overall iPhone ASP decreasing from the December quarter that we just completed to the March quarter that we're currently in. And as you know, as our long-standing practice has been, we don't comment on after, after that period of time. Relative to other carriers, yes, we're always looking and assessing in every country who we should be doing business with and exploring different deals and arrangements, et cetera. And so we'll continue to do that. What I've said before and we have seen this in every case, literally, that we've done, is where we've moved from a exclusive carrier arrangement to a dual- or multi-carrier arrangement, our growth has changed significantly and our market share has increased. And so that doesn't mean that would happen in every country nor does it mean that we're just out doing that in every country. We look at each one individual because each market has its own individual characteristics and parameters and technology. On the CDMA phone, specifically, I don't have any specific thing to announce today other than we're truly thrilled to be working with the Verizon team. They have built quite a company and earned a great deal of respect from the customers, and some of them have waited a long time to get iPhone. And we're very, very happy to give them iPhone, and any other customers that are non-Verizon customers who wish to buy an iPhone. We're also very happy that we've signed a multi-year non-inclusive deal with AT&amp;T. And so we're very happy that we'll have shortly a dual-carrier setup in the United States.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Toni Sacconaghi - Bernstein Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Tim, if I could follow-up on that, given your previous comments on China and the importance of that country strategically for you and the investments that you're making in stores, et cetera, can you may be use that as a case study for why you're only in one carrier there? I think you've said that there are no longer any exclusive conditions that you have in place globally with any carriers. So can you talk about other either impediments or hindrances beyond technology, of which CDMA is one, that may be limiting your ability to sign important carrier agreements in potentially very important and strategic areas for the company?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Toni, I generally found people really want to do business with us, and their customers are very much desiring to have the iPhone. And so I don't really see a lack of desire. I don't want to comment about any specific country because I view any conversations that we have going confidential in nature. It is true, as you said, that we are not under a contractual exclusivity now in any country in the world. The last one was the United States. We have moved away from those. I can guarantee you that we always are looking at opportunities to grow. Of course, in the very short-term, I would also remind you that we're constrained on iPhone 4, and we're working around the clock to get as many of these out to our existing partners as we can.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">We'll go to Brian Blair with Wedge Partners.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Brian Blair - Wedge Partners</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Can you maybe give us your updated thoughts on the Mac side and maybe specifically address the impact of iPads? With the tremendous iPad unit this quarter, the cannibalization question is going to come up. And I just want to get your latest thoughts on that, if we could?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">That's a good question. What we saw in the Mac this quarter was we grew 23% at the worldwide level, and that is compared to a market growth of only 3%. And so we grew almost 8x the market rate of growth, which is, I think, stunning. And every region outgrew the market, so it wasn't just one region. Asia-Pacific led the growth with a whopping 67% year-over-year increase, and that's almost 10x what market did there, to put it in context. Japan grew at 56%, which is about 6x the market, and Europe and the United States both grew in double-digits despite both markets contracting overall. And so we did significantly better than the market in every major region, and we're very proud of that. Now was there any cannibalization by iPad? Honestly, I don't know for sure. But yes, I think there is some cannibalization. But I also think there's a halo effect. As we've seen on the Mac by the iPod some years ago, I think there is a halo effect from Apple product to Apple product. And of course, we have introduced millions of people in Asia to Apple through the iPhone. And we're now introducing many more through the iPad, and I think some of those decide to buy a Mac. And so when you look at the Mac growth in Asia at 67%, and you look at the Japan growth at 56%, and you look at the U.S. and Europe growing in double-digits against shrinking markets, if this is cannibalization, it feels pretty good. The other point I would make is that if the iPad or tablets do cannibalize the PC market, keep in mind that we have low share of the PC market. And so the other guys lose a lot more, and we have a lot more to win because of that. And so honestly, cannibalization is not something that we are spending one minute on here. The iPad team are building the best iPad for the future, and the Mac teams are building the best Mac, and I can tell you that both groups believe that they can continue to grow and do great stuff, and I believe that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Brian Blair - Wedge Partners</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And that's a great way to look at it. One of the things that's interesting to me is I see this trend of your bringing a lot more of the functionality from the tablet side, you're bringing it on to the Mac side. It was talked about earlier, the Mac App Store that's now on Mac OS X. And then as we're getting kind of teaser shots of Lion, it looks like the next OS is also taking even more kind of design and UI elements from the iPad side. So maybe if you could just talk about that a little bit, are these two platforms really merging into one? And is this the future of computing as you see it? Or is it just -- are you just kind of grabbing one or two aspects of tablets and bringing it into the OS X?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I think one of the -- part of the magic of Apple is that there's not high walls between these product groups. They like each other, talk to each other, they're of the same DNA, they want to build the best products in the world. And so if one has a great idea, there's not a \"not invented here\" in the other group. And so one of the key learnings from the iPad was that people love instant on, they really love that. And so the MacBook Air incorporated that, and that's just one simple example. But there are tons of examples throughout all of our products, where something started on one and went to a different one. And it's not always in the same direction either. It could start on the phone, and then flow forward, it could start on the iPad and flow, and so on and so forth. And so just the part of the way we run the company. And I think Steve said it great when he said, \"If the Mac company were a separate company, and the iPad company were a separate company, what would the Mac company build to compete with the iPad? And I think the answer is the MacBook Air.\" And I think that's a phenomenal insight, and I think a great way to look at it. And it's not that the groups are competing, they are sharing and coming up with these incredible products that people really want.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">From Bank of Montreal, we'll hear from Keith Bachman.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Tim, do you have data that you've gathered on the Phone and/or the iPad on new to the brand. You typically talk about Macs in the stores, you're getting 50% new to the brand. Do you have any data related to the newness of the brand? I would assume it's substantially higher to that, but I want to hear a little bit about that. And depending on that outcome, if you talk a little bit about how you think these products, in particular, the Pad in emerging markets may help to continue drive share opportunities for you?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I don't want to share -- do we collect it? Yes, of course, we do. The numbers for iPhone are -- there's many such numbers, they're now big because we've been shipping iPhones for a while. Any product that you ship for a while looks a little different at the prime end or in the early adopter cycle versus when you get to the mainstream. The iPad went through that cycle quickly, and moved to mainstream and enterprise and all the rest in record time. But nevertheless, that data needs to settle some, even before internally, we put a lot of weight in it. But the bulk of your question doesn't need specific numbers. To make a point, if you look at our Asia-Pacific business, the revenue growth was 175% or so. And so this is incredible. And the size of business in Asia that we've now built is massive. To do $2.6 billion in China in three months, where just two years ago, we did less than $1 billion in the whole year, it is phenomenal, or actually for the year before. And so I think we are -- it's clear that we're introducing a lot of people to Apple who previously had not been introduced to the company, and I think that helps across the product line.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">In the U.S., I'm just trying to understand how you see the tablet market more broadly having greater penetration rates, say in established markets versus emerging markets. But typically, the notion is that tablets in many cases are more about consumption versus creation. And just want to hear your thoughts, not on growth rate, but on absolute unit opportunities between the established markets and the emerging markets?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I think that the tablet market is, the opportunity is so large, it's large everywhere, honestly. I think it\u2019s huge.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And we'll move on to Barclays Capital, Ben Reitzes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Benjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">A question for Peter, I just wanted to cash out the revenue outlook. Your sequential decline of, I guess, 17% is a little more than last year's, but you have Verizon now for the iPhone. So what components, I guess, other than iPod, are expected to have to contribute to the big decline, if intuitively, maybe iPhone has some support from Verizon?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Ben, I'll answer your question in a couple of ways. First of all, we're working hard to increase supply of iPhones. Tim has talked about that, but that will come over a period of time and not necessarily, overnight, as we said. In terms of the sequential guidance this year, let me start by saying we are thrilled to be giving you guidance for 63% revenue growth year-over-year, which will translate to a 50% earnings growth. So the business is performing extremely well. We're shipping the best products in Apple history and customer response has been tremendous. But as I said in my prepared remarks, we increased the iPhone and the iPad channel inventory by about 775,000 units, and this will have a bit of impact on the sequential compare that you referred to. In terms of the products, for Mac, we've just reported the highest Mac sales ever, and we've outgrown the market for 19 consecutive quarters. We would expect to see a sequential unit decline, which is typical for us after the holiday season. For iPod, we would also expect to see a large sequential decline, which is also typical for us after the holiday season. For iPhone, we'd expect to see a significant year-over-year increase. And for iPad, this will be our first experience, going from the December to March quarter, so we'll see. However, it was clear to us that the iPad was a hot holiday gift item, which fueled the 75% sequential growth that we saw in the December quarter. And given this, we would expect a sequential decline in the March quarter. So that's what's gone into our thinking, Ben.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Benjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And then just a follow up for Tim, the last call, maybe, or one of the last calls, Steve had a lot of comments around Android and perhaps, some of its disadvantages versus your platform. Is there any other observations you'd like to make now that, we had a few more months, to see the market develop further and with Verizon, and even more tablet sales on the horizon, feedback you're getting from developers, or anything else you'd like to add on the battle with Android, kind of updating Steve's recent comments from last quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Well, if you look at the iPhone portion, we had record sales on iPhone with 16.2 million units sold in the quarter. And Peter said we believe we could've sold more if we had more supply. From the market estimates that we've seen, it suggests that we grew faster than the market. Obviously, we're working around the clock on increasing supply. We're continuing to expand countries and carriers. And I've talked a little bit of that with Toni's question. We're getting enormous enterprise traction, with 88% of the Fortune 100, which is mind-blowing, I believe. 83% of the Fortune 500, 60% of the FT 100. So the enterprise traction is gaining. We have the highest customer sat [satisfaction] ratings in the industry versus Android or RIM or any -- we have the largest App Store with over 300,000 apps. We have now sold over 160 million iOS devices. And I mean, this is huge. And we fundamentally believe that our integrated approach delivers a far superior customer experience than the fragmented approach. And you can see this in a variety of ways from the fragmentation of the number of App Stores out there that people are going to pull their hair out, because they're going to have a variety of updating methodologies, and a variety of payment methods, and slightly different derivatives. You can see from surveys, people are doing to see who is on the latest OS, and you'll notice that the iOS is always off the charts on the percentage of people that have the latest version versus the other guys. We are launching with Verizon next month. We believe there's a huge pent-up demand there, and we think that, that will help us in the U.S. And so I think I'd probably just repeat it, much of what he said before. But the net-net is we think that our integrated approach is much better for the end user because it takes out all the complexity for the end user instead of making the end user a systems integrator themselves. I don't know about you, but I don't know very many people that want to be system integrators as a consumer or somebody in the enterprise. And so I think that the more iPhones that we can get out there into people's hands, the more people love them. And I think we've got a very bright future. I think the same thing about iPad. It's the same set of issues at the end of the day. The differences on iPad, of course, is that we have a -- we've been running three quarters without any significant competition of any type. And I think that the customer sat ratings on the iPad are also off the charts. So I don't know if any of that is new, I doubt that it is. But I think we're in a very good position.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">We'll go to Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Mark Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Peter, I want to see if you can give us a little more insight on the iPad gross margins going forward. Just given Tim's comments earlier about the bounty of underachievers out there, at least, nearly going, should we assume then that Apple can really improve the future set with the next generation and kind of hold pricing stable?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I'm sorry, Mark, that's not a question I can answer. We don't talk about future products. But I can tell you that in terms of what we're shipping today, we're always aggressively working to lower our costs. And I think we have a good track record in doing so, and our gross margins were stronger than we thought for the December quarter. And I've provided guidance for the March quarter at 38.5%. And we feel very, very good about the performance of our products and our cost of products.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Mark Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And then my follow-up, Tim, I apologize if this question has been asked, I fell off for a moment, I want to come back to the MacBook Air. Just given the initial success here and momentum, can you give us any sort of insight in terms of how you're looking at that platform now? Is it kind of a premium tablet? Is this kind of more of a notebook still? I trying to get a sense of just kind of a one-two punch in terms of the iPad, with the MacBook Air, kind of giving you a kind of a double coverage, if you will, in both notebooks and tablets?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">The way that we look at it is it's the Mac of the future shipping today, and it was a phenomenal part of our growth on the Mac last quarter. It has gotten off to a unbelievable start. The customers love it. They love the precision of it, they love the thinness, the weight, the instant on and the list is long, I think. And so we're really happy with how it's doing out of the starting blocks. And as you know, we've only been shipping it for less than 90 days, and so we've just gotten going.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">We'll go to Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Jason Maynard - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">There's been a lot of talk about this consumerization of enterprise technology, and obviously, it's being driven by folks bringing their iPhones and iPads to work. I know you said it's some big share gains within your statistics. But I was curious if you think there still are some barriers around maybe developer training at the corporate level or security or things that just sort of naturally need to get worked through before you start to see those penetration numbers even increase further or start to see a wider swathe of employees use iPhones and iPads in business?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I think that the consumerization that you speak of, of the enterprise, is one of the megatrends that are occurring. I think the most forward-looking CIOs are coming to the realization that the productivity of the person, the creativity of the employees is materially more important than everyone using the same thing. And the ability to write apps in a simple and straightforward manner for the iPhone or the iPad through the SDK is an incredible thing. And you can wind up, literally, running your whole business off of an iPad or an iPhone. And so I think the list of ideas and places that people can go there are -- were unimaginable just a few months ago. And so I see an enormous potential there. The numbers are already incredible. And think about this, the iPad started shipping in April, and we're already up to 80% of the largest companies deploying or piloting the product. This is unheard of, at least, in my dealings with the enterprise over the years. Generally, enterprise is much slower and much more cautious and uses things that have been in the market for a long time. And I think to everyone's credit, they've seen the value of this from a productivity and creativity point of view, and they're really moving fast. And so I think we're just scratching the surface right now. In terms of inhibitors, the iPad has a huge advantage because as you probably remember, as we went to various different iOS releases, we always put in a huge chunk of enterprise features. And so this isn't something that we just started focusing on. We started focusing on this before we shipped the first phone. And with the synergy that exists with the iOS between the different products, other products get the advantage of it, not just the product that it ships on initially. And so I think there's a huge play here for us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks, as a podcast on the iTunes Store, as a webcast on apple.com/investor and via telephone.

Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2011 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would now turn the call over to Ms. Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Speaking today is Apple CFO, Peter Oppenheimer; and he'll be joined by Apple COO, Tim Cook; and Treasurer, Gary Wipfler, for the Q&amp;A session with the analysts. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margins, operating expenses, other income and expense, stock-based compensation expense, taxes, earnings per share and future products.

Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information which speak as of their respective date. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Apple CFO, Peter Oppenheimer, for introductory remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you, Nancy. Thank you for joining us. We are very pleased to report the highest March quarter revenue and earnings in Apple's history. We set a new all-time quarterly record for iPhone sales, and a new March quarter record for Mac sales, and we're thrilled with the momentum for iPad. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Revenue for the quarter was $24.7 billion, which was $11.2 billion over the prior March quarter's result and represents the largest year-over-year quarterly revenue growth we've ever generated. This tremendous increase of 83% was fueled primarily by record iPhone sales, very robust demand for iPad and strong growth in Mac sales. Operating margin was an all-time high of almost $7.9 billion, representing 31.9% of revenue. Net income was almost $6 billion. This represented 95% growth over the year gross quarter's earnings and translated to earnings per share of $6.40. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Turning to the details of the quarter. I'd like to begin with our Mac products and services. We established a new March quarter record with sales of 3.76 million Macs, representing 28% growth over the year ago quarter. We're extremely pleased with this very strong growth, particularly given IDC's most recently published estimate of a 3% contraction for the PC market overall. This result makes the March quarter the 20th consecutive quarter that we outperformed the PC market. We experienced strong Mac sales growth in each of our operating segments, most notably in the Asia-Pacific segment, where Mac sales increased 76% year-over-year. The growth in Mac sales was fueled primarily by the continued great popularity of MacBook Air, which was updated in the December quarter, as well as very strong sales of MacBook Pro. We updated the entire MacBook Pro family during the March quarter with the next-generation processors and graphics, high-speed Thunderbolt I/O technology and a new FaceTime HD camera. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">The new MacBook Pro lineup offers twice the speed of the previous generation and customer response has been excellent. We began at the end of the quarter with between 3 and 4 weeks of Mac channel inventory. During the quarter, we released the developer preview of Mac OS X Lion, which takes some of the best ideas from the iPad and brings them back to the Mac. Lion features Mission Control an innovative new view of everything running on the Mac. Launchpad, a new home for all your Mac Apps, full screen apps that use the entire Mac display and new multi-touch gestures. Lion is scheduled to ship to customers this summer and we look forward to showing more of its great features at our Developers Conference in June. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Moving to our music products. We sold 9 million iPods compared to 10.9 million in the year ago quarter. Though lower year-over-year, total iPod sales were ahead of our expectations with iPod touch continuing to count for over half of all iPods sold. iPod share of the U.S. market for MP3 players remains at over 70% based on the latest monthly data published by MPD, and iPod continue to be the top-selling MP3 player in most countries we track based on the latest data published by GFK. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We ended the quarter within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPod channel inventory. The iTunes Store turned in its best quarter ever with revenue of almost $1.4 billion, thanks to record revenue from music, video, iOS apps and books. We were very pleased to begin offering a full catalog of 17,000 ebooks from Random House on the iBookstore during the March quarter. The iBookstore now includes ebooks for more than 2,500 publishers in over 20 categories, and customers have downloaded over 100 million books. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">I'd now like to turn to the iPhone. We were thrilled to have sold a record 18.6 million iPhones compared to 8.8 million in the previous March quarter. This represents 113% year-over-year growth which is significantly ahead of IDC's latest published estimate of 74% growth for the global smartphone market overall in the March quarter. Recognized revenue from iPhone handset and accessory sales was $12.3 billion during the quarter compared to $5.45 billion in the year ago quarter, an increase of 126%. We continue to experience very strong year-over-year iPhone sales growth in all of our operating segments with sales in both the Americas and Asia-Pacific regions more than doubling year-over-year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We were able to make a significant increase in our capacity, once again, allowing us to expand distribution and get much-needed supply to our channel partners. We were very pleased to begin selling iPhones on the Verizon network in the U.S. in the March quarter, and we were also happy to add SK Telecom in Korea, as well as Saudi Telecom in Saudi Arabia. Including some carrier consolidation, we ended the quarter with iPhone distribution through 186 carriers in 90 countries. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We ended the quarter with about 5.2 million iPhones in channel inventory, a sequential increase of about 1.7 million to support new carrier launches and existing channel partners. This placed us within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPhone channel inventory. iPhone is continuing to see strong growth within the Enterprise segment. Today, 88% of the Fortune 500 are testing or deploying iPhone. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">With strong employee demand and custom app development fueling adoption, we are seeing great scale of iPhone deployments in businesses worldwide. In fact, hundreds of private and public companies worldwide are supporting thousands of iPhones on their corporate networks. Some examples include Cisco, Prudential, Boston Scientific, General Motors, American Airlines, Deloitte, Yum! Brands and Xerox. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Turning to iPad, we continue to be thrilled with its momentum. We sold 4.7 million iPads during the March quarter, launching iPad 2 in U.S. on March 11 and in 25 additional countries on March 25. Customer enthusiasm has been tremendous for iPad 2 and we're working hard to get it into the hands of customers as quickly as possible. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Including both the original iPad and iPad 2, we had distribution in 59 countries by the end of the March quarter. Given the very strong customer demand and despite the increased geographic distribution, iPod (sic) [iPad] channel inventory declined by 400,000 from the beginning of the quarter, implying sell-through of about 5.1 million. This resulted in ending channel inventory of below 850,000, which was below our target range of 4 to 6 weeks. We sold every iPad 2 that we could make during the quarter and would have liked to end the quarter with more channel inventory. Recognized revenue from sales of iPad and iPad accessories during the quarter was $2.8 billion. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Employee demand for iPad in the corporate environment remains strong and CIOs continue to embrace iPad in an unprecedented rate. In just over a year since its debut, 75% of the Fortune 500 are testing or deploying iPad within their enterprises. Some recent examples of enterprises that are deploying iPad include FORTUNE 500 companies such as Xerox, AutoNation, Yum! Brands, ADP, Boston Scientific, Est\u00e9e Lauder, Disney, Stryker, Prudential Financial, Rite Aid and USAA. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Combining iPhone, iPad and iPod touch, we reached just under 189 million cumulative iOS device sales through the end of the March quarter. In March, we introduced iOS 4.3 with new features including faster Safari mobile browsing performance with the Java Nitro script engine, iTunes Home Sharing, enhancements to AirPlay and the Personal Hotspot feature for sharing an iPhone 4 cellular data connection over Wi-Fi. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">The App Store continues to be incredibly successful with over 350,000 apps available and well over 10 billion downloads to date. In February, we announced a new subscription service available to all publishers of content-based apps, including magazines, newspapers, video and music. Publishers set the price and length of subscription and customers select the subscription and length they want with 1 click. And it was also a great pleasure to announce in March that we have made more than $2 billion in payments to developers since opening the App Store. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">I'd now like to turn to the Apple Retail Stores. We are approaching the Retail Stores 10th anniversary on May 19, and we're on the verge of achieving a major milestone. In the next few days, we will be thrilled to welcome our 1 billionth visitor. Store traffic continues to be amazingly strong. And in the March quarter, we hosted a record 71.1 million visitors in our stores compared to 47 million visitors in the year ago quarter, an increase of 51%. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Retail revenue was $3.19 billion compared to $1.68 billion in the year ago quarter, an increase of 90%. Capitalizing on the February MacBook Pro update, the stores delivered another record Mac quarter, selling 797,000 Macs compared to 606,000 Macs in the year ago quarter, an increase of 32%, and about half the Macs sold in our stores during the March quarter were to customers who had never owned a Mac before. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">To further enrich our Apple retail customer experience, we recently launched a program called Personal Setup. When customers buy a Mac, iPad, iPhone or iPod touch, our teams help the customer set up the product in the store so that they are up and running before they leave. Personal Setup includes the customer's e-mail, contacts, calendar, applications and more. In the March quarter, our stores set up over 1 million products. We operated 323 stores during the quarter. Average revenue per store was $9.9 million compared to $5.9 million in the year ago quarter, an increase of 67%. International retail store sales remain strong with our average international store volume exceeding our very productive average U.S. store volume. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Retail segment margin more than doubled year-over-year to $807 million compared to $373 million in the year ago quarter. We anticipate opening 40 new stores in fiscal 2011, nearly 3 quarters of which will be outside the United States, including our fifth store in China. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Total company gross margin was 41.4%, which was 290 basis points higher than our guidance. More than half of this difference came from better product mix than planned, particularly higher iPhone sales. The remainder was largely a result of leverage on the higher revenue and lower-than-expected commodity, service and other costs. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Operating expenses were $2.34 billion and included $236 million of stock-based compensation expense. OI&amp;E was $26 million and the tax rate for the quarter was 24.2%, below our guidance of 25.5% due to changes in our full year forecast of foreign earnings, R&amp;D tax credit and state taxes. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to cash. Our cash for short-term and long-term marketable securities totaled $65.8 billion at the end of the March quarter compared to $59.7 billion at the end of the December quarter, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion. Cash flow from operations was $6.2 billion, an increase of 167% year-over-year. The increase in cash is net of approximately $900 million to combine prepayments and capital expenditures related to the strategic supply agreements that we referred to in our last quarterly call. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As we move into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be about $23 billion compared to $15.7 billion in the June quarter last year. We expect gross margin to be about 38%, reflecting approximately $55 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be about $2.5 billion, including about $255 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OI&amp;E to be about $70 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 25%. We are targeting EPS of about $5.03. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In closing, we're thrilled with the results and accomplishments of our record March quarter. We're extremely pleased with customers' response to iPad 2 and are working hard to get it into the hands of customers as fast as we can. We remain very confident in our strategy and are very excited about our new product pipeline. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">And with that, I'd like to open the call to questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Thank you, Peter. We ask that you limit yourself to 1 question and 1 follow-up. Operator, may we have the first question, please?</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p4\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">[Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Okay, great. Thanks. Can you comment, Peter, on whether or not you're seeing any supply chain disruptions from the recent earthquake in Japan. And if so, how should we think about that in terms of that being factored in your guidance?</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Bill, this is Tim. Let me sort of step back and talk about Japan in general and sort of try to get all of your questions in advance. First of all, this is an incredible tragedy and our hearts go out to everyone involved. Apple, as a company, has a very long history and has many strong ties to people in Japan, and we're very, very saddened by the situation, and we've undertaken various actions to assist in the relief effort. The economic impact that we'll address today pales in comparison to the human impact. Regarding our business in Japan, we had some revenue impact in Q2 but it was not material to Apple's consolidated results. We believe revenues will be approximately $200 million less in Q3, and this has been factored into the guidance that Peter provided you earlier in his comments. Regarding our global supply chain, as a result of outstanding teamwork and unprecedented resilience of our partners, we did not have any supply or cost impact in our fiscal Q2 as a result of the tragedy, and we currently do not anticipate any material supply or cost impact in our fiscal Q3. To provide a bit more color on this, we sourced hundreds, literally hundreds of items from Japan, and they range from components such as LCDs, optical drives, NAND Flash and DRAM to base materials such as resins, coatings and foil that are part of the production process at several layers back in the supply chain. The earthquake and subsequent tsunami and the associated nuclear crisis caused disruption for many of these suppliers, and many unaffected suppliers have been impacted by power interruptions. But since the disaster, Apple employees have literally been working around the clock with our supplier partners in Japan, and have been able to implement a number of contingency plans. Our preference from the beginning of this tragedy has been to remain with our long-term partners in Japan. And I have to say, they have displayed an incredible resilience that I personally never seen before in the aftermath of this disaster. So while we do not anticipate -- currently anticipate any material impact to our component supply or cost in our fiscal Q3, we do need to caution everyone that the situation remains unpredictable given recent aftershocks, the uncertainty about the nuclear plant and potential power interruptions. Further, there are some supply risks that are beyond the current quarter. And although we know of no issue today that we view as unsolvable, the situation is still uncertain and there's obviously no guarantees. For this reason, it's difficult to predict whether the issues created by the tragedy would impact revenues beyond Q3. However, I'll be happy to address Q4 on our next call in July.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Okay, great. That was very helpful. I guess digging into another area of supply, looking at your iPad 2 constraints since launch in March, can you give us some color on where the constraints lie and how you're doing in terms of getting supply back in line with demand?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Well, the demand on iPad 2 has been staggering. And we're still amazed that we are still heavily backlogged not only at the end of the quarter but also up to date. However, I can tell you that I'm extremely pleased with the progress of the manufacturing ramp, and we were so confident that we rolled out to 25 additional countries at the end of last month. And we are shipping to an additional 13 countries next week, and we're planning to add even more countries through the quarter. And so I'm very confident that we can produce a very large number of iPads for the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Okay, great. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">From Citigroup, we'll go to Richard Gardner.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Richard Gardner - Citigroup Inc</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Okay, great. Thanks. I was just hoping to get a little bit more color on what drove the iPhone's strength in the quarter? If you could, by region or carrier, you mentioned that you added SK Telecom, and I'm not sure if shipments there were material during the quarter. And then, Peter, the follow-up to that I guess is, how do we think about iPhone seasonality going into the June quarter giving all of the moving parts? We have a full quarter of Verizon. In the June quarter, you've got some potential carrier expansion benefit and yet, you have a product refresh hopefully coming midyear, so I was hoping you could help us think about that a little bit for the June quarter. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Rich, it's Tim. In terms of iPhone, we did actually very well everywhere. I'd call out 2 places that -- where it was just off the charts. The U.S. grew 155% year-over-year, obviously, adding Verizon and beginning to offer iPhone to their enormous customer base was key in that. However, as you heard from AT&amp;T's announcement this morning, AT&amp;T did extremely well during the quarter. So the U.S. as a geography grew at 155% and that's about 3x IDC's forecast of growth for the smartphone market, which was about 48%. Also, we continued to be on a tear in China. Greater China saw iPhone sales being up over 3x, about 200 -- almost 250%. And this catapulted revenue for the first half or first fiscal half in Greater China to just under $5 billion, which is up almost 4x year-over-year. And so we're extremely happy with how we're doing in China.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Rich, and to hit the second part of your question. As I commented in my prepared remarks, we were able to increase the iPhone channel inventory by just over 1.7 million units in the March quarter, and we ended within our target, 4 to 6 week range of inventory. In terms of the June quarter, I would expect to see a significant year-over-year increase in sales.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Richard Gardner - Citigroup Inc</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">And any comment on the sequential, Peter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">No, I think I'll leave it at year-over-year. I would expect us to be up significantly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Richard Gardner - Citigroup Inc</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Okay. Alright. Well, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Thanks, Rich.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">From Morgan Stanley, we'll go to Katy Huberty.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Yes, thank you. Just following on the iPhone discussion, what, if anything, did you learn about the price elasticity curve for the iPhone with the $49 3GS price point in the market this quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Katy, it was very popular. It did very, very well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">And then also from the perspective of some positive feedback on LTE phones that are out from your competitors, how do you think about the maturity of those networks and Apple's sense of urgency to get products out for those faster networks? And what if any bottlenecks exist?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">I was asked this question or a similar question when we launched the iPhone with Verizon. And what I've said then, and I still see it as being the case today, and I think you can see this in the products that have been shipped, is that the first generation of LTE chipsets force a lot of design compromises with the handset, and some of those, we are just not willing to make. And so we are extremely happy with the iPhone 4 and the iPhone 3GS. And hitting 18.6 million units was something much larger than we thought we could do this quarter, and we're happy to have gotten it out to 3 more large carriers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Thanks, Katy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Shannon Cross with Cross Research.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Shannon Cross</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Thank you very much. Could you talk a bit about the international penetration of Macs? Just perhaps, I don't know, Tim, comparing your adoption curve in the U.S. to where we are internationally, and if there's any difference in terms of the type of computers that your customers are purchasing internationally?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Yes, if you look at it, Shannon, the growth on the Mac has been enormous in Asia. The last quarter, we were up 76% in Asia-Pacific. And yes, this is many multiples of the growth that the -- that region is seeing for the market. I believe the IDC forecast is around 6%. And so we're seeing enormous growth in the Mac there. Japan also did quite well on the Mac for the quarter, and the U.S. had a surprisingly strong quarter in the Mac with being up around -- Americas is up 25%. The U.S. was up just slightly higher than that. Our market share is obviously less outside the U.S. in most places than it is in the U.S., and so I think that speaks very, very well to the opportunity that the Mac has. We've now had 20 quarters in a row where we've outgrown the PC market and the momentum is still there. And we seem to be the only guys that are really focused on building innovative products in that space.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Shannon Cross</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Thank you. Has there been any difference between sort of portable versus desktop purchases internationally, or is it sort of trending in line with what you've seen in the U.S.?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">There are several of the international countries that are extremely portable focused. And you can see that we had enormous growth in our portables for the quarter. However, part of that is that we had a launch of the new MacBook Pro line. But honestly, I see popularity in both the iMac and the portable factor, and believe there is a great future for both of them.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Shannon Cross</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Great. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Thanks, Shannon.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">From Bank of Montr\u00e9al, we'll go to Keith Bachman.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Peter: Could you talk a little bit about the forces impacting your sequential decline and gross margins by, call it, 350 basis points? What are the forces that you're -- want to call out and things that we should be thinking about? Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Sure. Sequential decline is primarily being driven by the higher mix of iPad sales, which, as you know, we priced very aggressively to capitalize on our first mover advantage. Additionally, we would expect to lose some leverage from the lower sequential revenue. And as I pointed out in my prepared remarks in a moment ago, the iPhone channel inventory increased by 1.7 million units in the March quarter. It acts within our 4 to 6 week range. Conversely, the iPad channel inventory fell by 400,000 units, and we were below our 4 to 6 week inventory range. So those are the forces I would highlight.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay. And then perhaps 1 for Tim on my follow-up related to Shannon's question, how are you seeing different opportunities in the large enterprises with your MacBook in traditional markets of U.S. and Western Europe, given the seemingly greater receptiveness towards your iPhones, and what will be the tablets, I think. In other words, is that opening doors to go ahead and get the Macs in with CIOs?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">It clearly seems to be creating a halo effect for the Mac. And I think that's 1 reason we see the growth that we are seeing on the Mac. It's amazing when you see the 28% year-over-year versus the worldwide market in PCs contracting by 3 points. It's an astonishing delta.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Right, right. Okay, thanks very much guys.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Thanks Keith.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">From Barclays, we'll hear from Ben Reitzes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Benjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Yes, thanks a lot. Can you talk about the ASP trends for the iPad and the iPhone? What were they in the quarter? And are there any dynamics that would change that as we move throughout the year or at least into the June quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Sure. Ben, it's Peter. For competitive reasons, I don't want to provide any more precise ASPs for either of these products. We just don't want to help our competitors. But on the data summary, we provide you both the iPhone and iPad units that we shipped and revenues, which include the accessories that you can make your own estimate.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Benjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. And I guess my other question was with regard to the iPad constraints. When do you think that you'll be to equilibrium or have channel inventory where you need it to be? You were able to say that you increased production a lot for the iPhone. When can you say at least the same thing for the iPad where you feel like you've alleviated your shortage?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Ben, what I would say is this, I am confident we're going to produce a very large number for the quarter. Whether that will be enough to meet demand, I don't know. Demand has been staggering. I'm not going to predict when supply and demand will come into balance. I can only be confident on the supply side.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Benjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Thank you, Ben.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">We'll hear from Scott Craig with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Scott Craig</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Thanks. Tim, can you maybe talk a little bit about the CDMA phone and maybe specifically, which new markets you're looking at entering with CDMA over the next couple of quarters? And then with regards to the facility investments, can you maybe talk about the magnitude of spending you expect as you go through the year on -- with the partners, I mean, sort of in investments both on a CapEx side that you're making as well as overall investments? Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">On the carrier side, I don't want to get into specifics about the CDMA or GSM for that matter. But we are constantly looking at where we should bring on incremental partners. And as we have said earlier, we brought on 3 this quarter, 3 large ones with Verizon, SKT and Saudi Telecom. That's on top of the ones that we brought on in December where we added O2 and Vodafone in Germany. And so we are constantly looking and adding where it makes sense, and you can keep confidence that we'll continue to do that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Scott, on your capital question, a couple of updates. We expect to spend in our fiscal '11 about $5.7 billion in capital expenditures. That's unchanged from what we told you last quarter. We expect about $700 million of that to be in our retail area and $5 billion outside of retail. Some of the bigger areas outside of retail and the biggest is in the operations area. We talked about on the last call arrangements we had done with 3 suppliers. We expect to spend about $3.5 billion during fiscal '11 and fiscal '12 with those 3 suppliers on those deals in the form of prepayments and capital expenditures. And as I said in my prepared comments, we expected $900 million of that in the March quarter, and we expect to spend the remainder across fiscal '11 and fiscal '12.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Scott Craig</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Thanks, Scott.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">We'll go to Mike Abramsky with RBC Capital Markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Mike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yes, thanks very much. It may not be a perfect analogy but just wondering with the rise of Android, what might be some of the similarities and differences you see versus the rise of Windows PCs in the 1990s versus Mac? And I'm just wondering if you think in the U.S., particularly Android, could become a possible headwind to your U.S. smartphone business, and how do you maintain such incredible growth in the space of that shift?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I think, Mike, I just saw yesterday -- it's interesting you should point out the U.S. The comScore data released yesterday reported that the iOS platform outreaches Android by 59% in the U.S., and so this is an enormous percentage. On a worldwide basis, we just did 18.6 million iPhones, which is up 113%, which is materially faster than the market rate of growth. And we launched the iPad 2 and sold everyone of them that we could make. As we've said before, we're gaining traction in Enterprise on both the iPhone and iPad with astonishing 88% and 75%, respectively, of the Fortune 500 companies deploying or testing these. We've got the largest App Store with over 350,000 apps for iPhone and over 65,000 iPad-specific apps on iOS versus what appears to be fewer than 100 on Android. And so we feel very, very good about where we are and we feel great about our future product plan. We've also paid over $2 billion to developers, and we've had well over 10 billion applications downloaded. And so our business proposition is very, very strong. And as we've said before, we continue to believe and even more and more everyday that iPhone's integrated approach is materially better than Android's fragmented approach, where you have multiple OSs on multiple devices with different screen resolutions and multiple app stores with different roles, payment methods and update strategies. I think the user appreciates that Apple can take full responsibility for their experience, whereas the fragmented approach turns the customer into a systems integrator and few customers that I know want to be a systems integrator.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Mike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay, thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thank you, Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">From Piper Jaffray, we'll hear from Gene Munster.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Charles Munster - Piper Jaffray Companies</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And a question first on the iPhone. Demand, obviously, has been phenomenal. And if we look down the road at the opportunity in the post- versus the prepaid markets, are there any considerations that you can share in terms of -- that you weigh, in terms of price or subsidies or growing market share in this large prepaid market?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Gene, it's Tim. Our focus has very much been on China. We wanted to understand that market and understand the levers there. And as I said before, we're -- iPhone sales were up over 3x during the quarter. And in the first half, we did over 5 -- just slightly under $5 billion in Greater China in revenue, which is about 10% of Apple, to put it in perspective. And it wasn't but a couple of years ago that, that number would have been less than 2. And so it's a sea change. And that's certainly not, what I would call, a classic post-pay market by any means of the imagination. And so we have some ideas about other countries as well. I'm not in a position that I want to share those today. But we purposely put the bulk of our emphasis from an emerging market point of view on China to really learn, and then we're going to take that learning to other markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Charles Munster - Piper Jaffray Companies</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Would you know if China, if more than half of -- do you know if more than half of China is prepaid?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I think considerably more than half of China's prepaid, Gene. I think the first digit would start with a 9.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Charles Munster - Piper Jaffray Companies</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. Very, very good. And then separately, it's great to see Steve attending the iPad 2 event. And since going on medical leave, how closely has he stayed involved with the company's decisions, and do you have any idea when he might return?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">He is still on medical leave, as you say, but we do see him on a regular basis. And as we previously said, he continues to be involved in major strategic decisions. And I know he wants to be back full-time as soon as he can.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Charles Munster - Piper Jaffray Companies</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Great. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thank you, Gene.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I wanted to revisit the supply question on both iPhone and iPad. So last quarter, you were chasing iPhone demand, and you said you're going to work as hard as possible to try and make sure you catch up with your demand, and given the inventory build, it sounds like you're comfortable and you've gotten there. On the iPad side, it's a little less clear to me. You made, I guess, over 7 million iPads in last quarter in fiscal Q1. This quarter, including the inventory drawdown, maybe there were 5.1 million made. So was this -- I mean, you've proven that you have the capacity or the relationships to build a lot more. Was this simply a forecasting error on the iPad side? And can you comment about linearity of demand and why you couldn't have kept production at a similar rate to the prior quarter and been able to fulfill a lot more?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Let me mention a few things for you to consider, Toni. First off, product transitions are never simple. And as you can probably appreciate, we are in a position that we have to call them for many, many weeks in advance in terms of how many of the current product we want to produce and the dates at which we will announce the new product. We drew the channel down on the current product or the original iPad, I should say, by 570,000 units during the quarter. And we added at the end of the quarter 170,000 of the new iPad 2s although most of that was in transit at the end of the quarter. And so the net reduction was $400,000. And so our sell-through was above $5 million for the quarter. And again, this has to be planned quite a ways in the future. I think the key point here is -- also the dates, just to remind you, we set out an invitation to the event toward the end of February. We had the event in early March. We placed the unit on sale in the United States on March 11 and our quarter ended about 2 weeks thereafter. And so there was some expectation of a new product, and we would have obviously factored that into our thinking about the product transition as we plan the number of the original unit to build. And so I think the key point here is that I'm extremely pleased with the progress that we were making on the manufacturing ramp. We have gotten off to a materially better start and produced a lot more units than we did on the original ramp of the first iPad. And when we're so confident with our ability to supply that we've already put on 25 additional countries at the end of March, and we'll be placing on 13 more next week and we'll do even more as we stepped through the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. That's helpful. If I could turn to another topic, which is just your overall guidance for next quarter on the revenue and EPS side. If I look back at your last 8 quarters, Q2 to Q3, last 8 years. 7 of the 8, you've been flat to up in revenues. And 8 out of 8, you've been up in EPS sequentially from Q2 to Q3. On both those metrics, you're providing guidance that is dramatically down double digits. Can you comment on forces at work? Obviously, you're typically pretty conservative in your guidance. But what are the things that are kind of underpinning those directionally, those assumptions, particularly since you're pointing to a dramatic increase in iPads?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Sure. Toni, it's Peter. Let me start with top line. I would highlight 2 things. First of all, our sequential revenue guidance of $23 million is for a 7% decline, and it have been up in prior years. And 2 things to point out: first of all, in our most recent March quarter, we were able to increase the iPhone channel inventory by 1.7 million units and within our target range. And that had not occurred in any of the prior years. And second, last year, we launched the iPad in the year ago June quarter, and it was a fabulous launch contributing $2.2 billion in revenue without a comparison to the prior March quarter, and we obviously have that comparison this year. On a year-over-year basis, I am very pleased we're providing revenue guidance for growth of 46% year-over-year and EPS growing almost as quickly at 43%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Thanks, Toni.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We'll go to Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Thanks very much. Just a follow-up on the iPad question. Can you give us a split of iPad 2 versus iPad 1 as a percentage of the 5 million you shipped in the March quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We purposely aren't giving that because we don't want to help out any of our competition. But I would tell you, I wish we could have produced a lot more iPad 2s because there were certainly a lot of people waiting for them.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Secondly, the follow-up on the sequential revenue guidance question. Can you provide any color what you expect from Macs, particularly as we enter the educational buying season? Have you seen any pressure on school budgets that is creating a little caution with respect to your Mac business?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">It's a difficult funding environment for schools here in the U.S. We don't see any evidence of a share loss. And Macs are very of popular in schools and iPads are proving to be as well. On a year-over-year basis, we would expect to see a sequential -- I'm sorry, a year-over-year very significant increase in Mac sales, and I'm very confident about the product lines as we head into the back-to-school season.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">1 thing I would add to that, this was surprising to me and I think several people here is, K-12 is sort of even more conservative than Enterprise on adopting new technology. And last quarter, we were about a 1:1 ratio of iPads to Macs, which is I think very -- is amazing with the short life of the iPad, and really demonstrates what kind of opportunity there probably is there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Thank you, Chris.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Brian Blair with Wedge Partners.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Brian Blair - Wedge Partners</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Thank you. For the last several years, we've seen a new iPhone in June and we've seen a new iPod models in September. Can you maybe just share some of your views on how you've historically viewed that 1 year time horizon for new products, and maybe talk about what might cause that kind of a time line to change?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We don't -- we never comment on an Apps products, and so I don't have anything to share from that perspective.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Brian Blair - Wedge Partners</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And then can you -- you've touched on it a little bit, but can you maybe give some updated thoughts on how you view the supply-demand balance right now for the iPhone? You've talked a bit about it with iPad but 1 of the things that really stuck out to me in the last few quarters is your -- just the demand has been so great globally, especially if you've added new carriers that you still haven't met demand for the iPhone. Can you maybe just give some updated thoughts on that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes, that's a good question. We -- by the end of the quarter, we were in supply-demand balance in almost all of our major markets. And I would say as of today, we're in supply-demand balance virtually everywhere. The other products, the Mac is in supply-demand balance and the iPod is in supply-demand balance. And the iPad has the mother of all backlogs that we're working very, very hard to get out to customers as quickly as we can.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Brian Blair - Wedge Partners</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Great. Thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thank you, Brian.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">From Pacific Crest, we'll go to Andy Hargreaves.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Andy Hargreaves - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thanks. Just going back to the supply stuff real quick. Can you clarify -- would it require some kind of new disruption to cause problems beyond fiscal Q3, or were your comments just that we could kind of run low on inventory, and if production doesn't get back to full capacity, there could be issues later in the year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Sorry, I wasn't trying to be unclear. I'm saying that as of today, we currently do not anticipate any material supply or cost, in fact, as far as that goes in our fiscal Q3. That's the quarter that we're in now that ends in June. Beyond June, there are risks but there's no issue that we're aware of today that we view as unsolvable. However, new things could happen and I'm sure you've been paying attention to the news. There's aftershocks, there's still uncertainty about the nuclear plant, there's power interruptions. If that stayed at the level it is today, I'm not as worried. I would worry if something happened and took a turn for the worse. And obviously, I can't predict that and certainly hope that it does not occur.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Andy Hargreaves - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay, that's really helpful. Thanks. And then just on the iPhone, you talked a lot about the number of new Mac customers every quarter. Can you give us any help on what the mix is of replacement sales versus new customers, or what your total user base is there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">It's a number that we haven't given out before, and so it's a number that we hold tight to the best.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Andy Hargreaves - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay, thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thanks, Andy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">We'll go to Shaw Wu with Sterne Agee.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Shaw Wu - Sterne Agee &amp; Leach Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thanks for having me on. Just 2 quick ones. Just back on components, it seems if you look at other vendors and spot pricing, component pricing has actually been increasing. I just wanted a little more color why Apple has been able to beat that. I know you're a very well-run company, obviously. Just a little more color on that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes, it's a good question, Shaw. Certainly, spot markets have spiked. This is particularly true if you follow the NAND Flash and the DRAM markets. However, we do not typically buy in the spot market. And so, for that reason, we see very minimal impact. Beyond Q3, I'm saying I'm not sure because it's tough to see that far, but for Q3, we feel very good. Companies that buy on the spot market would obviously be seeing something extremely differently than we would.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Shaw Wu - Sterne Agee &amp; Leach Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay, thanks for the color on that. And then just on the iPad, in terms of the selling model, does it make sense or is there interest in terms of having it subsidized by service providers at some point?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">The iPad today is subsidized in a few markets. It is subsidized in Korea if people sign a 24-month contract, it's subsidized in Japan with a 24-month contract and a couple of European countries. But the vast majority of people that are using the iPad on 3G are doing so on a pay-as-you-go plan and no commitment plan. And so, yes, carriers can do that but I think many customers prefer the pay-as-you-go plan.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Shaw Wu - Sterne Agee &amp; Leach Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay, thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thank you, Shaw.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">From UBS, we'll go to Maynard Um.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Maynard Um - UBS Investment Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thank you. 2 questions. Last year, when you gave gross margin guidance for the fiscal third quarter, I think you -- 1 thing you mentioned was a new product transition that would impact the gross margins. Just curious if that's also a factor. You didn't mention that. And then secondly, if you could just talk a little bit about the suit against Samsung. I'm just wondering how that might impact anything on your component-supply relationship? Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I'll take your gross margin question, it's Peter. It's hard for us to comment on gross margin changes year-over-year because we're in different product cycles, commodity environments, different mixes and other factors. So I prefer just to talk about it sequentially, and I gave you really the biggest drivers of the change that we see. We expect to have a sequential increase in terms of our mix of iPad sales and also expect our revenues to be down sequentially a little bit and to lose some leverage. So those are the factors that I think are important on a sequential basis for those margin.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And on your question on Samsung, we are Samsung's largest customer and Samsung is a very valued component supplier to us, and I expect the strong relationship will continue. Separately from this, we felt the Mobile Communication Division of Samsung had crossed the line. And after trying for some time to work the issue, we decided we needed to rely on the courts.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Maynard Um - UBS Investment Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Great, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Thank you, Maynard.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">We'll go to Mark Moskowitz with JP Morgan.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Mark Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes, thanks. Tim, you mentioned earlier about the success of the iTunes here. Can you talk a little philosophically about what will be [ph] the next to really optimize that platform in terms of cloud-like capabilities? And then, Peter, the question for you is really around the OpEx. How should we think about OpEx? Does your guidance already imply that you will have to increase some S&amp;M employees to serve these greater region enterprises? Or is that already kind of in the model?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I'll take both your questions. We don't talk about what we'll do in the future, so I'm quite limited to what we can say about the future of iTunes. We operate the most popular store in the world, giving customers a fabulous experience. We have the largest libraries and have provided more content to more customers than anybody. We're very confident about what we're doing and what we will do in the future. I can't take it beyond there. In terms of OpEx, we've provided guidance for the June quarter, about $2.5 billion, and that includes our thinking for the investment that we're going to make in the quarter for the business. We are investing in engineering, in our retail stores, we are investing in our indirect distribution, which it would include covering the enterprise and the infrastructure investment that we need to support the terrific growth that you're seeing from the company. I'm glad that we are making good investments that are paying off but also providing -- continuing to provide leverage in the model.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Mark Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Thanks, Mark. A replay of today's call will be available for 2 weeks. It's podcast on the iTunes Store as a webcast on apple.com/investor and via telephone.

Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2011 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking today is Apple's CFO, Peter Oppenheimer; and he'll be joined by Apple COO, Tim Cook; and Treasurer, Gary Wipfler for the Q&amp;A session with the analysts. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, stock-based compensation expense, taxes, earnings per share and future products. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2010, the Form 10-Q for the first 2 quarters of fiscal 2011, and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the attached press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective date. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Peter Oppenheimer for introductory remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you, Nancy. Thank you for joining us. We're thrilled to report the highest quarterly revenue and earnings in Apple history. We also set a new all-time quarterly record for iPhone and iPad sales and a new June quarter record for Mac sales and we're extremely pleased with the momentum of our business. Revenue for the quarter was $28.6 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 82%. This record quarterly revenue topped the previous record established in the most recent December quarter by $1.8 billion and was almost $13 billion over the year ago quarter's result. The tremendous year-over-year increase was fueled primarily by dramatic growth in iPhone and iPad sales in addition to strong growth in Mac sales. Operating margin was a record high of $9.4 billion, representing 32.8% of revenue. Net income was $7.3 billion, topping the previous quarterly record set in the December quarter by $1.3 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Net income grew even faster than revenue, increasing 125% year-over-year and translated to earnings per share of $7.79. Turning to the details of the quarter. I'd like to begin with our Mac products and services. We established the new June quarter record with sales of 3.95 million Macs representing a 14% increase over the year ago quarter's result. This growth is more than 4x IDCs most recently published forecast of 3% growth for the PC market overall. Mac sales were particularly strong in our Asia-Pacific segment, where we experienced a 57% year-over-year increase in total Macs sold. We generated healthy Mac growth in both desktop and portable categories. In May, we updated the iMac with the next-generation quad core processors, powerful new graphics, high speed portable I/O technology and a new space time, HD camera. The growth in Mac portable sales was driven by strong sales of MacBook Pro, as well as MacBook Air. We began to enter the quarter with between 3 and 4 weeks of Mac channel inventory.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We are very excited to be launching Mac OS X Lion tomorrow. The Lion includes more than 250 new features such as a multi-touch gestures, system wide support for full screen apps, Mission Control, which is an innovative view of everything running on your Mac and much more.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Moving to our music products. We sold 7.5 million iPods compared to 9.4 million in the year ago quarter. Total iPod sales were ahead of our expectations and iPod touch continues to account for over half of all iPods sold. iPod share of the U.S. market for MP3 players remains at over 70% based on the latest monthly data published by MPD. And iPod continued to be the top-selling MP3 player in most countries we track based on the latest data published by GFK. We ended the quarter within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPod channel inventory.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">The iTunes store generated strong results with revenue of almost $1.4 billion. iTunes revenue was up 36% year-over-year, thanks primarily to continued strong sales of music, video and apps. With more than 225 million accounts, iTunes is the #1 music retailer in the world and customers have downloaded more than 15 billion songs today.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">I'd now like to turn to the iPhone. We were thrilled to sell a record 20.3 million iPhones compared to 8.4 million in the previous June quarter. This represents 142% year-over-year growth, which is more than double IDC's latest published estimate of 67% growth for the global smartphone market overall in the June quarter. Recognized revenue from iPhone handset and accessory sales were $13.3 billion during the quarter compared to $5.3 billion in the year ago quarter, an increase of 150%. We continue to experience very strong year-over-year iPhone sales growth in all of our operating segments. iPhone sales momentum in the Asia-Pacific region was particularly robust with sales almost quadrupling year-over-year. We continue to increase our overall iPhone manufacturing capacity in the quarter. We were pleased to launch a number of new carrier relationships. And by the end of the quarter, iPhone was available through 228 carriers in 105 countries, compared to 186 carriers in 90 countries as of the end of the March quarter. We ended the quarter with about 5.9 million iPhones in channel inventory, a sequential increase of about 700,000 to support strong iPhone demand, carrier addition and expanded distribution. We remained within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPhone channel inventory.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">iPhone continues to be adopted as the standard across the enterprise with 91% of the Fortune 500 deployed or testing the device, up from 88% last quarter. We're also seeing great growth in scale worldwide. Today, 57% of Global 500 companies are testing or deploying iPhone, fueled by strong employee demand and opportunities for custom App development. Some examples of Global 500 companies supporting iPhones on their corporate networks, include AXA, Credit Agricole, Nestl\u00e9, Dow Chemical, GlaxoSmithKline, SUPERVALU and Comcast.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Turning to iPad. We continue to be thrilled with its incredible momentum. We sold a record 9.2 million iPads during the June quarter compared to 3.3 million in the year ago quarter, an increase of 183%. We were able to increase production sequentially by over 4.5 million and we sold every iPad we can make. We launched iPad 2 in an additional 36 countries. And combining the original iPad and iPad 2, we ended the quarter with distribution in a total of 64 countries. Recognized revenue from sales of iPad and iPad accessories during the quarter was over 6 billion, compared to 2.2 billion in the year ago quarter, an increase of 179%. We ended the quarter with about 1.05 million iPads in channel inventory, a sequential increase of about 200,000, which was well below our target range of 4 to 6 weeks. Today, 86% of the Fortune 500 are deploying or testing iPad within their enterprises, up from 75% last quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We are also seeing strong adoption internationally with 47% of Global 500 companies testing or deploying iPad. In the 15 months since iPad has shipped, we've seen iPads used in the enterprise in ways we could have never imagined. Companies like Boston Scientific, Xerox and Salesforce.com are deploying thousands of iPads and revolutionize in how their sales teams engage their customers. iPad is being used inside the country's top hospitals like HCA and Cedars-Sinai and in retail at Nordstrom and at Este\u00e9 Lauder's Clinique counters. General Electric, SAP and Standard Charter have developed internal Apps for training, currency tracking and business process management to help make employees even more productive. And Alaska Airlines and American Airlines are using the iPad in cockpit to replace paper-based navigational and reference information pilots carry with him on every flight.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We continue to be delighted by the diverse and sometimes, unexpected use cases we see around iPad. Combining iPhone, iPad and iPod touch, we reached over 222 million cumulative iOS device sales through the end of the June quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Last month, we provided a preview of iOS 5, which includes over 200 new features such as notification center for viewing and managing notifications without interruption, iMessage for sending text messages, photos and videos between iOS devices and Newsstand, a new way to purchase an organized newspaper and magazine subscriptions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">With the new PC-free feature, iOS 5 users will be able to activate and set up iOS devices right out of the box with no computer required. We are looking forward to launching iOS 5 this fall.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In June, we also provided a preview of iCloud, our set of free new services that work seamlessly with applications on the customer's iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Mac or PC to automatically and wirelessly store content in the cloud, as well as push it to all the users' devices. We think customers will love using iCloud and we look forward to its release in the fall.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">The App Store continues to be incredibly successful with over 425,000 apps available in over 15 billion downloads to date. And as we mentioned last month, we're extremely pleased to have reached over 2.5 billion in cumulative payments to iOS developer, far ahead of any of our competitors.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">I'd now like to turn to the Apple Retail Stores, which generated record June quarter results. Revenue grew to $3.5 billion from $2.6 billion in the year ago quarter, an increase of 36%. This growth was driven primarily by higher volumes of iPad, iPhones and Macs. The store sold 768,000 Macs compared to 677,000 Macs in the year ago quarter, an increase of 13%. And about half of the Macs sold in our stores during the June quarter were to customers who had never owned a Mac before. We opened 4 new stores in the quarter, including 2 in France, 1 in the U.K. and 1 in Germany, ending with a total of 327. With an average of 325 stores open, average revenue per store was $10.8 million compared to $9 million in the year ago quarter, an increase of 20%. Retail segment margin was $828 million compared to $593 million in the year ago quarter. Store traffic continues to be very strong. We hosted 73.7 million visitors in the June quarter compared to 60.5 million in the year ago quarter, an increase of 22%. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Our recently launched, personal setup program is off to a great start. Customers love this new feature the retail store experience that they're up and running with their new products before they leave. During the June quarter, we set up over 2 million Macs, iPhone, iPads and iPods collectively.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We plan to open 30 new stores in the September quarter, including our first store in Hong Kong. That will bring us to a total of 40 store openings in fiscal 2011, including 28 new stores outside United States.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Total company gross margin was 41.7%, which was 370 basis points higher than our guidance. This difference was a result of 3 approximately equal factors: a stronger mix of iPhone; lower commodity and other costs, which included some one-time items; and leverage on the higher revenue. Operating expenses were $2.54 billion and included $232 million in stock based compensation expense. OI&amp;E was $172 million and the tax rate for the quarter was 23.5%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to cash. Our cash for short-term and long-term marketable securities totaled $76.2 billion at the end of the June quarter compared to $65.8 billion at the end of the March quarter, a sequential increase of $10.4 billion. Cash flow from operations was $11.1 billion, an increase of 131% year-over-year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">I'd now like to talk about the accounting implications of some of the new aspects of our products and services. First, when we deliver Mac OS X Lion to customers, we are now including the right to receive future unspecified minor software upgrades and features when and if they become available for both the Mac operating system and our suite of Mac OS allied [ph] applications. We will continue to charge for standalone sales of our periodic major OS upgrades, such as Lion, as well as major upgrades of iLife. Revenue from these standalone sales will now be fully deferred at the time of sale and recognized over a period of 3 years. In addition to this future software upgrade right, Mac customers will have access to iCloud services when they become available in the fall. We estimate that the combined value of the software upgrade right and iCloud services for Mac customers is $22. Therefore, as of June 6, we began deferring $22 of the revenue associated with each new Mac sold. And we will recognize these deferred amounts as revenue over a period of 4 years. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Purchasers of IOS devices will also have access to iCloud. So beginning on June 6, we begin to sign a portion of the revenue from each iOS device sold to represent the estimated value of the right to receive iCloud services when they become available. That deferred amount is in addition to the amount that we will already deferring for each iOS device sold to represent the right to receive future iOS software upgrades.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As a result, beginning on June 6, we are deferring a total of $16 of revenue for each iPhone and iPad sold and a total of $11 for each iPod touch sold and recognizing those amounts over a period of 2 years. As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking statements that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We expect revenue to be about $25 billion compared to $20.3 billion in the September quarter last year. We expect gross margin to be about 38%, reflecting approximately $55 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be about $2.725 billion, including about $245 million related to stock-based compensation expense.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We expect OI&amp;E to be about $50 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 24%. We are targeting EPS of about $5.50.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In closing, we're extremely pleased with our record revenue and earnings and the tremendous customer response to our products. Through the first 3 quarters of fiscal 2011, we have generated $35 billion in year-over-year revenue growth translating to a 78% increase. At the same time, we have generated over $9.5 billion in year-over-year earnings growth, representing a 99% increase. We remain very excited about our new product pipeline and we look forward to releasing the Mac OS X Lion tomorrow and bring in the wonderful new features of iOS 5 and iCloud to customers this fall. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">[Operator Instructions]</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p5\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">[Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">The 12% revenue downtick, Peter, in September is much more conservative than your typical September guidance and what you end up reporting in September, which is usually a 20% plus increase for the last 4 years. Can you help us understand why you expect this next quarter to trend softer than seasonal and maybe how you handicap the impact from some of the new software services and products that you expect to launch in the quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Sure. Let me start with the units and I'll give you some thoughts on revenue. For the education-buying season, September has historically been more weighted to higher education and we would expect this to be the same this year. We have the best line-up of Macs ever and we'd expect to see a year-over-year increase in sales. We also expect a year-over-year increase in iPhone sales. And for iPad, we're continuing to expand our quarterly production capacity and point of sale and we'd expect a significant year-over-year increase in sales. For iPod, we would expect to see a sequential year-over-year decline. As we announced at WWDC, we have a lot going on in the fall with the introduction of iOS 5 and iCloud. We also have a future product transition that we're not going to talk about today and these things will impact our September quarter. We remain very confident in our business, our new product pipeline and our momentum.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Peter, as that relates to future product transitions, can you just remind us how you approach working those into your guidance, you tend to be conservative and wait and see what happens with those products?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Well, as I've said a moment ago, we're not going to talk about this in any detail today. We factored our thinking into our guidance. We are incredibly confident about our business, our new product pipeline and what we're doing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">From Cross Research, we'll go to Shannon Cross.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Shannon Cross</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Tim, could you talk a bit about iPad 2 sales and trends? It's still relatively early I suppose, but I'm curious as to what you're seeing in terms of any potential cannibalization or shift of people away from portables, just any thoughts you have on the iPad 2?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Yes. Sure, Shannon. In terms of cannibalization, we do believe that some customers chose to purchase an iPad instead of the new Mac during the quarter, but we also believe that even more customers chose to purchase an iPad over Windows PC. And as I've said before, there's a lot more of the Windows PC business to cannibalize than the Mac. Also, we believe that the Mac has many other attributes that would make it continue to do well in the market. We're very happy that we grew 14% versus the markets growth of 2.6%, which is about 5x as Peter said earlier. And so that's what we see with iPad. As Peter said earlier, we were still selling every unit we could make during the quarter and that was the situation as we ended the quarter. As we stepped into July over the initial weeks to give you a more current update, we had been able to increase the supply further. And some SKUs and some countries are at a supply-demand balance, but we're still working very hard on the balance of the world. The sales of iPad 2 have absolutely been a frenzy for people to give one and we feel very good about the progress that we've made about ramping up and the reception that it received in marketplace.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Shannon Cross</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Great. And then if you could talk just a little bit about China. Clearly, your growth in Asia Pac was at almost 250% year-over-year, just any update on China?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Yes. That's a good question. China was very key to our results. As a reminder, we define Greater China as Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Year-over-year, it was up over 6x and the revenue was approximately $3.8 billion during the quarter and that makes the year-to-date numbers through the 3 quarters that we've had thus far around $8.8 billion. And so this has been a substantial opportunity for Apple and I firmly believe that we're just scratching the surface right now. I think there is an incredible opportunity for Apple there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">From Barclays Capital, Benjamin Reitzes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Benjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">I wanted to talk a little bit more about the outlook for gross margin. You said 38% from the 41.7%. Can you talk about what components and/or mix dynamics will impact that, Peter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Sure. We expect the gross margin, Ben as you said, to be about 38% and down about 370 basis points sequentially. We expect about 2/3 of this decline to be driven by the different product mix and we expect the remainder to be due to the loss of leverage on the lower sequential revenue. The cost of the future product transition, a full quarter of the back-to-school promotion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Benjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">I guess the components aspect of that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Ben, it's Tim, both NAND and DRAM and also LCDs, batteries, optical drives and most of the components are generally in a very positive supply situation currently. And pricing is expected to fall at or above the historical trend. Hard drive supply is currently constrained. We project the price declines in this area will be less than the historical rates. We do expect therefore components to be favorable on a sequential comparison. However, this is largely being offset by one-time benefits that we receive that are embedded in the 41.7% gross margin that Peter talked about earlier in the June quarter. And therefore, not a part of the bridge that Peter just talked about.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">From Goldman Sachs, we'll hear from Bill Shope.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Hopefully, I didn't miss this, but can you give us a little more color on that one-time benefit in gross margins, how significant was it? And any color on what drove that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Sure. Bill, it's Peter. We saw some benefits in our warranty and phone support area and some settlements that we had. They weren't huge in the June quarter, but we did see some benefits there. And as Tim said, we see that generally offsetting, the reversal of that generally offsetting the component benefits that he just talked about in the September quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay. Great. And then a quick follow up. There's been a lot of news around patent disputes as of late, some seems to have gone in Apple's favor, while others haven't. Can you help us understand, Tim, how to put these events in context? How we should think about your IP strategy overall and perhaps how all this is potentially impacting the competitive landscape in smartphones and tablets?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We have a very simple view here, and that view is, we love competition. We think it's great for us and for everyone. But we want people to invent their own stuff and we're going to make sure that we defend our portfolio perfectly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Richard Gardner with Citigroup.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Richard Gardner - Citigroup Inc</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Surprised nobody has asked it, but I was just hoping that you could provide a little more color on what drove the iPhone's strength in the quarter, was it new carriers or existing, new countries or existing? I know you've specifically referred to China as being a driver, but just a little more color on what you saw with iPhone in the quarter, please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Yes. Richard, it's Tim. It's a great question. We did add 42 new carriers and 15 new countries during the quarter, and so we continued our expansion efforts to get up beyond the 2.25 carrier number and above 100 countries. However, those occurred throughout the quarter and the real sequential improvement, frankly, was due to emerging and developed markets. China was a big part of it, Latin America driven by Brazil and Mexico was a big part of it, and the Middle East was a big part of it, which I think is great for Apple because these are markets that Apple historically has not been as strong and we're really beginning to see the fruits of our labor in these markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Richard Gardner - Citigroup Inc</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And then, Tim, would you be willing to give us, as a follow-up, any sort of milestones that you're hoping to hit for the next quarter or 2 in terms of new carriers and countries for iPhone?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">No, but I think you can see that it's something that is of great focus to us. We want to do business with great partners and there are still great partners out there to do business with, and so we're obviously off working new relationships.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Charles Munster - Piper Jaffray Companies</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">The iPhone clearly is gaining share, but comments from Google last week just said Android activations were up 56% quarter-over-quarter and by our math, it looks like iOS activations were up around 20%. Tim, you mentioned that China is on fire right now up 600%. Obviously, you're doing relatively well in emerging markets but any thoughts in terms of how do you think, I guess, about that Android activation number relative to your business?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">I think the Android activation number is a difficult one to get our hands around, because unlike our numbers, which you can kind of go to our data sheet and you can add the iPods and the iPads and make a reasonable approximation of the iPod touch which spans over half of our iPod sales. You can quickly see that in the June quarter that we sold over 33 million iOS devices and across time, as Peter mentioned in his opening comments, we are now over 222 million cumulative iOS devices. And so we think this is incredible. And so our numbers are very straight forward, they're transparent and they're reported quarterly. In terms of iPhone, iPhone is up 142% year-over-year. This is more than 2x the rate of growth of the smartphone market. We think that's incredible. Also, as Peter said earlier, we sold every iPad 2 in the quarter that we could make and so there certainly was not a shortage of demand. We're also gaining traction in enterprise. From the numbers that Peter spoke of, obviously, now our attention is not turning to getting corporations to test and pilots, but it's more -- was really converted to more of a penetration focus. Our App Store is the largest by far and if you look at iPad specific apps, we are over 100,000. And I think you would be hard-pressed to find a little bit of a few 100 on the other platform. It also doesn't appear that the other tablets are getting any traction to speak of, and we've paid over $2.5 billion to developers and so there's a great business proposition for developers and you can tell the customers about it because we have well over 15 billion apps that have been downloaded. And so we're very, very confident of the product. We're confident with the App Store. We're confident with our proposition for developers. The customer stat in every survey I had seen ranks the iPhone #1. And so we're very confident in the customer reception. We're also very confident in our roadmap and so we feel very, very good. You may have seen the data that just came out, I believe, it was yesterday, from ChangeWave that reaffirmed once again that iPhone is the clear leader in customer satisfaction and also was the #1 preference to those people planning to buy smartphone in the next 90 days. And so it seems like there's a lot of great things and we feel absolutely fantastic about it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Charles Munster - Piper Jaffray Companies</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. Just a follow-up question, any update on Apple TV and maybe some thoughts on your strategy in the connected TV markets?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Apple TV continues to do well, but I don't want to mislead. We still call it a hobby here and we do that because we don't want anyone to conclude that it's another leg of the stool because it's not in the same market that iPhone is in, or that the iPad is in, or that the Mac is in, or that the iPod is in. And so we love the product It's clear that customers love the product. We really guided right when we went to the new Apple TV just last fall. But right now, it's still a hobby status that we're continuing to invest in it because we think that there is something there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">From JPMorgan, we'll go to Mark Moskowitz.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Mark Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I just want to touch base here, Tim, on just the scintillating sales velocity. Is Apple at a point now where you kind of diversify your contract manufacturing base, as well as even your non-Apple retail channel? And what are the opportunity and risk there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">In terms of the non-Apple retail channel, if you take the iPhone as an example, which as you know makes up a large percentage of our business, we have about 115,000 points of sale. And so I feel that we're incredibly diversified. We're selling through carriers, through retail. We're selling through our own stores, through our online store. We're selling through companies that have direct sales forces. We are selling to enterprise, including an overlay sales force of our own. So I think the channel is extremely well-diversified. There are still countries, where we're still building the channel and so I don't want to give you a view that I think the journey is completed, but in the mature markets I feel that the channels are in good shape. And in the markets, where we're putting more and more energy, obviously, there is still channel development to do there, but I think it's well understood and under control. So as I don't, really, that's not something that I worry about at all, actually. In terms of suppliers, I don't want to get into this in any detail, because I think this is one of those things for us that is the part of the magic and a part of the things that we feel that we have some secret sauce in and I prefer not to share it. But your general point about, are we too centralized in one place, or are we too dependent on a place. You can -- the people hear that are involved in the supply chain, we got some outstanding ones, always ask that question and I think we always at the end of the day make the right decision for Apple.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Mark Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Understood. Appreciate that. Maybe just a follow-up for you Tim or Peter. You've talked in the past about the iPhone and the iPad 2 just because of the leading edge technology that sometimes the manufacturing yield are a little lighter than what we all think. Where are you guys now in terms of manufacturing yields, have you walked further up the curve in terms of better utilization?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I don't want to give you a specific yield numbers, but as I've said earlier, the supply of iPad improved dramatically in the quarter, that allowed us to do the over 9.2 million, that's up from the 4.7 from the prior quarters that we added almost 100%. I also said that we had further incurred the supply in the initial weeks of July. And that's allowed us to get into a supply-demand balance on some SKUs and some countries. So I feel very, very good about our progress in that area.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Mike Abramsky with RBC Capital Markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Mike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Tim, the trajectory of iPhone growth has been nothing less of astounding because, now you're 142%. You were 113%, last quarter, 86%. So I'm just trying to understand what your thinking is on the keys to sustain that growth. Particularly, do you see the current pricing, for example, and tariffs perhaps approaching a level, maybe North America saw saturation. Do you need to address that? Different form back factors, expanded distribution or just stay on the same business model, especially these lower cost Android competitors potentially coming from Asia? Can you talk to that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Well, I think on the tariff side, Apple doesn't set the tariffs. So it is set by the carrier. And so I think that's a better question for them, but at a very macro level, I think what you would find if you went out and talked to several around the world is that virtually every one of them are desirous of having more and more customer have a smartphone and begin to use data on their networks because this is the way for them to expand their ARPUs. And I firmly believe there is no better device than the iPhone for someone to move from any phone up to a smartphone. So ease of use is just unparalleled, and the ecosystem is unparallel. And so I think there is a good alignment in that area. I mentioned a few moments ago that the key driver in our sequential results on the iPhone are sequential improvement in unit, we're emerging and developing market. So you can see that we're putting more and more energy in these markets that have been a bit more difficult to do well in versus some of the markets that are in the established countries and subsidized countries or they're primarily subsidizing. So I think we have a very good focus here. And I think we can compete with anyone.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Mike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So those markets would have prepay, for example, lower purchasing power, indirect distribution. Are those things you are going to need to address through pricing and other means?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Those markets that I mentioned that we were doing well in, there are some percentage of postpaid in some of those markets, but if you looked at the market in the aggregate, most of those markets are predominantly prepaid. In some cases, we've convinced someone to start a postpaid plan because in the long term, I think that's better for the customer, the carrier and us. But in general, we are also playing in the prepaid market. We're not avoiding that market. We don't want to avoid that market. We know that we need to play there in order to have the kind of volumes that we'd like to have. And in terms of your question on expanding channels and developing channels, we're obviously that is -- is on our list and with the 115,000 down now, we have some experience there. We know we've got a lot more to do, but we've got some experience under our belt now to play with.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">From Bank of Montreal, we'll hear from Keith Bachman.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Tim, this is for you. Mac growth was about 5% sequential. In the past 2 years, the sequential growth has looked more like 17% to 18% and notebook sequential growth was even below that. So I wanted to go back to what do you think in this quarter was cannibalization versus perhaps some hold-backs in anticipation of Lion? And how does that show up you think in terms of catch-up in the September quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yes. I really look more at year-over-year than I do sequential on the Mac. But I am going to get at your -- the answer to your question anyway. I think, first of all, I am proud of the numbers that we achieved. To grow at 14%, when the market is growing at 2.6%, doing 5x the rate of growth is certainly something to be proud of. However, in terms of why isn't the number higher than 14%, obviously, we always focus on that. No matter if the number was 42%, we would focus on that. I think there are 3 things that are the primary factor. And I don't want to try to quantify these for you, but I do want to list them and how we look at it. The first is, as I've said before, I think there were some cannibalization of new Mac by iPad. We shipped a record 9.2 billion iPads during the quarter, which is over 2x the number of Macs that we shipped. And it's clear that some customers chose to purchase an iPad instead of a new Mac. But the thing that really excites us is that more customers chose to buy an iPad than a Windows PC. The second one is, I think, some customers have delayed purchase until Lion becomes available. And as Peter commented on earlier, we are launching Lion tomorrow. And we're looking forward to getting Lion out. It's a fantastic product. The guys have worked very, very hard on it and it's really a revolutionary change. But the third thing that I wouldn't discount it, in the year ago quarter, we launched new MacBook Pro. In this particular quarter, we launched new iMac. Both products were well received, however, the MacBook Pro makes up over the majority of the units that we sell in the Mac area. And so obviously, if you change the MacBook Pro and it's well received, it's going to make the comp more difficult to compare to. And so those are the 3 things that I think are primarily why the number isn't more than it is. But I don't want to lose site that it is already is 5x the industry and this is the 21st consecutive quarter that we beat the market.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">My follow-up then is if I look at the sequential growth pattern in the September quarter, I would assume given the demand and as you said, you're catching up here in the month of July that iPads would increase sequentially, including probably some potential channel fill. But I just want to see if you could give us some feedback on what the growth trajectory look like after this great quarter here in iPads.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Well, we don't predict unit sales. We aggregate things into a guidance and Peter went through that earlier. So I don't want to make a comment about iPad other than I think Peter said earlier, which I'm sure that you would have reached conclusion of anyways that we think iPad will grow significantly year-over-year. And we'll leave the rest of it to you to conclude and then we would be very happy to report in October how we did that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">From Bank of America, we'll go to Scott Craig.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Scott Craig</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Tim, could you maybe provide a bit more color around what exactly the issues are for the iPad ramping up into the sort of levels that you want to get to? And can you hazard a guess as to when you think you'll be at sort of equilibrium on a global basis from a production and supply standpoint?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">This is a good sort of problem per se is that the demand is fantastic. And so there's not something that I would point to on a supply side saying that this is creating a huge issue, it's the good problem. And as I said before, and I generally don't do that, but in this case, I am to talk about July. In the first weeks of July, we're now 3 -- a little over 3 weeks into the quarter. Supply has further improved since we ended our June quarter and that further improvement has led some SKUs in some countries to become in supply-demand balance. Now, I'm not going to project what will happen to the other country, but obviously, we're working very, very hard to get as many units to customers as we can. And we placed our latest thinking in the guidance obviously.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Scott Craig</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And maybe just a quick follow-up, Tim. Is there anything you guys are doing differently as far as investing in the enterprise sales force, so to speak, or doing anything differently as far as going to market on the enterprise side that you can point us to? And then, I guess, we'll see the fruits of that labor as we sort of go forward here.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We have a dual-prong strategy with enterprise on both the iPad and the iPhone. As we work with the carrier sales forces and they have very large ones because they're selling their services into enterprise and many of these enterprises want that one of our device is connected to it and so we train and provide quite a bit of help to the carrier forces. Plus we do some sales, directly our sales or act as an overlay sales force to a channel that sells to enterprise. And I would characterize this as we're still building it out and we do a bit better each quarter. We're very, very happy with the numbers that Peter talked about earlier about the level of interest and taking people to the pilot and initial deployment stages. And now our attention is moving to penetration within those accounts versus sort of getting on the standards lists. And I think you'd really look at it fairly to be this far into the enterprise with a product that's only been shipping for 15 months in the case of iPad is absolutely incredible, because the enterprise is typically much more conservative and takes a long time to evaluate products. In this case, people are moving at a speed I haven't seen. Also in a group that's not thought of as enterprise like K-12, our K-12 generally takes a very long time for new product categories, but last quarter, we sold more iPads in K-12 than we did not. And to do that after just 5 quarters is absolutely shocking. We would've never predicted that. And so we feel very, very good about the different area that iPad is being sold into. It's clear it has a universal appeal in many different markets from consumer to business to government and on and on.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">From Wedge Partners, we'll go to Brian Blair.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Brian Blair - Wedge Partners</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Can you just talk a little bit about your views on iCloud and just how you feel as a service it's going to drive more volumes to Mac and maybe just talk about what are your expectations on the halo effect across other iOS devices?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">This is Peter. We cannot wait to get iCloud and iOS 5 into the hands of customers in the fall. We really think that we have done it right with iCloud. We're going to deliver customers just a seamless integrated experience that we think that they are going to love. We're going to make it very easy and it didn't go unnoticed back to us yesterday that in the ChangeWave results, that was one of the reasons cited why the iOS devices are #1 in terms of intent to buy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Brian Blair - Wedge Partners</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And maybe just briefly, if you can comment on, just do you feel like you have much of a lead over your competitors and the ability to instantly mirror content across different devices? It feels like it's a real competitive edge for you, but I'd love to hear your thought if you wouldn't mind sharing any.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Well, we're certainly very, very good with the Internet, with telecommunications in delivering content. I think we have proven it in Mac for a decade first beginning with iTunes and now with the App Store and our payments to developers exceeding $2.5 billion. So we probably have some things to learn as we go forward. But have a lot of skills and are very excited to get iCloud in the customers' hands.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">We'll go to Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Tim, I wanted to revisit China and also prepaid phones. China Mobile recently said it has 5.6 million phones on its net -- iPhones on its network as of the end of May, and was adding them at an incredible rate. Obviously, China Mobile doesn't sell the phone. So that would certainly point to a lot of a prepaid phones or unlocked phones on their network. I believe also your direct distribution in China for the iPhone, both online and retail stores is in a prepaid fashion. So I was wondering if you could tell us how significant prepaid is in China and other emerging markets, how much progress you've made there and what lessons you've learned given that you yourselves are also selling them prepaid? And I have a follow-up, please.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Prepaid or unlocked phones are, said more an English, phones sold without a contract are very key in China and very key in a number of the emerging markets, where the credit systems are not as well established as they are in the U.S., Japan and Western Europe and Australia, et cetera. And so you can look at our volume, Toni, that the iPhone volume for the first 3 quarters of the fiscal year was up 5x year-over-year. And iPhone is the key contributor to Greater China having a cumulative revenue of around $8.8 billion for the first 3 quarters. And so I am not saying at all that we have figured out precisely how to play perfectly in the environment we have and I think we have more to do and more to learn. But I feel very, very good about our progress. I think if any of us would have been told a year ago that we would do $3.8 billion in Greater China in a quarter, I don't think very many of us would've believed it. And I don't think any of you would've believed that. And so we feel very, very good about it and we're taking those learnings and applying those to other markets as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">If I could follow up, your market share data is pretty irrefutable, and it's pretty consistent in terms of your being a share gainer. There are parts of the world in developed countries like U.K., Germany, France and Japan, where some of the recent market data suggests that you've actually lost share in iPhones on a year-over-year basis in Q2. I was wondering if you could tell us whether gaining share in the smartphone category for iPhone is strategically important to Apple longer term, and how we get our minds around sustained share gains given that most of the market data says smartphones above $300 are going to grow a lot slower than the overall smartphone market. So how do we: a, are share gains important to Apple in this marketplace; and how do we reconcile where you participate in its market growth rate relative to the overall market?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Share gain is important anywhere where we are going, the opposite way then we're not happy. And you can bet that we're working hard to change that. In terms of playing in different price points, we do offer the 3GS, as an example today, which in the U.S. is $49 with a contract. And if you step that out into prepaid market, it really depends upon the VAT and duty and channel kind of uplifts as to what it is. So it varies greatly market-to-market. But it's clearly, in a distinctly different price than the iPhone 4 is. Our philosophy is the same as it's always been, Toni. We will only make products that we're proud of, that are the best in the world, and if we can do that and the price is lower then we're great with that. An example of that, that happened some time ago is the iPod shuffle was created. It started at a different price point, but it's now at $49 and that's because it's a product we're very proud of. It's very innovative. A lot of people love that product. So that's always the question for us in the litmus test. We will only make products that we're very proud of, that we want to own, that are the best in the world and regardless of what the price band analysis. Also, as we've seen and as I'm reminded time and time again as I look at some of the China data is it's up to us to convince people to maybe spend a little more for a materially better experience of product. And we think that people will do that if the product is great and if it's messaged appropriately and we got a lot of experience in both of those areas.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">We'll hear from Brian Marshall with Gleacher &amp; Company.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brian Marshall - Gleacher &amp; Company, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you've learned with respect to media consumption on the iPad thus far?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Timothy Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">We learned that people love using it, Brian, for a whole variety of things. And that's the beauty of the iPad is that if you talk to 10 people, they would likely give you 10 different reasons why they love it. And I think that's the reason it's doing so well among a very diverse group of consumers in a diverse group of people in the market and geographies.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brian Marshall - Gleacher &amp; Company, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And then perhaps a quick follow-up. With respect to content accumulation in regards to video, can you talk a little bit why we don't have more movie titles on iTunes at this point, and if we are going to be rectifying that in the future?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Sure. Brian, it's Peter. We have a very, very broad library of movies and TV shows particularly here in the United States. We are adding more content internationally each quarter and look for some more content later this quarter across the various stores. We have some neat stuff coming.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Thanks, Brian. That concludes our Q&amp;A session.

Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2011 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements including without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, stock-based compensation expense, taxes, earnings per share and future products. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2010, Form 10-Q for the first 3 quarters of fiscal 2011 and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today along with the attached press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">I'd now like to turn the call over to Apple CEO, Tim Cook, for introductory remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon, everyone. This is our first earnings call since the passing of Steve Jobs. The world has lost a visionary, a creative genius and an amazing human being. Steve was a great leader and mentor and inspired everyone at Apple to do extraordinary things. His spirit will forever be the foundation of Apple, and we are dedicated to continuing the amazing work that he loved so much. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Only Apple brings together software, hardware and services into such a powerful and integrated experience for our customers. As we move forward, we will continue doing that with relentless focus. I'd like to take this opportunity to express our gratitude for all of the condolences and expressions of support that we have received following Steve's passing. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">With that, I'd like to turn over the call to Peter to discuss our Q4 results. Peter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you, Tim. We are very pleased to report record September quarter revenues and earnings. We set a new all-time quarterly record for Mac and iPad sales, and we established a new September quarter record for iPhone sales. We're very proud of these results and with the momentum of our business. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Revenue for the quarter was $28.3 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 39%. The year-over-year increase was fueled primarily by strong growth in iPad, Mac and iPhone sales. Operating margin was $8.7 billion, representing 30.8% of revenue. Net income was $6.6 billion, increasing 54% year-over-year and translating to earnings per share of $7.05. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Turning to the details of the quarter. I'd like to begin with our Mac products and services. We established a new all-time quarterly record with sales of 4.89 million Macs, exceeding the previous record set in the last December quarter by 760,000 Macs, representing a 26% increase over the year-ago quarter's results. That is more than 6x IDC's most recently published forecast of 4% growth for the PC market overall in the September quarter. Mac sales increased strongly in each of our operating segments led by Asia-Pacific with growth of 61% year-over-year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">The increase in Mac sales was fueled by the very strong growth in MacBook Air as well as the continued strong performance of MacBook Pro. In July, we updated the MacBook Air with the next-generation processors, high-speed Thunderbolt I/O technology and a backlit keyboard. And while the portables represented 74% of the total Mac mix, we also generated record desktop sales in the quarter primarily due to continued strength of iMac. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We launched Mac OS X Lion on July 20 and customer response has been tremendous with over 6 million Lion downloads during the September quarter. We began and ended the quarter with between 3 and 4 weeks of Mac channel inventory. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Moving to our music products. We sold 6.6 million iPods compared to almost 9.1 million in the year-ago quarter. Though down year-over-year, total iPod sales were ahead of our expectations and iPod touch continue to account for over half of all iPods sold. iPod's share of the U.S. market for MP3 players remains at over 70% based on the latest monthly data published by MPD, and iPod continues to be the top-selling MP3 player in most countries we track based on the latest data published by GFK. We ended the quarter within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPod channel inventory. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">The iTunes Store generated record results with revenue in the quarter of almost $1.5 billion. The iTunes catalog continues to grow, and customers have downloaded over 16 billion songs and 650 million TV shows to date. We've also been very pleased with the growing popularity of the iBookstore with over 180 million downloads of iBooks to date. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">I'd now like to turn to iPhone. We were very pleased to sell 17.1 million iPhones compared to 14.1 million in the previous September quarter. This represents 21% year-over-year growth and a new September quarter record. We experienced particularly strong iPhone sales growth in our Asia-Pacific segment where iPhone sales more than doubled year-over-year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We were pleased with the iPhone sales growth as we prepared for the transition to the iPhone 4S. We expected iPhone sell-through to decline sequentially from the June quarter as a result of new product rumors following the announcement at our Developers Conference in June that iOS 5 and iCloud would become available in the fall. As we predicted, iPhone sell-through did decline across the quarter especially in the second half as new product speculation intensified. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We ended the quarter with about 5.75 million iPhones in channel inventory, a sequential decline of about 180,000, which places within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPhone channel inventory. Recognized revenue from iPhone handset and accessory sales was $11 billion during the quarter compared to $8.8 billion in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 24%. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Given the October launch of the iPhone 4S, we opted to defer new carrier and country additions from this September quarter until after the launch. As we indicated 2 weeks ago, we were very pleased to have recently added Sprint and KDDI to our carrier line up. These additions bring us to 230 carriers in 105 countries. For the sixth consecutive time, iPhone ranked highest in consumer reports, wireless consumer smartphone customer satisfaction survey, achieving the highest ratings for overall satisfaction as well as for performance, ease of operations, features and design. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">iPhone continues to be adopted as the standard across the enterprise with 93% of the Fortune 500 deploying or testing the device, up from 91% last quarter and 60% of the Global 500 testing or deploying iPhone, up from 57% last quarter. A recent example of iPhone's enterprise success is Lowe's. Lowe's is in the process of rolling out over 40,000 iPhones with a custom application to allow their store associates to execute realtime inventory checks, product orders and interactive customers with how-to videos. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Additional examples of companies around the world supporting iPhone on their corporate networks include L'Oreal, Royal Bank of Scotland, SAP, Texas Instruments, Jacobs Engineering Group, Tenet Healthcare, Jaguar Land Rover, Takeda Pharmaceuticals, Lincoln National and CSX Corporation. And of course, we're thrilled to begin shipping iPhone 4S this month. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We are extremely enthusiastic about Siri, the iPhone 4 intelligent assistant that helps you get things done by just asking, and we think customers will love the performance of the iPhone 4S' dual-core A5 chip, all-new camera and full 1080p HD video recording. Now shipping in 7 countries, we are working hard to get iPhone 4S in customers' hands as quickly as possible. We look forward to rolling it out in 22 more countries by the end of this month. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to iPad. We continue to be thrilled with its incredible momentum. We set a new record with sales of 11.1 million iPads during the September quarter compared to 4.2 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 166%. We've said from the beginning that the tablet market is a huge opportunity for Apple, and we are very excited with our current performance and the tremendous customer enthusiasm for iPad. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We launched iPad 2 in additional 20 countries, ending the September quarter with distribution in a total of 90 countries. Recognized revenue from sales of iPad and iPad accessories during the quarter were $6.9 billion compared to $2.8 billion in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 146%. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We ended the quarter with about 2.5 million iPads in channel inventory, a sequential increase of about $1.45 million, which places within the target range of 4 to 6 weeks. It's been just 18 months since we introduced iPad and the pace at which businesses worldwide are adopting this technology is unprecedented. Today, 92% of the Fortune 500 are testing or deploying iPad within their enterprises, up from 86% last year. Internationally, 52% of the Global 500 are testing or deploying iPad, up from 47% last quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Every day, we learn about innovative new ways our enterprise customers are using iPad. The airline industry is a great example of the momentum we're seeing. United Continental Holdings is putting iPads in every cockpit to replace heavy, paper-based flight bags. In Japan, All Nippon Airways is now using iPad in training programs for flight attendants. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Sonic Automotive is using iPad for customer check-in at the service department and also to provide analytics to regional managers.  Aflac, Biogen and General Mills have developed internal apps that their field sales teams leverage daily, and technicians of Siemens Energy are bringing iPads along when they do maintenance work at the top of their wind turbines. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Combining iPhone, iPad and iPod touch, we surpassed the 0.25 billion cumulative iOS device sales in the September quarter. We were very pleased to begin delivering iOS 5 last week and customers are loving its many new features, including Notification Center, iMessage, Newsstand and Reminders. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We're also very excited to launch iCloud last week, with breakthrough services including iTunes in the Cloud, Photo Stream and Documents in the Cloud. We believe iCloud is the easiest way for customers to manage their content going far beyond anything else available today and early reviews have been excellent. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">The App Store continues to be incredibly successful with over 500,000 apps available and over 18 billion downloads to date. We expanded the App Store to 33 additional countries during the September quarter, ending with a total of 123 countries. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">I'd now like to turn to the Apple Retail Stores. Revenue was $3.6 billion, an increase of 1% over the prior-year quarter. The stores experienced very strong year-over-year growth in Mac and iPad sales, which was largely offset by decline in iPhone sales given the tough comparisons in the year-ago quarter when iPhone 4 was launched and compounded by speculation about a new iPhone this year. The stores generated record-breaking Mac results, with sales reaching 1.1 million compared to 874,000 in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 25%. And about half of the Macs sold in our stores during the September quarter were to customers who had never owned a Mac before. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We opened 30 new stores in the quarter, 21 of which were outside United States. On the last weekend of the quarter, we opened 7 stores in 6 countries, including our first store in Hong Kong. With our highest opening day for Mac sales ever, our Hong Kong store joins our 5 other China stores as the highest traffic and among our highest revenue stores in the world. We ended the quarter with a total of 357 stores. With an average of 336 stores opened, average revenue per store was $10.7 million compared to $11.8 million in the year-ago quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Retail segment margin was $679 million compared to $917 million in the year-ago quarter. Store traffic continues to be very strong. We hosted a record 77.5 million visitors in the September quarter. As we look ahead to fiscal 2012, we will continue to focus on international expansion. In total, we expect to open about 40 stores with approximately 3/4 of them outside United States. We will also be expanding or replacing higher volume stores primarily in the U.S. that are simply too constrained to deliver our desired customer experience. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Total company gross margin was 40.3%, which was 230 basis points higher than our guidance. This difference was almost entirely due to lower component and other product costs. Operating expenses were $2.67 billion and included $253 million of stock-based compensation expense. OI&amp;E was $81 million. The tax rate for the quarter was 24.7%. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to cash. Our cash and short-term and long-term marketable securities totaled $81.6 billion at the end of the September quarter, compared to $76.2 billion at the end of the June quarter, a sequential increase of $5.4 billion. This increase was net of cash paid for the acquisition of Nortel patents and the Nokia settlement during the September quarter. Cash flow from operations was $10.4 billion, an increase of 84% year-over-year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. I'd also like to remind you that approximately once every 6 years, we add a week to the December quarter to align our fiscal periods with the December calendar. So this December quarter will span 14 weeks rather than 13 and will end on December 31. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We expect revenues to be about $37 billion compared to $26.7 billion in the December quarter last year. We expect gross margin to be about 40%, reflecting approximately $60 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be about $3.25 billion, including about $350 million related to stock-based compensation. We expect OI&amp;E to be about $85 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 24.25%. We are targeting EPS of about $9.30. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In closing, we're extremely pleased with the strong conclusion to our record-breaking fiscal 2011. Over the course of the year, we generated revenue of over $108 billion, an increase of $43 billion or 66% over our fiscal 2010 results. We blew past historical records by selling over 72 million iPhones, 32 million iPads and almost 17 million Macs in fiscal 2011. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We expanded our reach by opening 40 new retail stores, adding scores of new carrier and leaseholder relationships and broadened our online presence through Apple stores and App Stores around the world. And last but not the least, we generated almost $26 billion in net income during the year, an increase of 85% year-over-year, which was even faster than our revenue growth. We're thrilled to begin selling iPhone 4S and to bring iOS 5 and iCloud to our customers this month, and we remain very enthusiastic about our new product pipeline. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Thank you, Peter. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Operator, may we have the first question please?</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p5\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">From Goldman Sachs, we'll go to Bill Shope.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">I have a few iPhone questions if I could. Given that the 4S was launched so close to the holiday selling season, can you give us an idea of your confidence in the production ramp and the distribution ramp and how you've mitigated the risk of a shortage during peak consumer demand?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Bill, it's Tim. We've gotten off to a great start with the 4S. We've sold over 4 million in just 3 days after launch, and so we're thrilled with the start that we have. We're confident that we will have a large supply, but I don't want to predict when supply and demand might balance because the demand is obviously extremely high right now. But I'm confident that we will set an all-time record for iPhone this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Now and just a question on the September quarter iPhone dynamic. So it sounds like the primary negative impact on shipments was purely from a sell-through pause. You didn't have any real channel inventory drawdown issues affect shipments. Is that correct?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Not entirely. If you look at on the sell-through basis, the sequential comparison is down 2.4 million units. That's 19.7 million from the previous quarter, which had an inventory build in it to bring it to a sell-in of over 20 million and to 17.3 million this quarter, which had an inventory reduction of a little less than 200,000, which Peter talked about in his opening remarks. That 2.4 million was much less of a reduction than what we were expecting and was a large factor in our revenue exceeding our guidance by over $3 billion. We expected it to be greater than 2.4 million because we knew that there was great anticipation of the June or July new iPhone because that was the pace that we have been on for the last several years. And as we had predicted, that sell-through decline did occur in the quarter, but not nearly to the extent that we fought and therefore, we significantly beat our guidance. The reduction happened largely in the back half of the quarter as the speculation hit extreme highs. However, we're thrilled to be shipping the new iPhone 4S and iOS 5 and iCloud, and we're very confident that we will set an all-time record in the December quarter for iPhone sales. We -- in our wildest dreams, we couldn't have gotten off to a start as great as we have on the 4S.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">From Morgan Stanley, we'll hear from Katy Huberty.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Peter, this quarter you were able to print north of a 40% gross margin despite the mix shift away from your high-margin product and towards lower margin products. So just curious why you don't think you can do better than 40% in December given how well the iPhone 4S is already doing and the favorable component cost environment, and then I have a follow-up for Tim.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Sure. I understand your question, Katy. We expect the gross margin to be relatively flat on a sequential basis. And we expect this because as you pointed out, we do think a favorable component cost environment will continue, and we certainly expect a very strong mix of iPhones, both of which are positive for gross margins. However, we expect both of these to be basically fully offset by the impact of higher cost structures and reduced price points for the recently introduced iPhones and iPods as well as the stronger U.S. dollar. It's really strengthened in the last couple of weeks from where we were across the summer. So that's why.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Okay. And then Tim, over the course of the last year, you've provided great insight into Apple's traction in China. So I wonder if you could update us on how you're tracking in that region, but also provide some insight into how substantial China could be to Apple over time. For instance, is there any reason that China couldn't be as big as the U.S. market once you open more stores and optimize the product set there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Yes, thanks for the question. Should the China progress has been amazing, if you look at our Greater China revenue, it represented just 2% of Apple in our fiscal year '09. And in the fiscal year we just ended, it accounted for 12%, and if you just look at the quarter that we just ended, it accounted for 16%. So it's our fastest growing major region by far. It delivered $4.5 billion of our revenue for the current quarter, and that's up almost 4x or about 270% year-over-year. That brought the total revenue for the fiscal year to over $13 billion. And to further put that in context, a year ago in fiscal year '10, we were just right above $3 billion. So it is growing at a feverish pace. We have placed new retail stores there as you know. We now have 6 in Greater China. Our online store opened at the end of last year, and so we have still -- we haven't hit our one-year anniversary there yet. We have over 200 Mono-branded stores that we call APRs, which are resellers on there. That's a very premium shopping experience, and we are now up to over 7,000 point of sales on the iPhone in Greater China. And so we're continuing to make investments in this. How far can it go? Certainly in my lifetime, I've never seen a country with as many people rising into the middle class that aspire to buy products that Apple makes. And so I think it's an area of enormous opportunity, and it has quickly become #2 on our list of top revenue countries very, very quickly and we're obviously placing additional investment. We're building more stores there as well as doing quite a few other things to continue to deliver our great products to the people of China. We're also placing additional focus on some other areas that have shown great promise over this fiscal year such as Brazil. Brazil was up 118% year-over-year and went over the $900 million mark. Russia is also beginning to look more and more promising. As I've mentioned on the last call, the Middle East we believe has significant opportunities. So there's several of these markets that historically Apple has not been strong and that the iPhone has really opened up and introduced Apple to a whole set of customers that didn't get excited about looking at other products that we have. And I think certainly, the iPad will be doing the same. And so I think China, the sky is the limit there, and I wouldn't discount some of these other places that I've mentioned as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We'll go to Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Two questions. First for Tim. If you weigh in a little more on Apple's historic strength in terms of manufacturing and supply chain strategies, I know we talked about this before, Tim. But can you give us an update in terms of your margin flexibility as you start to use more than one source for certain parts of your supply chain manufacturing chain? And I have a question for Peter after that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Yes. Mark, I think we have an outstanding team in this area and a track record that's unparalleled in the industry. Although we keep trying to improve it all the time, we've also used our balance sheet in a favorable way here to do some strategic deals on different parts that we felt were very, very important to Apple across a series of products. As we get larger, there are some areas where we've elected to diversify some. However, our approach has been and I think will always be to do business with as few people as we can so we can be very deep with them and do great innovative stuff together, and you can't tend to do that when you go out to many, many different people. And I think they give us great quality and also reasonable prices, and so that winds up helping our margin.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And then the second question is around the iPad. Recently, Amazon with the Kindle Fire is trying to make the tablet market more of a soapbox derby in terms of lower price points but maybe limited feature sets. Can you kind of weigh in on what your view is? Is this making more of a hybrid market where it's not really a tablet but kind of a hybrid and Apple has not really seen any effects from a demand perspective at this point?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">We had an outstanding quarter last quarter with setting a record with doing over 11 million, and at the same time we were setting a Mac record, which is I think very phenomenal in and of itself. But we've seen several competitors come to market to try to compete with the iPad over time. They've had -- some had different form factors, different price points. And I think it's reasonable to say that none of these have gained any traction thus far. And in fact, as all of those competitors were coming to market, our share actually went up such that in the June quarter IDC -- according to IDC, we were responsible for 3 out of every 4 tablets sold. And I think when you really assess this thing and look at iOS 5, iCloud, the ecosystem with iTunes and the App Store and books and movies and the fact that we have over 140,000 native apps for iPad versus a number in the hundreds for the other guys, I feel very, very confident about our ability to compete and extremely confident in our product pipeline.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">From Piper Jaffray, we'll hear from Gene Munster.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Charles Eugene Munster - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And Peter, did I hear that right that you mentioned the deferral of iPhone for new carriers and new country additions? Wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on what that was and the potential impact on the numbers?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Gene, that's in my prepared remarks. We opted to defer adding new carriers or countries during the September quarter knowing that we would launch the iPhone 4S very early in the October month, and we wanted to launch our new carriers with our latest products so we waited. I think that did have some impact on the September quarter. I think the biggest impact were the rumors that were just very pervasive, particularly in the second half of the quarter. There just seemed to be the rumor of the day. But that's behind us. We have just started selling the iPhone 4S and it's off to a fantastic start, and we're thrilled to be including Sprint and KDDI in our carrier lineup. And we're heading into this holiday season with the best product lineup Apple has ever shipped and tremendous momentum.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Charles Eugene Munster - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And Tim, I realized the Amazon Fire question is out of the way here, but do you have any just high-level thoughts on the size of the tablet market? I mean, it's not netbooks. It's computers. I mean, how do you think about, internally thinking about, how big this market could be in the next 2 years?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">We thought, Gene, from the beginning of this that it would be a huge market, and it has been even greater than we thought. And we've now sold 40 million on a cumulative basis. And it's pretty clear to me that if you forecast out in time that the tablet market -- I still believe it will be larger than the PC market. That's not a guidance number. That's just something that I very much believe. There will be many, many more people that can access it, and the ease of use is so phenomenal and off the charts that I think it's a huge opportunity for Apple across time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">From Barclays Capital, we will hear from Ben Reitzes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">I was actually wondering if we could talk a little bit more about the iPhone. Just do you have any idea of what -- how many units do you feel were pushed out and deferred into the next quarter? And in general, what do you think -- how should we be thinking about the 4S launch given the pent-up demand from the quarter? And anything else with regard to the velocity and how it worked into your guidance of $37 billion?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Ben, I think the number -- you can't run the experiment twice. So we can't tell you with precision how many units we would have sold if there had not been rumors and people weren't expecting a new iPhone. But I certainly believe it was a substantial, and that's the reason that we called it out. And I think anybody monitoring the press would probably come to the same conclusion. You could go out and talk to a group of customers and probably get the same kind of answer. On the 4S, I think it's off the charts. If you do a comparison of the 3 days after launch of last year on iPhone 4, we came in at 1.7 million. This year, we were over 4 million in the same time frame, and so that's the mother of all uplifts. And so we're thrilled with how we've gotten started, and the feedback that we're getting from customers is just fantastic. And so I couldn't be more pleased with where we are.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And just my follow-up is with regard to the iPad category, now that it's, I wouldn't call it maturing, but a few more quarters of experience, do you -- generally in Macs, you're up a little sequentially lately in the fourth quarter. You have an extra week now. Any thoughts on how the iPad seasonality may be working in the iPad over the next quarter or 2, just in terms of more experience or gut feel for how that product progresses?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Ben, it's Peter. I'll give you some thoughts on the December quarter but we're not going to provide our thoughts yet for the March quarter. We would expect to establish new company records for both the iPhone and the iPad in the December quarter. These are fantastic products, and the momentum here is tremendous. And for Macs, we would expect to outgrow the market on a year-over-year basis and report to you our 23rd consecutive quarter of outgrowing the market.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Shannon Cross with Cross Research Financial.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Shannon S. Cross</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">My first question. Tim, can you talk a little bit more on how you see Siri and how you see Siri in the future? I mean, is this a feature or do you see it more as a key way that consumers are going to interact with their devices? Just any color you could give would be great.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">The number of people using it already is amazing, and the questions and so forth and the personality that it has is also incredible. And so we see this as a profound innovation. And I think over time, many, many people will use it in a substantial way. And what percentage of their input will be by that, I don't know. And what percentage of their searches, I don't know. But our guts have been since the beginning of this is that it is substantial and it's an incredible innovation, and that's the feedback that we're getting from customers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Shannon S. Cross</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. Great. And then can you make a comment just on the supply chain given the HDD issues in Thailand? What are your thoughts -- any clarity you've gotten from the people on the ground there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">It's a very good question. Our hearts go out to all the people in Thailand who have experienced these devastating losses of life and property as a result of the monsoons and the flooding. Like many others, we source many components from Thailand and have multiple factories that supply these components. There are several factories that are currently not operable, and the recovery timeline for these factories is not known at this point. As you can appreciate, the weather really hasn't allowed an ability to assess those. From the work that we have done, we would say that our primary exposure is on the Mac because as you point out, of the number of drives or drive components that are sourced in or -- Thailand is a significant portion of the total of worldwide supply of drives. And so I can't give you a precise accounting. It is something that I'm concerned about. We do expect -- I'm virtually certain there will be an overall industry shortage of disk drives as a result of the disaster. How it affects Apple? I'm not sure, but we placed our assessment to the degree that we can make one in the guidance that Peter has already given you in the $37 billion number.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>A.M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Tim, I'm wondering if you can comment on your ongoing patent disputes most notably versus Samsung and other Android OEMs? Specifically, I'm wondering if you can characterize what your ultimate objectives are from litigation. Is it to get injunctions on violating products? Is it to capture royalty fees? Or what is it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Toni, I don't want to comment on any particular litigation. It's our policy not to do that. But basically as you know, we spend a lot of time and money and resource in coming up with incredible innovations, and we don't like it when someone else takes those. And so that's why we -- unfortunately, we've been pushed into the court system as a remedy to that, but I don't want to comment about any particular lawsuit.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>A.M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Just, I mean, generally speaking, you said as a remedy. What kinds of remedies do you see coming from the court system?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">That's one of the things I particularly don't want to comment on.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>A.M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about the price reductions on the 3GS offering. You've gone to free on postpaid and dramatically reduced the price $160 to $200 in most countries on the prepaid offering. Do you -- how are you thinking about this price reduction in terms of its potential elasticity? Do you see it as targeting a new segment of consumers? And how are you thinking about whether this will largely resonate with prepaid customers or with postpaid customers?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">We did it because we wanted to make the iPhone more accessible to a broader market. And so not only did we take the 3GS to free on a postpaid basis and that's the U.S., but it's free on postpaid in many, many other markets as well. But we also lowered the price of the iPhone 4 to $99. And so we've done both of those because as we looked at it, these are still fantastic products, and we think that we can do reasonably well selling those in the postpaid markets. It also has the advantage of having a lower price in the prepaid markets. Obviously not free and $99, but lower than where those entry points were previously. And so we did it for both markets, Toni, both the postpay and the prepay markets. Both of those are very, very important to us, and it has been our thinking for a while to do that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">From Citi, we'll hear from Richard Gardner.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Richard Gardner - Citigroup Inc, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Tim, as a follow-up to Shannon's question, I was hoping that you might be willing to give us a more general view of how you view component supply demand and pricing going into the fourth quarter. And then also, particularly unibody casings given the issues that you've had with one of your suppliers in that area as well, do you expect that to have any significant impact on MacBook Pro or MacBook Air supply in the fourth quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">On the second question first, we treat every concern that we hear about our suppliers very, very seriously, and we're currently investigating and assessing the situation. And we factored our supply outlook as we currently see it into the numbers that Peter has given earlier. In terms of the general market for components, NAND and DRAM, which really declined last quarter and LCDs, we see all 3 of these generally in a very positive supply situation and therefore, we expect the pricing to continue at favorable levels. Most of the other components we expect to fall at or above historical trends. And so generally speaking, it's a very positive market from a supply point of view. Now that is with the asterisk of the disaster that just happened in Thailand aside, and I'm not sure how that will play out. But I do believe that the risk there is more focused on the Mac portion of our product line.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Richard Gardner - Citigroup Inc, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. And if I could ask a follow-up, I guess, for Peter and Tim. I know you don't give operating margin guidance or gross margin guidance. But it does seem like we could be moving it to a new phase for the company where potentially, several of the fastest growing products in the product line, whether it be iPad or these lower priced iPhones that could see some good price elasticity at the low end, could be the fastest growing products for the company next year and could start to put some pressure on gross margins. I'm just wondering if you, a, agree with that assertion. And b, if that is the case, is it still reasonable to think that the company can maintain or expand operating margins next year if gross margins come under pressure due to product mix?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Rich, it's Peter. Let me make some comments about the December quarter, and then I'll give you more of our philosophy beyond. We're not providing future quarter or future year guidance. For the December quarter, we anticipate our gross margin being about 40% and having nice leverage on OpEx yielding an operating margin of just over 31%, which would be quite strong. As we look forward, we are going to continue to offer the very best products to customers that we can. We are going to be extremely innovative. We're very confident and excited about what's in the product pipeline. You'll see us be aggressive in the future. And where customers want to buy, that's fine with us. We just want them to buy our products. As I look back over the last couple of years, I think we've done a very good job gaining market share and growing our top and bottom lines and running a great business, and we're just going to keep coming to work every day to do that in the future.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We'll go to </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Kulbinder Garcha - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I've got just one clarification, one question. On the iPad side, could you just speak about where we are on the distribution rollout of that product, in particular, where we are on countries and carriers and point of sales? And was there any pause around that in the September quarter? And then a question for Tim. Tim, you mentioned just the growth not only in China but also the potential that may exist in Brazil and Middle East and Russia, and I guess you could throw India in there as well. What do you practically need to do to actually realize the potential there? Is that a case of local manufacturing in some of those countries? Is it a case of carrier distribution? And how long might it take to realize that? Because I understand the focus now is on China, but I'm trying to understand what Apple needs to do to realize the potential of the emerging middle class in those countries as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes, we are in 90 countries on iPad. We have about 40,000 points of sale around the world. To put that in some context, we have about 50,000 on iPod and about 120,000 on iPhone. So you can get a feel for the extent of the rollout there. There are still countries left to do, but we are in the main countries with iPad. Do I think there was a slowdown on iPad? Where the iPhone numbers, it's crystal clear in looking at the numbers that there was a slowdown. That is not the case on iPad. And so where I believe we are from a supply-demand point of view on iPad is that we, somewhere during the quarter, entered a supply-demand balance and stayed there for the balance of the quarter. If you recall on the last call, I said that we were coming in balance in a few countries. And then sometime thereafter, I think that we went into a supply-demand balance around the world. And you can look at the share numbers that third parties have reported, and we're doing extremely well there. We feel -- we couldn't feel better honestly. And the extent of the usage, the comScore group said that 97% of the web usage of tablets in the U.S. is from the iPad, so it's just mind-boggling. So we feel very, very good about that. In terms of the other countries outside of China, we have already started placing efforts in the places that I mentioned. It's not something that we are going to start next week or so. It's something we've already done or I wouldn't have brought it up, frankly. Obviously, we wouldn't have done over $900 million in Brazil with no effort. There are some countries in the world that have protectionalist type of structures where the prices of the goods are extremely high if there's not local content involved. And so we'll assess each of those and decide what's in our best interest. But today, I don't have anything to report there. The basic approach in all of the countries are the same as the game plan that we used in China, and it's just a matter of the course, the rate and pace of the rollout and whether to involve every one of the things that we did in China. In China, we picked everything that we knew to do. We are building retail. We went in with an online store. We're building an APR channel. We're building a third-party channel. We're doing significant advertising. We're really doing everything basically that we're doing in the United States, we're doing in China. We would not be doing that in each of the other countries I named, but we would be doing portions of that and have already started to achieve the numbers that we did last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">From Bank of America Merrill Lynch, we'll go to Scott Craig.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Scott D. Craig - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Tim, I was wondering first call as CEO, any thoughts on, any different strategy as far as cash allocation goes? And by that, I mean, dividend and a possible share buyback and maybe talk about these supplier investments also. And then the second question is, you mentioned the tablet market potentially being even bigger than the PC market at some point. Can you discuss the cannibalization levels that you think you're seeing right now versus the PC market?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Let me start with the second question first. I do believe that we're seeing cannibalization. I think that it's showing up in 2 ways. I think that some people are electing to buy an iPad rather than a Mac. However, I believe a materially larger number of people are electing to buy an iPad instead of a Windows-based PC. And so I think we are overwhelmingly coming out very, very well in that cannibalization question. And I would point out that despite that, the Mac had its best quarter by far ever last quarter. And so even with having the best quarter on iPad with some cannibalizations in Mac, the Mac has its best quarter ever, which is almost unbelievable. And so with cannibalization like this, I hope it continues. On your cash question, to date as you know, we've wanted to maintain flexibility. I think everyone that knows us knows that the cash isn't burning a hole in our pocket and we're not the type of people to do silly things with it. We invest it conservatively. If you look at Gary and his team's track record, they've done a phenomenal job in a extremely difficult market for the last few years. We've also taken money and done things with it that are in Apple's best interest. For example, we've acquired several companies. We've acquired some IP as you know. We've invested in the supply chain, and we used money to build out our stores and provide for a lot of new product tooling and the like. And so I believe what we're doing with cash, the way we're -- this cash that we do spend we're doing an extremely good job of it and we're very frugal about using it and using it in the right places. That said, I'm not religious about holding cash or not holding it. I'm religious about a lot of things but not that one. And so we will continually ask ourselves what's in Apple's best interest and always do what we believe is in Apple's best interest. And so it's a topic for the board on an ongoing basis, and we'll continue to discuss it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Scott, I'd like to add to Tim's answer, just to remind everybody that of the little over $81 billion of cash that we ended in the September quarter with, a bit more than $54 billion or 2/3 of that was offshore.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">From RBC Capital Markets, we'll hear from Mike Abramsky.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Mike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Tim, just following up on your last question, maybe I'll just ask this just absolutely directly. Is buying back shares with your cash, which seems to be sort of the thing that everybody wants you to do, at least certain investors want you to do it, is that perhaps kind of a philosophical white flag that you're not able to create value through product innovation?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Mike, I think anyone looking at us and the track record that we've got would not come to any conclusion that we're waving a white flag on innovation. We've had a series of unbelievable products that we believe the best products in the world and our customers tell us that, which is more importantly than us saying it, and we've got a pipeline that's unbelievable.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Mike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Sorry, Tim. I didn't mean to convey that you were doing that. I meant to say that would that be holding you back philosophically from buying back shares?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">No, I view those to be totally separate and distinct things. So no, I don't believe it sends that -- it certainly doesn't send that signal from my point of view. The cash is always a topic, and we'll always conclude to do what we think is in Apple's best interest. And I think we've done that so far, and if you look at where we've spent it, I think it's -- I think you would agree.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Mike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. And then the original goal for the iPhone, at the time it was obviously classed as audacious, with 1% of the market in the first fiscal year after launch. And you achieved 5x that, Tim. In the recent presentation when you highlighted that, there's 95% of the market to go. I'm wondering if in your minds you have established a similarly audacious goal for the next couple of years for market penetration.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Not one that I published, but we want the iPhone to be in as many customers' hands as possible because we think it's the greatest phone by far. And that's why we live to do that. And so yes, we aspire to much larger volumes than where we are. And we think the smartphone market will eventually absorb the handset market. As I made a point in that presentation, the handset market is this huge market. It's 1.5 billion handsets. And the smartphone market, depending upon which service you believe, is a bit over 400 million or so. And so there's a huge growth in the smartphone market, and then we think that we can also grow within the sector at all. But the big win is to eat into the 1.5 billion and not just for us but I think for others as well, and we are very focused on doing that. You can tell that with the moves that we've made recently.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">We'll go to Keith Bachman with the Bank of Montr\u00e9al.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I have 2. Peter, first for you. Is the extra week for the quarter truly linear on both the revenues and the expenses? And included, the reason I'm asking is just trying to set up, if you will, for the March quarter, the potential impact of that extra week on the March quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Sure, Keith. The 14th week will conclude on New Year's Eve day, which has traditionally been a good sell-through week for us but not typically as strong as the weeks between Thanksgiving and Christmas day. We'll provide further details on our January call about what we actually saw. That's some indication in terms of what we would see for sell-through. For our expenses, we certainly will have variable expenses and payroll expenses for that 14th week. But some of our fixed cost such as leases and rents and such are fixed, so there will be a benefit there as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. And my follow-up is on Japan. In terms of the year-over-year and sequential changes, there was a bigger disparity on units versus revenues, CPU units versus total revenues in Japan. I was just wondering if you could speak to that if you could.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I'm sorry?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">In terms of the revenue performance in Japan, it looked to be a bigger disparity between the units and the revenues than was true in the other regions. I was just wondering why the bigger disparity in Japan. Was it FX, or was it other reasons?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">A huge percentage of Japan's total revenue in the year-ago quarter was from the iPhone 4 launch. It was iPhone 4's first quarter as you know. And so when you do a year-over-year compare, that adversely affects the revenue compare. The Mac, however, had an incredible quarter growing at 48% in a market that is barely growing at all. And so we gained significant share on the Mac side of the business. The iPhone was a negative year-over-year compare, but we have gotten off to an unbelievable start in Japan. It was one of the first 7 countries, and it's very clear that Japan is yet another example of the delay that we were speaking about earlier.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. So the sequential was then there was perhaps a larger delay in Japan for the iPhone 4S than other regions. Is that the way to think about it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Think about it that iPhone is a bigger portion of the revenue [indiscernible].</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And that will come from Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Tim, I wanted to ask about the medium to longer term iPad opportunity as you see it from an ASP standpoint or segmentation standpoint. And by that, I mean, do you see more opportunity to move that product downmarket to drive elasticity, or upmarket to take on more of the -- or greater percentage on the PC market?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I don't want to get into what we might do, which that answer might do. But let me just go back to -- we see the tablet market as a huge market, and we could not be happier with our position in it. And we've got some fantastic things in the pipeline. And after selling 40 million in the first 18 months, which is more than our wildest dreams were and selling 3 out of every 4, I think we've got a fairly good handle on what to do next.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. Perhaps I can ask an initial feedback or expectations around the lower price points of the iPhone business into emerging markets. Can you comment at all or give some color on carrier receptivity of that pricing change and any acceleration in carrier engagements on the back of that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Let me -- maybe I can answer that in 2 ways. If you look at the channel inventory on iPhone that was there at the end of Q4, and so this is at the September 24 cutoff point for our quarter, that was the 5.75 million that Peter mentioned in his opening comments. Over half of that has already sold through. And so one portion of the things driving that is the elasticity question that you're getting at there. We also did in a very few countries last quarter, we dropped the 3GS price a bit early particularly in some of the prepaid markets to see what would occur on those markets, and we were extremely pleased with the results. It gave us even more conviction to follow through with the plan change that we made earlier in October.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Thank you, Chris.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking today is Apple CFO, Peter Oppenheimer. And he'll be joined by Apple CEO, Tim Cook; and Treasurer, Gary Wipfler, for the Q&amp;A session with the analysts.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, stock-based compensation expense, taxes, earnings per share and future products. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2011 and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today along with the attached press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">I'd now like to turn the call over to Peter Oppenheimer for introductory remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you, Nancy. We are thrilled to report the results of a tremendous quarter, generating the highest quarterly revenue and earnings in Apple's history. We established numerous new records during the quarter, including all-time highs for quarterly iPhone, iPad and Mac sales. We are very proud of these results and are extremely pleased with the momentum of our business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Revenue for the quarter was $46.3 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 73%. The increase was fueled primarily by strong growth in iPhone, iPad and Mac sales, and was also aided by the inclusion of a 14th week in the quarter, which we indicated previously.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Operating margin was $17.3 billion, representing 37.4% of revenue. Net income was $13.1 billion, increasing 118% over the prior December quarter's results, and equaling half of the net income generated in all of fiscal 2011. The quarter's net income translated to earnings per share of $13.87.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Turning to the details of the quarter. I'd like to begin with our Mac products and services. We established a new all-time quarterly record with sales of 5.2 million Macs, setting new records for both desktops and portables. Mac sales grew 26% year-over-year compared to IDC's latest published forecast of 0 growth for the market overall in the December quarter. While total Mac sales benefited from the 14th week, average weekly Mac sales were up strongly year-over-year across the quarter. Mac sales outgrew the market in each of our geographies with particular strength in our Asia-Pacific segment where sales were up 58% year-over-year. The increase in Mac sales was fueled by very strong growth of MacBook Pro and MacBook Air, as well as the continued strong performance of iMac. We began and ended the quarter with between 3 and 4 weeks of Mac channel inventory on a look-forward basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">As we announced last month, the Mac App Store has been a great success with customers downloading over 100 million apps in less than a year. The Mac App Store offers thousands of apps in education, games, graphics and design, lifestyle, productivity, utilities and other categories, and has rapidly become a favorite shopping destination for Mac software.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Moving to our music products. We sold 15.4 million iPods compared to 19.4 million in the year-ago quarter. Total iPod sales were ahead of our expectations and iPod touch continued to account for over half of all iPods sold. iPod share of the U.S. market for MP3 players remains at over 70% based on the latest monthly data published by MPD. And iPod continued to be the top-selling MP3 player in most countries we track based on the latest data published by GFK.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We ended the quarter within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPod channel inventory on a look-forward basis. The iTunes Store generated record results with revenue in the quarter of $1.7 billion. During the quarter, we launched iTunes music stores in Brazil as well as 27 other countries in Latin America and Europe, now offering a catalog of over 20 million songs from major recording labels, as well as thousands of independent artists. And iTunes customers were amazingly busy on December 25, generating over 140 million downloads of apps and content that day.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">I'd now like to turn to iPhone. We were thrilled to sell a record 37 million iPhones compared to 16.2 million in the previous December quarter. This represents 128% year-over-year growth compared to 40% growth for the smartphone market overall in the December quarter, based on the latest published estimate from IDC. We experienced very strong iPhone sales growth in all of our segments, thanks primarily to the tremendous popularity of iPhone 4S.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Customers have been captivated by Siri, which let's them use their voices to send messages, place phone calls, schedule appointments and more. Siri understands what users say, knows what they mean and helps them with everyday tasks and information requests. iPhone channel inventory increased sequentially by about 200k, leaving us with a little under 6 million iPhones in the channel at the end of the quarter, and below our target range of 4 to 6 weeks on a look-forward basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Recognized revenue from iPhone handset and accessory sales was $24.4 billion during the quarter compared to $10.5 billion in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 133%. Nearly all of the top companies in the Fortune 500 now approve and support iPhone on their networks. This includes companies in markets such as financial services, consumer products, transportation, healthcare and insurance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">iPhone is changing the way companies across the globe use mobile devices for work. In addition to accessing e-mail, calendar and contacts, many of these companies are developing and deploying mission-critical iPhone apps to help improve productivity and give employees secure and immediate access to information anywhere. Many companies around the world have thousands of employees using iPhone and business apps. Some new examples include Royal Dutch Shell, Credit Suisse, Kimberly-Clark, St. Jude Medical, Providian, Teradata, Nike, [indiscernible] and Facebook. We were very pleased to begin shipping iPhone 4S in China and 21 additional countries earlier this month. iPhone 4S is now available in over 90 countries, making this our fastest iPhone rollout ever.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Turning to iPad. We were very pleased with record sales of 15.4 million iPads during the December quarter compared to 7.3 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 111%. iPad was extremely popular with holiday season buyers, and we remain very excited about the potential for this market.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Recognized revenue from sales of iPad and iPad accessories during the quarter increased by 99% year-over-year to over $9.1 billion compared to $4.6 billion in the year-ago quarter. iPad sales surpassed our expectations with sell-through exceeding sell-in by about 200,000 units. We exited the quarter within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPad channel inventory on a look-forward basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">iPad continues its unprecedented adoption in business. Nearly all of the top companies within major Fortune 500 markets including pharma, manufacturing, hospitality, consumer products, financial services, healthcare and retail are actively using iPad to improve workflows, business processes and customer engagements. We are delighted to learn how iPad enables businesses to change the way they work. Real estate agents at Coldwell Banker and Sotheby's access sales presentations and use custom iPad apps in the field. Retail chains such as Bed Bath &amp; Beyond use iPads to deliver key business metrics on the sales floor. Wineries are using iPads in their vineyards to call up weather data and soil profiles, record quality assessments and make decisions on the spot about whether to harvest their grapes. And in this past quarter, Chinese airline, EVA, has also deployed iPads to pilots and crew for flight manuals, documentation and training. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">iPad is extremely popular with students, teachers and administrators as a wonderfully engaging and powerful tool for teaching and learning. Today, 1.5 million iPads are already in use in education institutions, including over 1,000 one-to-one deployments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We were very pleased to announce iBooks 2 last week featuring iBook Textbooks to deliver educational content that is more interactive, current and portable than ever from leading publishers, including Houghton Mifflin, McGraw-Hill and Pearson, as well as thousands of independent publishers. And with iBooks Author, anyone with a Mac can create iBook textbooks, cookbooks, picture books and more, and publish them to Apple's iBook Store. And over 600,000 copies of iBooks Author have already been downloaded since last Thursday's announcement.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We were also happy to announce the all-new iTunes U App last week, allowing students using iPads to have access to the world's largest catalog of free educational content, along with over 20,000 education apps and hundreds of thousands of books in the iBookstore that can be used in their school curriculum. And as of today, over 3 million copies of iTunes U App have already been downloaded.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Combining iPhone, iPad and iPod touch, we surpassed 315 million cumulative iOS device sales, selling more than 62 million in the December quarter. We were very pleased to launch iOS 5 and iCloud during the quarter. Customers are loving the new features of iOS 5, including Notification Center, iMessage and Reminders. And iCloud is off to a great start with more than 85 million customers signed up as of today. With iCloud, customers can store their music and photos and documents and keep their personal information and content in sync across all their devices, automatically and seamlessly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">The App Store continues to be incredibly successful with over 550,000 apps available, including 170,000 apps specifically for iPad. We are thrilled that by the end of this month, our developers will have earned over $4 billion cumulatively from App Store sales, including over $700 million in the December quarter alone. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">I'd now like to turn to the Apple retail stores, which also generated record results. Revenue was $6.1 billion, an increase of 59% over the prior year. The stores experienced very strong year-over-year growth in iPhone, iPad and Mac sales, establishing new records for all 3. iPhone sales were extremely robust, more than doubling year-over-year thanks primarily to the very successful launch of the iPhone 4S.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Sales of iPad were also up significantly year-over-year, thanks to continued strength of iPad 2 and strong holiday season buying. The stores also sold 1.1 million Macs compared to 851,000 in the year-ago quarter. And about half the Macs sold in our stores during the December quarter were to customers who had never owned a Mac before.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We opened 4 new stores in the quarter, including our spectacular new store at Grand Central, as well as 3 stores in Europe, bringing us to a total of 361 stores. With an average of 358 stores open, average revenue per store was $17.1 million compared to $12 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 43%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Segment margin reached a new record of over $1.8 billion and 30.3% of retail revenue compared to $1 billion and 26.2% in the year-ago quarter. Store traffic reached new record levels with 110 million visitors compared to 76 million visitors in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 45%. That translates to an average of almost 22,000 visitors per store per week, reflecting incredible interest in our stores and our products.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Our EasyPay checkout process has significantly enhanced our ability to handle such high customer traffic levels. And now, with personal pick up, customers can order Macs, iPods or iPads from the Apple online store and pick up most in-stock products within 1 hour at the Apple Retail Store of their choice, making shopping for Apple products that much easier and faster.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Total company gross margin was 44.7%, which was 470 basis points higher than our guidance. About half of this difference was driven by lower commodity and other product costs. Another quarter was due to leverage on the higher revenue and some onetime items benefiting the quarter. And the remainder was due to better-than-expected mix largely from the record iPhone sales.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Operating expenses were $3.36 billion, and included $357 million in stock-based compensation expense. OI&amp;E was $137 million, and the tax rate for the quarter was 25.25%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to our cash. Our cash for short-term and long-term marketable securities totaled $97.6 billion at the end of the December quarter compared to $81.6 billion at the end of September quarter, a sequential increase of $16 billion. About $64 billion of the cash was offshore at the end of the December quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Cash flow from operations was over $17.5 billion. We are actively discussing uses of our cash balance and don't have anything specific to announce today. In the meantime, we continue to be very disciplined with the cash and are not letting it burn a hole in our pockets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As we move ahead into the March quarter, which will be 13-week quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We expect revenue to be about $32.5 billion, compared to $24.7 billion in the March quarter last year. We expect gross margin to be about 42%, reflecting approximately $60 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be about $3.05 billion, including about $350 million related to stock-based compensation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We expect OI&amp;E to be about $125 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 25.25%. We are targeting EPS of about $8.50.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In closing, we are extremely pleased with customer response to our products and the record-breaking results in the December quarter. We launched iPhone 4S to rave reviews, delivered iOS and iCloud to millions of customers and surpassed all previous records for quarterly iPhone, iPad and Mac sales. We are very proud to be delivering the strongest product lineup in Apple's history and we are extremely enthusiastic about our new product pipeline.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p4\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Thank you, Peter. [Operator Instructions]</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">[Operator Instructions] And your first question will come from Ben Reitzes of Barclays.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Tim and Peter, can you describe the iPhone momentum as you ended the quarter? And what is included for the iPhone in your guidance and your enthusiasm for the product as we head into the first half of the calendar year? Any more detail in metrics would be helpful.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Sure, Ben. This is Tim. We were thrilled with the 37 million iPhones that we sold. It's up 128% against a market rate of growth of about 40%, according to IDC's latest projection. And this is substantially above the 20 million unit previous record. We would attribute it to a -- just a breathtaking customer reception of the iPhone 4S with iOS 5, and key features such as Siri and this incredible camera with advanced optics. Customers are absolutely loving this product. We also attribute it to -- we made a very bold bet entering the quarter as to what the demand would be. And as it turns out, despite it being a very bold bet, we were short of supply throughout the quarter and did end with a significant backlog as Peter has said. That situation has improved some since the end of the quarter, but we still are short in some key geographies currently. I would also attribute the performance to the delayed purchases from the prior quarter as we discussed in the October call as the -- people were anticipating a new iPhone being announced. I think we made the correct decision to go with a broad range of iPhones. It turned out to be a benefit as we thought it would. And of course, the 14th week, as Peter said, is a part of this, although everyone knew that, as we did as well, and factored that into our guidance. Geographically, we saw strength in literally in every key region. But in particular, I would call out that U.S. and Japan, which got billing early in the quarter and had most sale -- many more sales days than most countries. I would also say that was particularly huge with the iPhone sales in Greater China, particularly considering that we did not launch the iPhone 4S in China until in January. And therefore, had no sales into mainland China during last quarter. And so we could not be happier. We felt we were betting bold, as I think many of you would have thought if you would have known what we were doing. But as it turns out, we didn't bet high enough. Our customers are loving iPhone and we're very happy with that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">My follow-up is, as we're doing the math here, it seems like the ASP is up sequentially for the iPhone. So it seems like there was a very good mix of the 4S and the higher capacity 4S, could you just comment a little bit on that versus the iPhone 4 which you cut the price of?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">The iPhone 4S was the most popular iPhone during the quarter. And consistent with most launches, we typically see a higher mix of the front end of the launch.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Next, we'll go to Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Just a follow-up on the iPhone discussion. Tim, can you talk about whether the pent-up demand at the end of December and today -- is both countries like U.S. and Japan that had the phone all quarter? Or is it just countries that recently received and are able to sell the phone? So if can you talk about that, and then the second part would be, does the component environment and your production capacity or your suppliers' capacity allow you to start to address that catch-up demand, address China, which is new this quarter, and also help you start to rebuild inventory in March? Or are there any constraints that you see in the near term?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">I don't want to comment on current sales trends other than -- because we have included, obviously, that in our guidance. But I would -- given that we just launched in China, I would say the demand there has been staggering. We are selling through our reseller stores and our online store. We're not currently selling through a retail store. And the demand is off the charts. And so we're very happy with the demand response there. The other countries that we launched in earlier this quarter were smaller countries in a demand sense. And so we'll see how the quarter goes from a supply-demand point of view. We did make progress as we moved from the end of the quarter until now, as I alluded to earlier, and got caught up in some countries, but there is still some that we are not caught up. So we'll see how we'll do going forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">In terms of the component environment, generally speaking, the component environment is favorable. That was one of the things that allowed us to overachieve on gross margin. And we would predict that, that component environment stays favorable on most key commodities with the exception of hard drives which, as you know, was very much affected by the tragic situation in Thailand. And I don't predict Apple having a material supply issue during the quarter, but we will pay more for drives during the quarter. And that's reflected in our guidance that Peter gave earlier.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">From Citi, we'll go to Richard Gardner.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Richard Gardner - Citigroup Inc, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">I was actually going to ask about the hard drive situation. I'd love to just get a little bit more detail there in terms of whether it did have any sort of meaningful impact on Mac sales during the December quarter? Tim and -- you mentioned that you expect to pay more for drives. I guess you don't expect it to have any sort of impact on revenue for the March quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Yes, for the December quarter, Rich, there was not a material supply or cost impact to any of our product lines as a result of the -- for the March quarter, we're not expecting any material supply impact. However, in the hard drive area, prices have increased and we have included those cost increases in our guidance that Peter provided earlier.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Richard Gardner - Citigroup Inc, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay. And then for the December quarter, you obviously -- you saw some pretty dramatic declines in key components like NAND, down about 10% and DRAM down almost 40%. Can you talk about, within that context, how favorable you expect pricing to be for some of those key commodities here on the March quarter and whether the overall industry shortage of HDDs is having a material impact on pricing and other categories?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Yes. Last quarter -- not confirming the percentages that you gave out, but we did receive better costs than we had rolled in our guidance on -- particularly on displays and NAND Flash and DRAM. And we would expect that NAND, DRAM and most LCDs would continue to be in a position that supply exceeds demand for the industry, and therefore those price trends should continue to be favorable in this quarter and we reflected that in our guidance. The big exception is the hard drive, which I pointed out earlier, which is constrained on an industry-wide basis, and where I believe we can navigate the supply issue that we are paying more for them and that's rolled in our guidance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Rich, it's Peter. I'd like to just talk a little bit about the gross margin guidance to put the component environment in context. We do see that helping us sequentially in the March quarter. But overall, we would anticipate our gross margin to be down by about 270 basis points. And we see that largely coming from the loss of leverage on the sequentially lower revenue on the December to March quarter. The nonrecurrence of onetime items, which benefited us in the December quarter, and the stronger U.S. dollar that we've seen.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Richard Gardner - Citigroup Inc, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Since you touched on it, Peter, can you talk about how big the nonrecurring items were as a gross margin benefit in December?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Yes. They, along with the leverage, the 2 of those together represented about 1/4 of the upside that you saw to our guidance. About half of it came from better commodity and other product costs, and the remaining quarter came from better mix, largely the iPhone sales.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. Great. I have a question on the iPad. Obviously, a very strong shipment number for the December quarter. But with that said, did you see any impact at all from some of the new lower-priced tablets in the market? And I guess looking forward into 2012, how do you think about competition from the lower-priced content, subsidized tablets like that of Amazon's models in 2012?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">We're really happy with the 15.4 million iPads that we were able to sell. And as Peter said, we did take down the channel inventory slightly. There's the -- underlying sell through was slightly higher than that. This is consistent with our long-term beliefs that we've had since -- before we introduced the product, that this is a huge opportunity for Apple over time. And as I've said before, I truly believe, and many others in the company believe, that there will come a day that the tablet market and units is larger than the PC market. In fact, it's interesting to note that in the U.S., it's clear from the IDC's recent data on desktop PCs in the U.S., that tablets exceeded desktop PC sales last quarter in the U.S. And so I think you can already see different indicators that there is significant momentum in this space. In terms of our competitiveness, the ecosystem for iPad is in a class by itself. We strongly believed in optimizing applications from day one to take advantage of the larger canvas, and we now have apps totaling over 170,000 available for customers. And that compares to what appears to us to be only a few hundred for the competition. And so I think people really want to do multiple things with their tablets. And therefore, we don't really see these limited function tablets and e-readers being in the same category. There is clearly customers that will buy those. I think they'll sell a fair number of units. But I don't think that people that want an iPad will settle for a limited function.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And in terms of other tablets, last year was supposed to be the year of the tablet. I think most people would agree, it was the year of the iPad for the second year in a row. And so we're just going to continue to innovate like crazy in this area. And we think we can continue to compete with anyone that is currently shipping tablets or that might enter in the future.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. Great. And then, I guess digging into the iPhone number a bit more, you gave us a lot of great color on that performance, but could you dig in a bit more to what your learning in terms of iPhone elasticity with the new price points for the 3GS, I guess in both the post and prepaid markets? And I know in the past, you've talked about the iPhone and the prepaid market that sort of an evolving strategy that you all were approaching with sort of an open mind. How are you thinking about that now that you've had a full quarter with these lower price points and obviously, some success there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Each of the models, the 3GS, the iPhone 4 and the iPhone 4S, were important in achieving the 37 million total units. And so we're glad to cover the broad range with great products. But the iPhone 4S was clearly the most popular among those. In the postpaid markets, as you know, there's a much smaller difference between what the customer pays in each of these. It's larger in the prepaid markets, and so it's too early to tell given we just started this October as to how this will play out over time. But we're thrilled with the total result, and you can bet that we're into details in every single country in the world trying to learn what we can learn to adjust and even do better in the future.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">From Sanford Bernstein, we'll hear from Toni Sacconaghi.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>A.M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Peter, Tim, I'd like to follow up on your comment that you're actively discussing, uses of cash. Is that any different, quite frankly, than what you've been doing historically? Or is that statement meant to suggest that you're thinking more constructively about cash than you have historically?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Tony, it's Peter. We have always discussed, internally as a management team and with our board, our cash. We recognize that the cash is growing for all the right reasons and I would characterize our discussions today as active about what makes the most sense to do with the cash balance, but we don't have anything to announce specifically today.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>A.M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Is there a timeframe or will you actually tell us that you've finished those discussions? Or is there a process for which there is an ending and you will inform us about that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">When we have something to announce, Tony, we will announce it. But I want to say again that we are actively discussing the best uses of our cash balance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>A.M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And then on my follow-up, I was wondering, I want to revisit the gross margin question. I think in each of the last 10 years, your gross margin has actually gone up from Q1 to Q2. I think the last 3 years, which is more representative of your mix, it's kind of been going up by 200 basis points. So by saying it's going to go down 270 basis points, that's kind of bucking normal seasonality by 400 to 500 basis points, sounds like the onetime items is about 50 basis points. Is the loss of leverage that significant? Or what am I missing?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">The factors that are -- Tony, that are going to affect our sequential decline are primarily 3. They are the loss of leverage from the revenue, so we reported $46.3 billion this quarter, which included a 14th week. We see our revenues being $32.5 billion next quarter. So against our fixed cost that will have a significant impact. We did have some onetime items in the December quarter which won't recur, and the dollar is much stronger. So those are the principal 3 reasons. I would also say that 44.7 is a high, high, higher than we have seen since I've been with Apple in 15 years. And it's hard to compare this year versus last because we're in different commodity cycles and different currency levels and where we are with our product cycles as well. Last year, we did have a sequential increase in iPhones, and that was a big contributor to our going up sequentially. We don't see that reoccurring  this year, especially from the high of $44.7 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">We'll go to Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Charles Eugene Munster - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So we just got back from CES and everyone has a connected TV, trying to solve problems that only Apple can solve, and yet when we look at your Apple TV offering, it seems a little dated compared to what's on the market. So just from a high level, how should we be thinking about your strategy in the living room?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Gene, it's Tim. The Apple TV product is doing actually very well. In last fiscal year that ended in September, we sold a bit above 2.8 million units. And just in the past quarter, the December quarter, we set a new quarterly record for Apple TV at over 1.4 million. But in the scheme of things, if you dollarize this in revenue that -- we still classify this as a hobby. However, we continue to add things to it and if you're using the latest one, I don't know about you, but I couldn't live without it. And so I think it's a fantastic product. And we continue to pull the string to see where it takes us. But other than that, I don't have any comments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>A.M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. And then Tim, you've been CEO for 4 months now, and I wonder what your early read on your new job has been. Has anything surprised you? Have you ever come across anything that you didn't expect?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I love Apple, and it's just a reminder everyday of how much of a privilege it is to work with a team of people that are so incredible, and how lucky I am.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Charles Eugene Munster - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">But from like a strategic standpoint or anything that you can add as far as your first 4 months?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">No, you can see the -- our results. And I think the team is doing a fantastic job. We feel very good about where we are.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Next, we'll go to Keith Bachman with the Bank of Montr\u00e9al.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Peter, to start with you, when you talked about the cash balances, that you'll announce something when you announce it. But could you give us a little perspective on how at least you're framing the differences, opportunities in terms of dividends and buybacks?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Keith, we're examining all uses of our cash balance, what we might do in the supply chain, what we can do from an acquisition perspective and otherwise. Since I don't have any perspective to share with you today, specifically on dividends or buybacks, other than again, we are actively discussing the cash balance. And in the meantime, we're not letting it burn a hole in our pockets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Tim, then, try one for you. One thing you didn't mention much in your prepared remarks and subsequent questions was discussions around iCloud. And I just wanted to try to get some perspective: a, what's your perception on how it's adding value to Apple's products; and then b, as importantly, what are the metrics that you guys are using to determine if it indeed is driving success surrounding the various products?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I think Peter shared earlier the number of customers that had signed up for iCloud, and it's already over 85 million. So it's incredible that this has happened just in -- just a few months, period of time. We're thrilled with it, and the response customers has been incredible. It's solved a lot of problems that customers were having and made their lives incredible, much, much easier. And so I see it as a -- it was a fundamental shift recognizing that people had numerous devices and they wanted the bulk of their content in the cloud, and easily accessible from all the devices. And I think we're seeing the response from that, and with 85 million customers in just 3 months, it is a very, very important part. It's just not a product. It's a strategy for the next decade.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">That comes from Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I wanted to ask about iPhone distribution in the quarter, and outlook for distribution as we move forward over the next several quarters. Can you give us an update in terms of where you are in distribution for the phone? And in terms of China, what are the prospects for expanding your reach from a carrier standpoint in China over the next couple of quarters?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">We are now over 130,000 points of sale throughout the world. That's up about 35% on a year-over-year basis. And so we have consistently added points of distribution. That's both adding carriers that have captured distribution, our own distribution as well as key retailers, which are particularly important in some markets. We added carriers last quarter with KDDI in Japan and Sprint in the United States. And both of those carriers, they can speak for their own results, but we are extremely pleased with both companies, and while the incumbents that were in the market also did incredibly well. And in terms of China, China Unicom continues to be a very key partner. I've got nothing to announce today on an expansion there. But as I consistently said, China is an extremely important market for us, and we continue to look at how to grow it further.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. And for my follow-up, I wanted to ask about your revenue guidance for the March quarter. If you assume kind of weekly sales are adjust for the 14th week, it looks like you're guiding revenue down to about 25% quarter-on-quarter. However, you started the quarter with a pretty significant backlog of iPhones, et cetera, pretty strong momentum. Why would revenue be down more than normal seasonal or just historical seasonal end of March?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Chris, this is Peter, I'll take that. Let me first start with units and then I'll talk about some points on revenue. iPhone, we would expect to have a significant year-over-year increase and be down sequentially, as we reported from the 14-week December quarter. For iPad, we would expect to have a significant year-over-year increase, and also be down sequentially as reported from the 14-week December quarter and the end of the gift-giving season. And for Mac and iPod, we would expect to be down sequentially consistent with our typical seasonality. From a revenue perspective, I completely understand the question that you're asking, and I want to talk to you about 5 reasons why I expect the -- us to be down in greater percent sequentially this year than we were last.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">The first, the December quarter this year included a 14th week, which was the week between Christmas and New Year's. That week accounted for approximately 1/14 of the December quarter's revenue. Second, that week between Christmas and New Year's, fell within the March quarter last year and it will not be included this year. And sales in that week are typically greater than the average for the weekly sales in the March quarter. So when we think about our March quarter on a sequential basis, we would have loved to add that week in the quarter that we're now heading into. Last year, we increased the iPhone channel inventory by about 1.7 million units in the December quarter, so -- or this March quarter, so that benefited the quarter and reduced the comparable. The fourth, our December quarter results this fiscal year benefited from the launch of the iPhone 4S. We believe there were significant pent-up demand for the iPhone 4S heading into the December quarter, and it's been our fastest iPhone rollout ever. The previous iPhone launch took place at the end of June 2010. So in the year-ago December quarter marked the second full quarter of new iPhone availability. So we have some differences in launch timing. And finally, the U.S. dollar has strengthened in recent weeks, particularly against the euro, and we expect this to have an impact on our sequential compare. Last year, the dollar was relatively flat within the comparable time period. All that being said, we just reported an amazing quarter and we feel very good about the momentum of our business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We'll go to Shannon Cross with Cross Research.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Tim, I had a question -- and actually, Peter, I realize you're not going to talk specifically about cash, but with regard to acquisitions, perhaps you can talk a little bit about your strategy behind some other acquisitions including your most recent one, which was Anobit.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Shannon, we have done acquisitions where it tended be smaller or medium-sized companies that have just great engineering and other talent, a great start on a product or a technology that we'd like to bring in to Apple, and sometimes including the IP. And that's really the acquisitions that we've done. We tend to do several a year. We're very, very disciplined in how we think about this and how we do it. And I think our track record here has been very strong.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And can you talk a little bit about how they're integrated in? I'm just kind of curious as to -- since there's been several sort of semi-related acquisitions that you've made? I mean, do they sort of become encompassed within Apple or do you run them sort of as standalone divisions?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Shannon, we don't believe in lots of divisions like a lot of companies do. So we run the company as one instead of a lot of many companies. The semiconductor team works for Bob Mansfield, as does all of the hardware engineering for the whole company. And so Bob and his team are integrating Anobit into that team. Anobit has fantastic technical talent and we're really fortunate to have them join us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">From Credit Suisse, we'll hear from Kulbinder Garcha.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Kulbinder Garcha - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Both of my questions kind of link to geographic expansion, maybe for Tim. I take the point of your focus in China, but it's also like -- I think if given what you said, you may be at 230 or 235 carriers now. There's about 500 carriers in the world, and I was wondering what your ambitions are and what you think the reality is over the next 12 to 18 months of I think at least a sizable share of them. And I had similar question on geographic expansion, Tim, just in terms of country rollout, you seem to have at least addressed part of China on the retail side, and it sounds like Brazil is next. But when can we look forward, Tim, you maybe addressing markets like India or Russia more aggressively with your retail presence?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes, we are today selling in Brazil through online store and reseller partners, including some very key carrier partners. We're selling in Russia through carrier partners and reseller partners. And we're selling in India through some carrier partners and reseller partners. And so we're in all of those countries today. But I've tried to be very clear in the past, and I'll do so again, that we have a ton more energy in the China market today. That doesn't mean that there is a lack of effort or focus on the others. It just means that it's less than what we're investing in China today.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">On the second country on the list of those 4, for us, would be Brazil. I think there's a huge opportunity for us there, and we've more than begun to go deeper into Brazil. But I don't want to signal that, that means that Apple Retail would be there, because I don't envision that occurring in the near term. In India where it is small, the revenue went up over 3x last quarter, but that's on a small base. And so we're beginning to see traction in most of these, but we recognize we have to focus to deeply understand the point that we can really get to a large revenue figure like Greater China currently is.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">In terms of more carriers, we have been adding carriers. I anticipate we'll continue to add carriers. We have nothing specific to announce today, but you can bet that we're looking at the same list that you are. In terms of major carriers there, the number is much smaller than the number you quoted, as you know, there is a lot of smaller carriers on there. And the same thing with countries, there's many smaller countries. But all of those are important, I'd like to get into all of them over time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">From JPMorgan, we'll go to Mark Moskowitz.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Tim, I want to come back to the tablet market here. Obviously, the iPhone was scintillating in terms of the growth, but I think the iPad growth also really outpaced a lot of our expectations. And the question really is -- it's kind of a loaded question. The question is really around -- do you think that Apple actually benefited from some of these lower cost, reduced features that tablets come into the market, where folks came in to check them out and realized not really that good, so they trade up to the iPad? And do you see that may be happening as well with the MacBook Air this year? Because this year seems like to be the ultrabook's version of \"Let's try to be like Apple as well.\"</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Well, I looked at the data, particularly in the U.S. on a weekly basis, after Amazon launched the Kindle Fire. And I wouldn't, in my view, there wasn't an obvious effect on the numbers plus or minus. The theory that you've got, I have heard clearly from some customers that, that occurred, that they went in thinking that they would buy that, they'd look at it and decided to buy an iPad. Whether that's happening on a very, very large basis, I don't know. Again, my own view is looking at our data in the U.S., there was no obvious change in the data, for what it's worth. That's how I see it. There is cannibalization clearly of the Mac by the iPad, but we continue to believe there is much more cannibalization of Windows PCs by the iPad and there's many more of them to cannibalize. And so we love that trend. We think it's great for us. The thing that is very different about the iPad is you can see it beginning to appear virtually everywhere. The enterprise has adopted it in a very large percent of the Fortune 500, as Peter talked about earlier. That number is also quite large when you look at the Global 500. In education, in K-12, we sold twice the number of iPads as we did Macs. And generally speaking, education adopts new technologies fairly slowly, so that's somewhat surprising. And of course, the consumer is -- has moved in a huge way to iPad. And so it's winning market by market, by market. I think that consumers that go in and look at it and think about the ecosystem and the huge advantages and the overall customer experience, I think we will win a fair number of those. And I think you can see that in the results. And so we couldn't be happier with doing over 15 million. And I think it's remarkable that we sold over 55 million iPads, and we've only been in the business April of 2011, I think, when we shipped the first one -- or 2010, excuse me.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And then the other question I have is given your customer data, are you seeing any sort of phenomena now where, because of the accelerated refresh cycles, the widened gap in terms of what Apple has given to the customer base versus the competition's meager efforts, if you will? Are you seeing accelerated refresh rates within your customer base in terms of someone who buys an iPhone, maybe they're buying it quicker or maybe they're also buying now a MacBook Air or an iPad, do you see an accelerated refresh rate or a halo effect?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">In the enterprise space, we've seen -- as an example, we've seen iPhones sort of being a catalyst. And the iPad moves after the iPhone. And in several accounts, we've seen the Mac follow that. And so there are clear examples where one product has pulled the other. And at a macro level, how much it's happening, it's very difficult to put our fingers on, but many customers, consumers, enterprise, education, they're all pointing that out. And as you know, we've seen that phenomenon before with the halo that the iPod created for the Mac back at the early 2002, 2003, 2004 range. And so it's not a phenomenon that is new to us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Next, we'll go to Mike Abramsky with RBC Capital Markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Mike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Tim, Android versus iPhone. Is this, in your view, becoming a 2-horse race similar to Mac versus Windows? And how do you see the sustainability of your integrated model versus what happened in terms of the growth of the OEM model in the PC market?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I wouldn't classify it like Mac and Windows at all. The Mac has outgrown the market for over 20 quarters in a row, but still has a single-digit percentage of the worldwide market, where iOS, if you look at phones and tablets, and the iPod touch, we've sold over 315 million iOS devices. And so I think this compares very favorable to any comparison, and over 62 million of those were done in the last quarter alone. I don't have comparable numbers, Mike, on Android. I haven't found a way to get very crisp quarterly reporting like we do that is straightforward and transparent. However, you can see from a momentum point of view, if you look at the MPD data that just came out a few days ago, it shows in the U.S., and this is just looking at October, November and so this had part of our launch in October and then all of it in November, it shows that just the iPhones, looking at phones not total iOS, it shows iPhone at 43% and Android at 47%. The Nielsen data that just came out a few days ago shows iPhone in the October, November, December timeframe at 45% versus Android at 47%. And the comScore data that also came out on October, November shows iPhone at 42% versus Android at 41%. And so it seems like all of the data that I've seen in the U.S. would say that it's a very close race in iPhone.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I think on the iPad side, although I don't have specific numbers to share from third parties, I think that all of us inherently believe that iPad is way ahead there. And there's really no comparable products to the iPod touch out there. And so iOS is doing extremely well. I wouldn't say it's 2-horse race. There's a horse in Redmond that always suits up and always runs, and will keep running. And there's other players that we can never count out. And so what we focus on is innovating and making the world's best products. And we'll just keep on doing that and somewhat ignore how many horses there are. And we just want to stay ahead and be the lead one.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Mike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay, just as a quick follow-up. There's 2 developments in the market on -- in smartphones that you sort of haven't approached yet, but Android has at least approached, which would be 4G and larger screens. In the past, you've articulated a fairly firm view both on the iPad and the iPhone of display dimensions, for example, you mentioned that earlier in this call in iPad. Has the popularity, for example, of larger screens on Android phones changed or impacted, for example, your view? And same thing on 4G obviously, some of these phones have challenges to battery life, but what are your thoughts there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Well, I wouldn't comment on the future roadmap, I'm sure that's a shock to you. But I would point out that we just sold a record 37 million iPhones. And so I think there's an incredible number of people -- and we could have sold more if we would have had more supply. But there's a lot of people out there that really love what we're doing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">A replay of today's call will be available for 2 weeks at the Podcast on the iTunes Store, as a webcast on apple.com/investor and via telephone.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking today is Apple CFO, Peter Oppenheimer; and he'll be joined by Apple CEO, Tim Cook; and Treasurer, Gary Wipfler for the Q&amp;A session with analysts.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, stock-based compensation expense, taxes, earnings per share and future products. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2011, the Form 10-Q for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today along with the attached press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">I'd now like to turn the call over to Peter Oppenheimer for introductory remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you, Nancy. We're very pleased to report the results of our outstanding second fiscal quarter. We established new March quarter records for iPhone, iPad and Mac sales, leading to our highest March quarter revenue and earnings ever.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Revenue for the quarter was $39.2 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 59%. That's a new record for a March quarter and is second only to the all-time record revenue we reported in the most recent December quarter. The year-over-year increase in March quarter revenue was fueled primarily by very strong growth in iPhone and iPad sales.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Operating margin was $15.4 billion, representing 39.3% of revenue. Net income was $11.6 billion, increasing 94% over the prior March quarter's result. The quarter's net income translated to earnings per share of $12.30.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Turning to the details of the quarter, I'd like to begin with our Mac products and services. We established new March quarter records for both desktops and portables, combining for a total of 4 million Macs sold. This represents growth of 7% year-over-year compared to IDC's latest published forecast of 2% growth for the global personal computer market in the March quarter. We began and ended the quarter with between 3 and 4 weeks of Mac channel inventory, which is below our target range of 4 to 5 weeks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">In February, we released the developer preview of Mountain Lion, the ninth major release of Mac OS X. Mountain Lion will bring popular apps and features from iPad to the Mac, including Messages, Notes, Reminders, Game Center, Notification Center, Share Sheets, Twitter integration and AirPlay Mirroring. We expect Mountain Lion to be available from the Mac App Store in late summer this year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Moving to our music products. We sold 7.7 million iPods compared to 9 million in the year ago quarter. Total iPod sales were ahead of our expectations, and iPod touch continued to account for over half of all iPods sold. iPod's share of the U.S. market for MP3 players remains at over 70% based on the latest monthly data published by MPD, and iPod continued to be the top-selling MP3 player in most countries we track based on the latest data published by GFK.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We ended the quarter within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPod channel inventory.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">The iTunes Store generated all-time record results with revenue of almost $1.9 billion in the March quarter, an increase of 35% year-over-year, thanks to continued strong sales of music, video and apps. We now have a catalog of over 28 million songs and 45,000 movies.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">I'd now like to turn to iPhone. We were thrilled to sell 35.1 million iPhones compared to 18.6 million in the previous March quarter. That represents 88% year-over-year growth compared to 42% growth for the smartphone market overall in the March quarter based on the latest published estimate from IDC. We experienced very strong iPhone sales growth in all of our segments, led by our Asia Pacific and Japan segments where sales more than doubled year-over-year. We continue to see tremendous momentum in Greater China, where iPhone sales were 5x the level of the year ago quarter, aided by the launch of the iPhone 4S in China in January and the addition of China Telecom as an iPhone carrier in March. IPhone 4S is now available in over 100 countries and is sold through over 230 carriers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We ended the quarter with about 8.6 million iPhones in channel inventory, a sequential increase of about 2.6 million units, which placed us within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPhone channel inventory.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Recognized revenue from iPhone handset and accessory sales was $22.7 billion during the quarter compared to $12.3 billion in the year ago quarter, an increase of 85%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">iPhone momentum in the enterprise has evolved beyond email, calendar and contacts. IT and business line managers across industries see the opportunity to leverage both company and employee-owned devices to improve productivity and efficiencies through iOS in-house app development. In fact, the majority of the Fortune 500 companies who have approved iPhone on their networks are members of the iOS Developer Enterprise Program and are actively deploying in-house applications to their employee base.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Turning to iPad. We were very pleased with sales of 11.8 million iPads during the March quarter compared to 4.7 million in the year ago quarter, an increase of 151%. Customers are loving the new iPad with its stunning Retina display, A5X chip with Quad-core graphics and the 5-megapixel iSight camera. The new iPad is now available in over 40 countries, and we saw a very strong growth in iPad sales around the world with sales more than doubling in each of our segments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Recognized revenue from sales of iPad and iPad accessories during the quarter was $6.6 billion compared to $2.8 billion in the year ago quarter, an increase of 132%. We ended the quarter with about 2 million iPads in channel inventory, a sequential decrease of about 300,000 units, which placed us below our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPad channel inventory.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">The education market's interest in iPad continues to grow. In the March quarter, we sold more than 2 iPads for every Mac to our U.S. K-12 customers while also generating a record quarter for Mac sales. The San Diego School District purchased 10,000 iPads in the March quarter and plans to purchase over 15,000 more in the June quarter for middle school and high school programs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">iPad continues to open doors to new customers with whom Apple previously had no relationship. As we enter the K-12 institution buying season, we're hopeful that iPad will be a popular choice.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">iPad's momentum in business and government also continues to build. The United States Air Force Air Mobility Command is deploying thousands of iPads to serve as electronic flight bags, storing technical publications and operations information for flight crew members and trainers. Companies such as Bechtel and Balfour Beatty are using iPads in the field for project management and viewing blueprints. And thousands of iPads are being deployed as mobile sales tools by companies such as Roche, Amgen, Bayer and Daiichi Sankyo. Combining iPhone, iPad and iPod touch, we surpassed 365 cumulative iOS device sales, selling more than 50 million in the March quarter. The iOS ecosystem continues to expand and thrive with stores in more than 120 countries.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">The App Store now offers more than 600,000 apps, including over 200,000 apps specifically for iPad. We were very excited to announce the download of the 25th billionth app in March less than 4 years after the launch of the App Store.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">And iCloud is off to an incredible start, currently with more than 125 million customers signed up since its launch in October.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">I'd now like to turn to the Apple retail stores, which also generated record March quarter results. Revenue was $4.4 billion, an increase of 38% over the year ago quarter and was second only to the record quarterly revenue generated in the December quarter. The stores experienced very strong year-over-year growth in iPad and iPhone sales, and they sold 826,000 Macs compared to 797,000 in the year ago quarter. And about half the Macs sold in our stores during the March quarter were to customers who had never owned a Mac before.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We opened 2 new stores in the quarter, including our first Netherlands store in Amsterdam and a beautiful new store in Houston. We exited the quarter with 363 stores, nearly 1/3 of which are outside the United States. With an average of 361 stores open, average revenue per store was $12.2 million compared to $9.9 million in the year ago quarter, an increase of 23%. Segment margin reached a new March quarter record of over $1.1 billion, which was 26.1% of retail revenue. We welcomed 85 million visitors to our stores during the quarter compared to 71 million visitors in the year ago quarter, an increase of 19%. That translates to an average of 18,000 visitors per store per week.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Total company gross margin was 47.4%, which was 540 basis points higher than our guidance. About half this difference was driven by lower-than-expected commodity and other costs; about 1/4 was due to stronger-than-expected revenue and product mix, including 35 million iPhones; and the remainder was due to some onetime items that we don't expect to recur in the June quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Operating expenses were $3.2 billion and included $361 million in stock-based compensation expense. OI&amp;E was $148 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to cash. Our cash for short-term and long-term marketable securities totaled $110.2 billion at the end of the March quarter compared to $97.6 billion at the end of the December quarter, a sequential increase of $12.6 billion. And about $74 billion of the cash was offshore at the end of the March quarter. Cash flow from operations was $14 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">As we indicated last month, subject to board declaration, we expect to announce a dividend of $2.65 [ph] per share when we report our third quarter results in July. And we will provide information on the record and payment dates at that time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be about $34 billion compared to $28.6 billion in the June quarter last year. We expect gross margin to be about 41.5%, reflecting approximately $70 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be about $3.3 billion, including about $385 million related to stock-based compensation. We expect OI&amp;E to be about $175 million. And we expect the tax rate to be about 25.25%. We are targeting EPS of about $8.68.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In closing, we're extremely pleased with our record March quarter performance with earnings nearly doubling year-over-year. The new iPad is off to a tremendous start and is our fastest iPad rollout ever. We're thrilled with the global success of the iPhone 4S, which is now available in more than 100 countries, including China.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We remain very confident in our strategy, and we're very excited about the fabulous new products in our pipeline. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Thank you, Peter. [Operator Instructions] Operator, may we have the first question?</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p4\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">[Operator Instructions] And your first question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As it relates to the June quarter revenue guidance, it implies a sequential downtick that is worse than the guidance message you provided over the last 3 years. So can you just talk about some of the headwinds sequentially you see on the top line in the June quarter relative to March?</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Sure, Katy. It's Peter. The manufacturing ramps for the iPhone 4S and the new iPad were extremely successful for us. They yielded the highest launch supply and the fastest country rollouts for these product families that we've ever had. As a result, we were able to fulfill demand in the March quarter rather than the June quarter this year, and that generated revenue of over $39 billion. Therefore, unlike last year, we expect a sequential decline in revenue this year. I'd highlight 5 primary factors that have influenced our thinking:</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">The first, the iPhone channel inventory changes. As I discussed in my prepared remarks, we increased our iPhone channel inventory by about 2.6 million units in the March quarter this year, and we exited within our target inventory range of about 4 to 6 weeks. Last year, we continued to add new countries into the June quarter, and we built an additional 700,000 units of iPhone channel inventory last year in the June quarter. So the combination of these channel builds in the March quarter of this year and the June quarter of last year will impact the sequential comparisons from this year to last.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">The second factor: fabulous iPhone 4S execution. As we told you in January, we exited December with significant iPhone 4S backlog, which led to a huge January. We launched China and 20 other countries also in January, which completed the rollout of the iPhone 4S into all the countries where iPhone is currently shipping. And as I said before, we exited the quarter within a supply and demand balance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">The third factor: our new iPad execution was also fabulous. We had an incredible start with the new iPad. We launched with significant supply, leading to sales of 3 million units in the first couple of days, which was the -- and also the fastest country rollout ever. We therefore were able to satisfy much more of the demand for the new iPad in the March quarter this year compared to the iPad 2 in the March quarter of last year. This resulted in a shift of iPad volume into March this year versus last, and it will also affect the sequential compares this year to the last.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Fourth, we decreased the entry price of the entry iPad to $399.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">And finally, the last factor to point out, the U.S. dollar has strengthened recently, and we expect this to have an impact on the sequential compare, especially versus last year when the dollar weakened against most currencies over the comparable time periods.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We -- look, we've just reported the most amazing March quarter Apple has ever had. We feel very, very good about our business and our new product pipeline.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Just as a quick follow-up to number 4, the decrease in iPad price. You already saw a 7% sequential decline in March, which suggests that the uptake of the lower-priced iPad 2 was pretty phenomenal in March. Is that the right way to read it? And what does that demand tell you about the potential to move to lower price points on the iPad over time and see significant incremental demand?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Look, Katy, we're just learning about be the elasticity of demand and the $399 price point. It's doing well. But I have to tell you, the new iPad is on fire, and we're selling them as fast as we can make them. So we'll learn more over this quarter especially as we get through the education buying season, which looks terrific for us especially on the iPad.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">From Citigroup, we'll go to Richard Gardner.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Richard Gardner - Citigroup Inc, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">I recognize that you outgrew the market in Macs yet again. But I did want to get your views on the slowdown in year-over-year growth rate within the category and what factors you would attribute that to. Are we -- is it product transition related? Were the inventories down quarter-over-quarter? iPad cannibalization? Any other color that you can provide would be helpful.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Yes, Rich, it's Tim. As you said, we did outgrow the market. Macs grew at about 7% where the market grew about 2%. And so this is the 24th straight quarter that we've outgrown the market, and so we're extremely pleased with that. The compare to last year is largely affected by the fact that we changed the bulk of our portable line, or the MacBook Pros, in the February time frame of 2011. And so it's a very tough compare. Specifically, the portables last year were up 53% year-on-year. And obviously, that -- so that compare was very difficult. If you look at it sequentially, you also have to factor in that we had 14 weeks in the December quarter. And so the 26% year-over-year growth in December quarter is probably more like 17% when you factor out that 14th week. And so yes, I think there was some cannibalization from iPad and the market is slow. But the much, much larger factor and in fact, in -- it might be the vast majority of the difference is the compare to a year ago.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We'll go to -- [indiscernible] we'll go to Tony Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>A.M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">I was wondering if you could talk more broadly just about what you might be learning about lower priced -- price points on both the iPhone and iPad. I know it was asked earlier. But was the decrease in iPad price exclusively mix related? Or are there -- or is it a further broadening of your channel to indirect partners? But more broadly, Tim, maybe you could talk about elasticity, what you're learning about customer preferences for lower-priced offerings on both the iPhone and iPad. And I do have a follow-up, please.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Sure. Tony, on iPad 2, we're -- with the change in the entry price to $399, we're actually thrilled with the results that we've seen, although, as Peter said, it's only been a few weeks. And so it's too early to make a -- come to a clear conclusion. But from what we are seeing, this unlocks some education demand that is probably a more price-sensitive customer. Also, in several other countries, there was a marked change in demand at that price point. And so on the early going, we feel great about it. But I'd also point out that the new iPad is -- was current -- was supply constrained last quarter for the full 3 weeks or so it was shipping and is actually still constrained. And so the mix of the new iPad to the iPad 2, we're not certain of what that is yet. But we are certain, with what we've seen so far, that the absolute sales of iPad 2, at least in the early going, is very exciting. On the iPhone, we continue to be very happy with the moves that we made in pricing just a few months ago on the iPhone 3GS and the iPhone 4. And both of them contributed to our ability to achieve 35 million in sales, which is our second highest quarter of all time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>A.M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">The -- as a second question, I was wondering if you can talk about how you think about the markets for tablet and PC devices going forward. I think you've been fairly clear about saying that you believe that tablets will eclipse PCs in volume at some point. And I think you've also said they're somewhat discrete markets. There seems to be a lot of work, particularly on PC-based platforms, towards trying to combine the PC and tablet experience going forward in part because Windows 8 will be able to -- is a touch-based operating system as well. Can you comment about why you don't believe the PC or the Ultrabook and tablet markets or your MacBook Air and tablet markets won't converge? Isn't it realistic to think in a couple of years we're going to have a device that's under 2 pounds with great battery life that we can all carry around and open as a notebook or close up in a clever way and use as a tablet? Can you comment on why you don't think that product might not come or why you believe these markets are separate?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">I think, Tony, anything can be forced to converge. But the problem is that products are about trade-offs, and you begin to make trade-offs to the point where what you have left at the end of the day doesn't please anyone. You can converge a toaster and a refrigerator, but those things are probably not going to be pleasing to the user. And so our view is that the tablet market is huge. And we've said that since day one. We didn't wait until we had a lot of results. We were using them here, and it was already clear to us that there was so much you could do and that the reasons that people would use those would be so broad. And that's precisely what we've seen. We -- the iPad has taken off not only in consumer in a meaningful way but in education and in enterprise, and it's sort of everywhere you look now. And the applications are so easy to make very meaningful for someone, and there -- the -- there's such an abundance of those that -- and as the ecosystem gets better and better and as we continue to double down on making great products, I think that the limit here is nowhere in sight. We've now -- through the last quarter, I should say, which is just 2 years after we shipped the initial iPad, we\u2019ve sold 67 million. And to put that in some context, it took us 24 years to sell that many Macs and 5 years for that many iPods and over 3 years for that many iPhones. And we were extremely happy with the trajectory on all of those products. And so I think iPad, it's a profound product. It -- the breadth of it is incredible, and the appeal of it is universal. And so I am -- I could not be happier with being in the market, and the level at which we're innovating in both the product and the ecosystem here is incredible. Now in terms of the market itself, IDC and Gartner and Forrester had some numbers out there. I think Gartner is saying there's somewhere around 375 or so by 2015. Forrester is 375, somewhere around there. And so basically, the -- they're in the mid-300s, which is about where the PC market is today. And 2015 is only 3 years from now. And so I think even the more formal predictors outside of us are beginning to see these lines cross. And so I strongly believe that they will. Now having said that, I also believe that there is a very good market for the MacBook Air, and we continue to innovate in that product. And -- but I do think that it appeals to somewhat -- someone that has a little bit different requirements. And you wouldn't want to put these things together because you wind up compromising in both and not pleasing either user. Some people will prefer to own both, and that's great, too. But I think to make the compromises of convergence, so -- we're not going to that party. Others might. Others might from a defensive point of view, particularly. But we're going to play in both.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">We'll go to Bill Shope at Goldman Sachs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Tim, there's been quite a bit of concern both in the press and within the investment community around carrier subsidies. And I think the concerns are generally twofold: First, that carriers will attempt to stretch out the replacement cycle. And second, that over time, carriers across the globe will attempt to reduce subsidies significantly. I mean, how do you think about this risk? And do you think there are factors that could pressure subsidies going forward? And how would that impact Apple?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Well, Bill, our focus is on making the very best smartphone in the world. And a phone that delivers a -- just an off-the-charts user experience that customers want to use every day of their lives. And at the end of the day, I think that carriers, the vast majority of carriers, or maybe even all carriers, want to provide what their customers want to buy. And that's what they're motivated for. And so the most important thing by far is for Apple to continue making great products that customers want. And we are deeply committed to doing this and are innovating at a rate and pace that's unbelievable in this area. For -- from a carrier's perspective, I think it's important to remember that the subsidy is not large relative to the sum of the monthly payments across a 24-month contract period. And any delta between iPhone and maybe another phone is a -- an even smaller level of difference. And the iPhone has some distinct advantages for the carrier over competing smartphones. For example, many of the carrier executives have told me that churn from iPhone customers is the lowest of any phone they sell in their whole -- in all of the phones they carry. And that has a significant direct financial benefit to the carrier. Also, our engineering teams work extremely hard to be efficient with data and differently than some others. And we believe that as a result of this, that iPhone has far better data efficiency compared to other smartphones that are using sort of an app-rich ecosystem. Finally, we think that the -- and this is the most important, is that iPhone is the best smartphone on the planet to entice a customer who is currently using a traditional mobile phone to upgrade to a smartphone. This is by far the largest opportunity for Apple, for our carrier partners and is a great, fantastic experience to the customer. And so there's a win-win-win there. And so I think all of these factors are -- some of these factors are missed in this general discussion of subsidy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">That's helpful. I had one other follow-up question, if I could. I appreciate the user stats you gave us on iCloud. But can you give us any color, now it's been out for a few months, on how consumers are actually using iCloud? And in particular, are you seeing a big uptake in iTunes Match and paid storage additions? And how should we think about that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Bill, it's Peter. Customers are using all the features of iCloud. Response has been terrific. Feedback has been terrific. Pickup on storage is occurring, but it's growing because we've just launched iCloud in October. And we've now got over 125 million users that have come on to the service since then and they're building up documents in music and other things that they want to store. And so I think storage growth will come more over time. Our real desire here was not about selling more storage. We think Match is a great product, and we recommend that everybody use it. But it's a paid for service. We just really wanted to increase the customer delight from the entire ecosystem and platform of our iOS devices and the Mac, and that's why we've done iCloud. And we just -- we couldn't be happier that just a couple months into this, there's more than 125 million users around the world on iCloud.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">From Piper Jaffray, we'll hear from Gene Munster.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Charles Eugene Munster - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">If you could dig a little bit more into what's going on in China. I know you gave some high-level numbers. But is this increased distribution points, is it just price elasticity of lower-priced 3GS? Is it more people in China having money? All of the above? Anything that you can tell us to explain this vertical growth?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Gene, it was an incredible quarter in China. We -- the revenue was record -- was a record at $7.9 billion in Greater China, which is up over 3x year-over-year and brings the first half revenue for Greater China to $12.4 billion. That compares to a full year last year of $13.3 billion. So it is mind-boggling that we can do this well. A part of this was the pent-up demand for iPhone 4S. As you know, we launched mainland China in January of this year, and so China was not able to get into the Q1 period. So all of that is in Q2. We also have very strong demand for iPad 2. We have not shipped in mainland China yet the new iPad, although we are shipping in Hong Kong. And so it's a combination of these things. And the halo that both of these products have produced for the Mac is also incredible. Mac was up over 60% year-over-year. And that compares to a market rate of growth of about 6%. We have expanded point of sales. On a year-over-year basis, Mac is up 70% but still only 1,800 for all of Greater China. And so there's obviously a lot more opportunity there. iPhone, we're up over 11,000, which is 138%. But 11,000 is a much smaller number than we have in the U.S., and obviously, China will, in the next few years, be a bigger opportunity. iPad is only in 2,500 points of sale. And so yes, we've expanded. We've expanded a lot. However, there's a lot of headroom here in our view.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Charles Eugene Munster - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Was the iPhone mix in China different than the rest of the world? Or how was it different?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I don't have that in front of me, but my recollection is that it wasn\u2019t materially different. But keep in mind that iPhone 4S just launched in -- within the quarter. And so usually, when a new product launches within  the quarter, you would expect it to mix fairly much toward the new product.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Charles Eugene Munster - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And just one final quick question on iTunes content. It seems that there's kind of this logjam to getting more TV shows and movies and the rentals, and it's been a little bit of a slow pace of improvement. How important is getting better content on iTunes? And what's going to break that logjam?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Gene, it's Peter. We're actually thrilled with the rate that we're adding content into iTunes. This is something that we have to do country by country, so it takes a bit of time to put in place. We have the largest catalog of songs and movies available anywhere, over 28 million songs. And this led to almost $1.9 billion of revenue in the March quarter, which was up 35% year-over-year. So we're thrilled with the progress that we're making in iTunes and customers love it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And that will come from Ben Reitzes with Barclays.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Tim, the other big issue outside of the subsidy question that you just answered a couple of calls ago was regarding shortages. There's talk about potential Qualcomm shortages into the next couple of quarters and potential constraints even at year end for some pretty neat products that might be good for you to have in some products down the road. I know you don't comment on future products, but this is a big concern. And I guess can you just talk directionally about whether you expect long term to get your -- more than your fair share of product and what you need? And do you see any bottlenecks on the horizon that are major in that department or in any component down the line over the long term?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Tough question to answer, Ben. Obviously, we're aware of the lithography transition issue that you mentioned with 28 nanometer. We currently do not use 28-nanometer parts. But as you also know, we don't comment about future products, and so I can't talk about the future part. Generally, outside of this, we work very closely with our supplier partners and do everything that we can do to get supply. And sometimes, we're successful with that, and sometimes we're not. And so you can bet that we are focused on anything that we think may impact us and trying to push every button within our disposal to work on it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. Well, I appreciate that. And then my follow-up is regarding Walmart. They were actually just in our building in a conference here talking about how they're moving from one store in Arkansas now to 25 stores. And they seem really pleased with the \"store within a store\" concept. How is it going? And when can you be in all 10,000 stores?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">There's no plan to be in 10,000. And so we're trying some things. And as you know, that doesn't include the Mac. And so we're trying some things and seeing how it goes. And they've been a very good partner for us on iPod and have been selling iPods for a while and are an increasingly more substantial partner in the iPad space as well and an evolving partner on iPhone. And so we're working with them and enjoy working with them and hope to continue expanding.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">That will come from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montr\u00e9al.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Tim, for you, I think. Could you add some more specifics on iPhones in Asia Pacific, including China? Is supply-demand in balance there? Or that -- can that be a help? And then more broadly, with iPhones getting increased inventory of 2.6 million units, will that be a -- will that, in fact, go down in the June quarter? Is there any comments, you could provide there? And then I have a follow-up, please.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yes, let me start with the -- your last question. On the 2.6 million, our desire, just to be very clear on this, our desire was to increase inventory -- channel inventory across the quarter. As you might recall, we ended with only 6 million units in the channel coming out of December because we were extremely backlogged. And this is on particularly -- this is on 4S specifically. Our target is to be between 4 million and 6 million. The addition of the 2.6 million allowed us to get within that range by the end of the quarter. And so we feel that we exited the quarter as supply and demand balanced. Because our execution, the ops team was so good, the vast majority of the supply-demand in the different countries was reached by the end of January. And so we had the mother of all Januarys with the -- with really getting out of the vast majority of the iPhone 4S backlog and launching China as well. And so it was an incredible, incredible start of the quarter for us. Your other question was?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">On China specifically. It sounds like China can still be a help. Or it sounds like China is still supply-demand imbalanced. But I wanted to see if you could add some thoughts [ph] there in terms of iPhones.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">No. China is not supply-demand imbalanced on iPhone. On iPad, worldwide, we're supply constrained on the new iPad, both coming out of last quarter. And to give you a current view, we're still supply constrained on the new iPad. Demand has been incredibly robust, and we are selling them as fast as we can make them, as Peter mentioned earlier. In China, I believe on a macro basis, China has an enormous number of people moving into the higher income groups, middle class, if you will. And this is creating a demand for goods, not just Apple's but other companies' goods as well. And so I think there's a tremendous opportunity for companies that understand China, and we're doing everything we can to understand it and serve the market as good as we can.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">It certainly seems so. Tim, for my follow-up from Bill Shope's question, there have been some changes in Spain in particular on the behavior of their carriers and the economics. And Vodafone has actually changed some of their subsidy levels. It's only been about 30 days or 35 days, but have you seen any changes in demand levels in the Spanish market as a consequence of some of the activities of the carriers? And that's it for me.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes. Keith, Spain has been weak for us and probably more broadly for many companies. We -- our revenues grew in Spain last quarter but materially less than we grew in Europe or worldwide. However, that wasn't cause and effect related to the issue you're on, that Spain is just in a, I think, terrible economic situation. And so I sort of look at that as an unusual case. To be clear about what was done, is that -- I think there's also some noise in the pike on this one. What the carriers did was they still have subsidies for their existing customers. And I don't want to talk about what the -- their existing customer-to-new customer ratio is, but you can find out numbers from different parts of the world and model that. They pulled subsidies on new customers. And so it wasn't a pull of all subsidies, it was a pull of subsidies from new. And it -- all carriers in that market did not do that. A couple of the carriers did. So I wouldn't necessarily use that as a proxy for the world, I guess, is my point.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">From JPMorgan, we'll go to Mark Moskowitz.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">A question for Peter. Peter, can you provide a little more framework or context for us in terms of understanding how the segments dovetail with the 13% sequential revenue decline in the guidance? In terms of that bogey, what product segments could be higher in terms of decline or less than the decline?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Go ahead, Tim.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Oh, sorry. Go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Sure. iPhone, well, we would expect to have a year-over-year increase and a sequential decrease for the reasons that both Tim and I discussed. We built channel inventory in the March quarter, and we are exiting March in supply and demand balance. And we had a huge January. And for iPad, we would have a significant -- expect to have a significant year-over-year and sequential increase in sales. And I've got a -- I want to put something out just so it gets out on the call in case it's not asked and talk a little bit about the gross margin guidance that we provided for the June quarter. We're pleased to be providing a gross margin guidance of 41.5% for the quarter. We expect about 2/3 of the sequential decline to be primarily driven by a higher mix of iPads and Macs, a full quarter of selling the current iPad lineup and lots of leverage on the sequentially lower revenue. And we would expect the remainder of the difference to be primarily driven by the items benefiting the March quarter gross margin that we don't expect to recur in June.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And Mark, did you have a second question?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes. Tim, Tim, can you hear me?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes, I can now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay, great. Sorry about that. So just in terms of the -- your flexibility or versatility, you've been flexible here recently in terms of your cash usage as well as just providing more color or commentary during your earnings call. I was just wondering how we should think about opportunities for incremental flexibility as it relates to patent disputes. Is there a point where Apple maybe feels it reasonable to settle and just continue out-innovating and outgunning the competition rather than wage an ongoing litigation? Are there opportunities for that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I've always hated litigation, and I continue to hate it. We just want people to invent their own stuff. And so if we could get to some kind of arrangement where we could be assured that's the case and a fair settlement on the stuff that's occurred, I would highly prefer to settle versus battle. But it -- the key thing is that it's very important that Apple not become the developer for the world. We need people to invent their own stuff.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Next, we'll go to Shannon Cross with Cross Research Group.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">My first question is just going back to iCloud. Perhaps Tim, if you can talk a little bit more about feedback from customers? Curious sort of average number of devices of customers that customers are putting up or maybe percent of users attaching more than one device. Just sort of what's the initial feedback? And then I have a follow-up.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Shannon, it's Peter. I don't want to frustrate you, but, well, we have, of course, the data that you're asking for, but we don't want to help our competitors. And so it's not something that we're going to provide probably. The feedback that we're getting from customers on iCloud is just it's off the charts. They're loving it. And the fact that we could be here on the conference call with you in April just 5 or 6 months after introducing the service and have 125 million people around the world using it every day, I think, speaks for itself.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. And then my follow-up question is just on R&amp;D. I mean, it was up 45%. It's over $800 million now. I'm curious. So was a chunk of the growth from the acquisitions you've made? Or is there anything you can tell us in terms of your thoughts on R&amp;D and investment levels? Because it's definitely been ramping, which, I guess, bodes for good products coming for -- in the future.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Well, we view this as a good thing. We are investing in engineering to continue to bring out the most innovative products in the world to delight customers. We are making investments in our hardware and software engineering teams. We're shipping the best products that Apple has ever shipped today. And we've got some fabulous new products in the pipeline. So I'm very confident in the return that we're going to see on these investments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">You used to give sort of an idea of percentage to software, percentage of hardware. Is there anything you can give there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Shannon, I'm sorry. I don't have that in front of me.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">From Sterne Agee, we'll go to Shaw Wu.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Shaw Wu - Sterne Agee &amp; Leach Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Just a quick clarification. I understand you disclosed China in terms of the 4S shipping along with 21 countries early in January. What about China Telecom specifically? When did that launch?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Shaw, it's Tim. We launched with China Telecom in March. And in early part of March, we were at a supply-demand balance with them prior to the end of the quarter. We're very happy to be working with them.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">From Bank of America Merrill Lynch, we'll go to Scott Craig.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Scott D. Craig - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Peter, on the OpEx side, that's an area where you guys have been getting a fair amount of leverage. If you look year-over-year, it's down pretty significantly as a percentage of sales. So I'm just curious on your thoughts going forward, maybe not just next quarter but sort of how do you think about the OpEx leverage longer term? And then, Tim, can you just kind of take us through the components like you do on most quarter calls and where you're seeing some pricing better than expected and maybe worse than expected and put that in the context of going forward as well?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes, Scott, it's Peter. We are, as I discussed in Shannon's question, investing in R&amp;D to introduce the most innovative products in the market. We are also spending on marketing, advertising, opening more of our own retail stores and expanding our indirect channels around the world to increase sales. And we're investing in infrastructure to support our growth and also stock-based comp for our employees. We are very confident in the investments that we're making. We're thinking about the long term, and we're confident in the returns that we're going to get in -- on these investments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Scott, in terms of component costs for the quarter we just finished, Q2 component costs were better than we had planned, and this assisted us in exceeding our gross margin guidance, as Peter talked about earlier. Displays and NAND flash drove the majority of the favorable commodity cost benefit. In terms of the June quarter and the -- what we factored into our guidance, NAND and mobile DRAM supply continued to exceed demand. And because of that, we expect pricing will continue to be favorable. For most LCDs, we expect pricing to stabilize as the market moves to a supply-demand balance. The hard drive market has moved to a supply-demand balance, and we expect marketing -- market pricing to decline but will still be higher than the pre-flood level from the tragedy in Thailand. Most other components are expected to fall in line with or somewhat faster than historical trends.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And we'll go to Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Kulbinder Garcha - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Just a clarification, Pete. Did you say that 2/3 of the sequential gross margin decline was basically due to products? And did I hear that right? Can you clarify that? Because it seems like quite a rapid drop, and I'm just wondering how much conservatism is in your gross margin guidance. And then I have a follow-up for Tim afterwards.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Sure, Kulbinder, the 2/3 that I talked about, the sequential decline, we see as being driven by a higher mix of iPads and Macs, a full quarter of selling the current lineup of the iPad or the current iPad lineup, and then a loss of leverage on the sequentially lower revenue. So those 3 factors we see driving 2/3 of the sequential decline.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Kulbinder Garcha - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay, great. And then, Tim, just a question on the enterprise side. You mentioned a couple of times how the iPad is being taken into new markets, new verticals, whether it's because of the price point of the innovation. I'm just wondering specifically what resources is Apple dedicating to have a much more direct relationship with the enterprise? Can you speak on what's changed in the last 6 or 12 months and what you think you need to do to become a more credible or significant enterprise player?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Initially, our focus was on working with the Fortune 500 and the Global 500 to get the iPad certified for their particular enterprise. And I'm pleased to report that 94% of the Fortune 500 are testing or deploying iPads and 75% of the Global 500 are testing or deploying the iPad. So these numbers are just off the charts for a product that's only 24 months old. And so we are moving our focus away from this and focusing on penetration within these accounts. Peter alluded to some of the wins that we have had in the -- his opening comments. The incredible things about these are that they span across many verticals, through government, through education, and many different functions within the enterprise. It's absolutely the most broad-based product I have ever seen in my whole career in terms of adoption rate into the enterprise. And so yes, this means that we're applying more resources in Fes [ph] and salespeople to interact directly with these customers. We also work with our carrier partners and our reseller partners in delivering both the products and services that are wrapped around that to these customers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">We'll go to Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Chris, are you there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Hello? Can you hear me?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yes, we can.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay, sorry about that. If I take your revenue guidance and the comments you made around gross margin at face value, it seems to imply that you expect iPhone unit sales to be down about 10 million units quarter-on-quarter. First, is that in the right ballpark? And secondly, are you just being conservative with respect to the outlook? Or have you seen a change in the end demand environment for the phone?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Chris, let me sort of go in reverse order. We are incredibly confident in our business, our strategy and what we're doing. When we give you guidance, we give you guidance that we have reasonable confidence in achieving. And finally, we do expect a sequential decline in iPhone sales driven by the fact that we built 2.6 million units of channel inventory in the March quarter, which we needed to do. We're now within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks, and we entered the March quarter with significant backlog, as we talked about, in January. And we're able to fulfill that and launch 20 countries in the month of January. So \u2013- we have immense confidence in what we're doing and are very pleased with the way our business is performing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">A follow-up, if I could, on iPad. It is supply constrained across many geos, as you talked about. Is there a specific component issue? Do you have visibility on resolution? When do you expect to be able to meet demand in the iPad?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">It's hard to answer meet the demand. What I'm confident about, however, is that we will be able to supply a significant number of iPads during the quarter, and I feel very, very confident about that. It's tough to know precisely that it will balance until you get there, but I'm very confident with the improving supply and that the total number will be very significant.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Thank you, Chris.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking today is Apple\u2019s CFO, Peter Oppenheimer; and he\u2019ll be joined by Apple\u2019s CEO, Tim Cook; and Treasurer, Gary Wipfler for the Q&amp;A session with analysts.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Please note that some of the information you\u2019ll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, stock-based compensation expense, taxes, earnings per share and future products. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple\u2019s Form 10-K for 2011, the Form 10-Q for the first and second quarters of fiscal 2012 and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today along with the attached press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Peter Oppenheimer for introductory remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you, Nancy. We\u2019re pleased to report the results of our third fiscal quarter. We established new all-time quarterly record for iPad unit sales and new June quarter records for iPhone and Mac unit sales, leading to our highest June quarter revenue and earnings ever.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Revenue for the quarter was $35 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 23%. The $6.5 billion increase over the prior June quarter\u2019s result was driven primarily by strong growth in iPad and iPhone sales.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Operating margin was $11.6 billion, representing 33% of revenue. Net income was $8.8 billion, increasing 21% over the prior June quarter\u2019s results. The quarter\u2019s net income translated to diluted earnings per share of $9.32.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Turning to the details of the quarter, I\u2019d like to begin with our Mac products and services. We sold 4 million Macs establishing a new June quarter record. This represents 2% growth year-over-year, compared to IDCs latest published estimate of 1% contraction of the global personal computer market in the June quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Last month, we updated the entire MacBook lines with faster processors, graphics, memory, flash storage and USB 3.0 connectivity. We also introduced the all-new 15 inch MacBook Pro with Retina Display, all flash architecture and quad core processors and customer response has been excellent.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">While receiving tremendous momentum for the iPad in education, which I\u2019ll discuss later, we also experienced our best quarter ever for U.S. education institution Mac sales with Portables representing nearly three quarters of total Mac sales.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Notable large education transaction closed during the June quarter, include Rutherford County, North Carolina, which has purchased 6,000 MacBook Airs to support its 21<sup>st</sup> Century Digital Learning Environment, and Pueblo Colorado School District 70 were all high school students and K-12 staff in the 22 School District will convert to MacBook Air. We began and ended the quarter with between three and four weeks of Mac channel inventory, which is below our target range of four to five weeks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Tomorrow, we will release Mountain Lion, the ninth major release of OS X. Mountain Lion introduces more than 200 features including all-new messages app, notification center, system wide sharing, and Facebook integration. We built iCloud into the foundation of Mountain Lion, making it easier than ever for customers to keep content up-to-date across all their devices.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Moving to our music products, we sold 6.8 million iPods compared to 7.5 million in the year ago quarter. Total iPod sales were ahead of our expectation and iPod Touch continue to account for over half of all iPod sold. iPod share of the U.S. market for MP3 players remained at over 70% based on the latest monthly data published by NPD and iPod continue to be the top selling MP3 player in most countries we track based on the latest data published by GfK.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We ended the quarter within our target range of four to six weeks of iPod channel inventory. The iTunes Store generated very strong results in the quarter with revenue of over 1.8 billion, thanks to continued strong sales of music, apps and other content. We are pleased to launch the iTunes Store in 12 countries including Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan last month. Customers can choose from over 20 million songs to purchase and download from iTunes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We\u2019re continuing to see great interest in iTunes U. Since rolling it out in January, there have been over 40 million downloads of the iTunes U app. Over 700 new K-12 schools and districts and over 125 colleges and universities have enrolled in the iTunes U program, while over 750 new courses have been published.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">I\u2019d now like to turn to iPhone. We sold 26 million iPhones compared to 20.3 million in the previous June quarter; that represents 28% year-over-year growth and was ahead of the amount we factored into our guidance following very strong sales in channel inventory build we achieved in the March quarter. We added several small regional carriers during the quarter and now have iPhone distribution through over 250 carriers in over 100 countries.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We ended the quarter with about 8.3 million iPhones in channel inventory, a sequential decline of about 300,000 iPhones, and we remained within our target range of four to six weeks of iPhone channel inventory. Recognized revenue from iPhone handset and accessory sales was $16.2 billion during the quarter compared to $13.3 billion in the year ago quarter, an increase of 22%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Enterprises across the globe continue to choose iPhone as the standard device for their employees. We estimate that the number of iPhones in the Fortune 500 has more than doubled in the past year. iPhone is helping businesses and employees to be more productive wherever they are.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">PepsiCo has deployed thousands of iPhones with an in-house app build specifically for their field merchandisers. This app has eliminated paper reports and provides real-time information to managers, sales teams and delivery drivers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">German insurance provider ERGO has built an in-house app for iPhone that thousands of agents use to process insurance claims, which has significantly reduced paper work and improved processing time and customer satisfaction.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Turning to iPad, we were thrilled with sales of over 17 million iPads during the June quarter compared to 9.2 million in the year ago quarter, an increase of 84%. We saw very strong year-over-year growth in iPad sales around the world and are pleased to be selling iPad in 97 countries.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Recognized revenue from sales of iPad and iPad accessories during the quarter was $9.2 billion compared to $6.0 billion in the year ago quarter, an increase of 52%. We ended the quarter with about 3.2 million iPads in channel inventory, a sequential increase of about 1.2 million units, which left us just within our target range of four to six weeks of iPad channel inventory.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">\t</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">The iPad continues to be a great success in the U.S. education market, with sales setting a new quarterly record and nearly doubling year-over-year to just under 1 million iPads. While interest in the new iPad was high, sales of the reduced price iPad 2 in the K-12 market were particularly strong. And even though, as I mentioned earlier, we achieved all time record Mac sales to U.S. education institutions during the quarter. We sold more than twice as many iPads as Macs to U.S. education institutions. We are extremely pleased with these results.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">One great example of iPad adoption in education is the Mansfield Texas Independent School District, which has purchased 11,000 iPads. This fall, every Mansfield High School student and teacher will receive an iPad under the district\u2019s Power Up initiative. Some teachers will use a flipped classroom concept, putting their lessons and resources online where students can access them anytime with their iPads. As a result, students take responsibility for their own learning and teachers are able to increase their interactions and personalize content time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">iPad continues its rapid adoption within the enterprise. We estimate that the number of iPads in the Fortune 500 has more than tripled in the past year. iPad has become an indispensable tool worldwide to help employees across industries do their jobs more effectively. British Airways has incorporated thousands of iPads across their business from customer support at check-in to cabin service directors replacing paper printout to details customer preferences and provide real-time updates. And homebuilder Dialogue House in Japan is actively building smart homes that will be controlled by iPads, and their sales reps are using iPads to show floor plans and upgrade options.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Combining iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch, we surpassed 410 million cumulative iOS device sales, selling more than 45 million in the June quarter. With App Stores in 155 countries, the iOS ecosystem continues to grow. The App Store now offers more than 650,000 apps, including over 225,000 apps specifically for iPad. We\u2019re extremely pleased to report that we have surpassed $5.5 billion in payment to developers, and customers are loving iCloud. Since its launch in October, more than 150 million people are using iCloud services.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In June, we previewed many of the exciting new features of iOS 6 at our Developers Conference, including our fabulous new maps app, new functionality and broader language support for Siri, direct Facebook integration, shared photo streams via iCloud and Passbook, the simplest way to get all your passes in one place. We believe iOS 6 will significantly enhance the experience of one in an iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch, and we can\u2019t wait to get it into the hands of customers this fall.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">I\u2019d now like to turn to the Apple retail stores. Revenue was $4.1 billion, an increase of 17% over the year-ago quarter, with growth yield primarily by all-time record iPad sales and strong growth in iPhone sales. The store sold 791,000 Macs compared to 768,000 in the year-ago quarter. And almost half the Macs sold in our stores during the quarter were the customers who had never owned a Mac before.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We opened a total of nine new stores in the quarter and exited the quarter with 372 stores, including 123 stores outside the United States. With an average of 367 stores opened, average revenue per store was $11.1 million compared to $10.8 million in the year-ago quarter. Segment margin was $868 million compared to $802 million in the year-ago quarter. We welcomed 83 million visitors to our stores during the quarter, compared to 74 million visitors in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 12%. That translates to an average of 17,000 visitors per store per week.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Total company gross margin was 42.8%, which was 130 basis points higher than our guidance. We experienced upside from better than expected commodity, warranty and other costs. These factors were partially offset by a stronger mix of iPad sales, a higher mix of lower priced iPhones, and a stronger U.S. dollar relative to our expectations. Operating expenses were $3.4 billion and included $378 million in stock-based compensation expense. OI&amp;E was $288 million and the tax rate was 25.6%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to cash, our cash for short-term and long-term marketable securities totaled $117.2 billion at the end of the June quarter compared to $110 billion at the end of the March quarter, a sequential increase of $7 billion, and about $81 billion of the cash was offshore at the end of the June quarter. Cash flow from operations was $10.2 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Today, we\u2019re announcing that our Board of Directors has declared a dividend of $2.55 per common share payable on August 16, 2012 to stockholders of record after the close of business on August 13, 2012. Going forward, subject to declaration by our Board, we expect to announce record and payment dates for future dividends concurrently with our quarterly earnings announcements. Also, as we previously announced, our Board has authorized a three-year $10 billion share repurchase program starting in our fiscal 2013, which begins on September 30, 2012.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As we move ahead into the September quarter, I\u2019d like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be about $34 billion compared to $28.3 billion in the September quarter last year. We expect gross margin to be about 38.5%, reflecting approximately $70 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be about $3.5 billion, including about $390 million related to stock-based compensation. We expect OI&amp;E to be about $175 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 25.50%. We are targeting EPS of about $7.65.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In closing, we\u2019re pleased with our record June quarter results, including sales of over 17 million iPads. We established new June quarter records for unit sales of iPhone and Macs and posted our best quarter ever for U.S. education. We remain extremely confident in our strategy and the investments we are making in our business. We\u2019re very excited to be launching Mountain Lion tomorrow and iOS 6 in the fall and we have some more amazing new products in our pipeline that we look forward to discussing with you later.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">With that I\u2019d like to open the call to questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p4\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We\u2019d like to ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. May we have the first question, please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">(Operator Instructions) Your first question will come from Kathy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Kathryn Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Yes, thank you. Peter, I want to better understand the gross margin guidance for September, given that it\u2019s been nearly two years since you\u2019ve operated at a sub-40% gross margin. I understand mix may go against you a little bit in the near-term, but it should be structurally higher than two years ago, you have NAND pricing moving in your favor, and the products that you\u2019re selling in the market are relatively mature, so manufacturing cost should be favorable. Can you just talk about the dynamics that are pushing gross margins down again in September? Then I\u2019ve a follow-up.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We expect the gross margin as I said to be about 38.5%, which is down about 430 basis points sequentially. We expect most of this decline to be primarily driven by a fall transition and to a much lesser extent, the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. The warranty benefit that we saw in the June quarter is not repeating and a full quarter of the Back to School promotion. So that\u2019s what we see doing it, Katy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Kathryn Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Okay. And then as a follow-up Tim, you\u2019ve obviously seen spectacular growth in China over the last several years, but there are some macro concerns in the market and your Asia-Pacific growth rate did decelerate from over 100% to I think 25% this quarter. So, can you talk about what you\u2019re seeing in China as it relates to overall demand? Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Yes, Katy. Hi, it\u2019s Tim. The growth in Asia-Pacific was 25% as you indicated, and the vast majority of the difference in our sequential growth rate was a result of Greater China, which represents about two-thirds of our revenue of that region. As we reported for Q2, our Greater China revenue was $7.9 billion; and in Q3, our revenue was $5.7 billion. Now the $5.7 billion is a 48% year-over-year increase and so, it still is growing at incredible rates. Virtually, all of the $2.2 billion sequential revenue decline, was due to iPhone sales in Greater China and about half of that $2.2 billion is attributable to changes in the channel inventory not the underlying sell through of the iPhone.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">As a reminder, in the previous quarter, in our fiscal Q2, we launched the iPhone 4S in China in January. We added China Telecom as the second carrier in March, and as we proceeded across the quarter, we increased the channel inventory to accommodate the sales and to reach our target inventory of four to six weeks. The remainder of the sequential revenue decline is mainly attributable to normal seasonality after the very successful iPhone 4S launch. We did not see an obvious impact in Q3 that we would associate with the economy in Mainland China. We look at the economic report as all of you do and see the press. But again, we did not see something that we would attribute to the economy in China.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">In terms of iPhones in general in Mainland China, we were incredibly pleased with our results. We were up over 100% year-over-year, and as you probably know, just last Friday, so in Q4, we launched our new iPad in China after we resolved the iPad trademark issue. And so our sales did not benefit from the new iPad in the June quarter in Mainland China. Also, our new portables that we announced at the Worldwide Developers Conference began to ship in Mainland China last week after we received routine regulatory approval, and once again, the June quarter sales did not benefit from these products.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So, net, we remain really confident about our plans and are very excited about our opportunity in China, and are very much looking forward to incorporating more local services as you probably saw in the Worldwide Developers Conference announcement of iOS 6, which will be coming in the fall.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Thank you, Kathy. Could we have the next question please.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">From Goldman Sachs, we will hear from Bill Shope.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Bill C. Shope \u2013 Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Okay. Great, thanks. Can you talk about your thoughts on the individual segment trends when looking at your guidance. I know last quarter you\u2019ve given us some thoughts on that. Could you walk through how we\u2019re thinking about it now coming off of the sequential declines this quarter particularly on the iPhone segment?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Sure, Bill, it\u2019s Peter. Let me start off and if Tim wants to add something, he can. I will first talk about the products and then a little bit about how we are thinking of revenue. For iPhone, we would expect to have a year-over-year increase in sales in the September quarter. For iPad, we would also expect to have a year-over-year increase, but we would point out that we increased channel inventory in the June quarter by 1.2 million units. And in the year ago quarter, we also increased the iPad inventory at that time by 1.5 million units. And for Mac, we would expect a sequential increase.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">As we think about revenue, we\u2019re providing revenue guidance that is up by 20% year-over-year. We\u2019ve included several things on our \u2013 thinking. The first, we are not expecting the economies in Europe or the natural resource based countries including Australia, Brazil and Canada to improve from what we saw in the June quarter. As Tim said, we saw no obvious evidence of the economy impacting our sales in China in the June quarter or in the U.S., but we are reading the same things that you all are about these economies. So we will have to see.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Our weekly iPhone sales continue to be impacted by rumors and speculation regarding new products. We exited the June quarter in supply and demand balance and we were within our four to six week inventory target. We also don\u2019t expect to add any significant new country or carrier additions in the September quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Regarding iPad, as I said, we\u2019re able to increase our iPad channel inventory in the June quarter by 1.2 million units and we ended the June quarter just within our four to six week channel inventory target and we increased last year by 1.5 million units in the September quarter, which also put us in our four to six week inventory target. These increases in channel inventory will impact both the year-over-year and sequential compares for iPad. The current iPad lineup that we're selling includes the very successful $399 price point, which we did not have in the year-ago quarter. So this, along with mix in the line will impact the ASPs in the September quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">And finally, the U.S. dollar has strengthened against most currencies around the world including the euro, Brazilian Real, the Chinese RMB, British Pound, Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar, Mexican Peso and Swiss Franc. We expect this to have an adverse impact to revenue in these countries in excess of $400 million sequentially net of our hedges. All that being said, we very much look forward to introducing iOS 6 in the fall and we remain very confident in our business and our new product pipeline.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Bill C. Shope \u2013 Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay. And just to follow-up if I could on the sequential iPhone decline. you gave us a pretty good outline of what was going on in China, but can you walk us through some of the trends you saw for iPhone demand sequentially in the other international region?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Yeah, Bill, it\u2019s Tim. First of all, at a global level, I think it\u2019s important to understand as you compare our Q2 iPhone sales to Q3, there is a fairly large channel inventory difference that is embedded in that. As you recall, in January, we completed the iPhone 4S rollout in all the major countries, including China. It was our fastest iPhone rollout ever. We were also able to get the channel at a \u2013 within our target inventory range of four to six weeks by the end of March. And so what that did was, it increased sell in over sell through by 2.6 million units. In the quarter that we just finished, our sell in was less than sell through by 300,000 units. And so the net change in channel inventory across the quarter is about 3 million units. And so, I think it\u2019s important to understand that to look at the underlying sell through trends.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">In terms of what we see happening in the different geographies, the U.S. was very strong, running at 47%, Japan was strong at 45%. I\u2019ve already mentioned Greater China was up 66%, but Mainland China was over doubled as I said before, it\u2019s over 100% up. The geography that did not perform well was Europe. Europe was essentially flat, slightly positive year-on-year and that really hampered our total results.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Within Europe, now I\u2019ll switch from iPhone to talking about more of the gross revenue level. We see a margin difference between the countries. The U.K. was relatively solid at 30% growth, but France and Greece and Italy were particularly poor, and Germany was also similarly a single-digit positive growth for the quarter. Eastern Europe was strong, materially stronger than Western Europe, but obviously the Western European countries drive the preponderance of the revenue in that segment. And so, we\u2019re certainly seeing a slow down in business in that area. Fortunately, the U.S. and China, although I realize it\u2019s getting a lot of crest, we\u2019re not seeing anything that we would classify as an obvious economic issue.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Bill Shope \u2013 Goldman Sachs</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay, very helpful. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Thanks, Bill. Could we have the next question please.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Next we\u2019ll go to Ben Reitzes with Barclays.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Ben Alexander Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Yeah, thanks a lot. My first question, I wanted to ask about the fall transition you mentioned, Peter, when you are talking about gross margin. Can you talk a little bit about that, what is the sequential impact on margins and revenue that you\u2019re baking in and then qualitatively how much would you get back in the December quarter or how much of it\u2019s short-term?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. Ben, I don\u2019t want to frustrate you or others, but the fall transition that I spoke about is driving most of the decline that we see sequentially in gross margin. It\u2019s not something that we\u2019re going to talk about in any level of detail today and we could not be more confident in our new product pipeline.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Ben Alexander Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. Just with regard to the iPhone in general, you mentioned there were speculation about new products and rumors, but do you have any quantification of how much that hurt sales in the quarter either from you or Tim, and how much that maybe channel inventory reduction you\u2019ll need to do in the next quarter maybe resulting from that type of speculation?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Ben, I think there is a lot of speculation out there. It\u2019s difficult to sort out, but I\u2019m fairly convinced based on what I\u2019ve seen that there is an incredible anticipation out there for future products and as you would expect given what we\u2019ve been able to deliver in the past. And so I think it\u2019s a reasonable amount. In terms of channel inventory in the current quarter, we put our current thinking in the guidance that Peter provided to you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Ben Alexander Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay, thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Yeah.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Thanks, Ben. Could we have next question please.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Next we\u2019ll hear from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Shannon Cross \u2013 Cross Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Thank you very much. Can you talk a bit about the Mac business, I mean it was up 2% year-over-year, clearly still outperforming the market, but can you talk about what you\u2019re seeing how much of the slower growth was from say the product transition versus weak economy and then any thoughts on cannibalization of Mac by the iPad?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Shannon, it\u2019s Tim. It\u2019s clear the PC market is weak based on the latest IDC data, but frankly we believe the primary factor for our lower growth rate in the Mac area is the timing of our portable announcement within last quarter. As you know, we announced an entirely new portable line up that\u2019s been incredibly well received. That was done with three weeks or less than three weeks remaining in the quarter. The year ago compare we made the transition in the portable area in February and so we were selling our new line up for the entire Q3 period.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And so, if you look at the data underneath that to further illustrate this, prior to the Developers Conference, our weekly Mac sales were running below the prior year. After the Developers Conference, the MacBook Pros and the MacBook Airs drove year-over-year increases in weekly sell through. And they were to the level that got us back to an overall positive territory for the quarter and our 25 consecutive quarter of growing faster than the market. The MacBook Pro with the Retina display was incredibly well received, we ended the quarter in backlog, and we still have not caught up with demand yet, but anticipate doing so next month.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Also to further illustrate the portable point, for the month of June, the NPD data that just came out for the United States showed our portable share at 25.5% and a record 47% of revenue share in the month of June. And so, I would attribute a large amount to what has happened in terms of the timing of our portable announcement.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Shannon Cross \u2013 Cross Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay, great. And then could you talk a little bit, Tim, about what your conversations are like with the carriers in terms of pricing, subsidies, there's been a lot of talk about that over the last few months. So just how are your discussions with the carriers going clearly into the product transition that\u2019s coming?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Let me avoid talking about the product transition, but you\u2019re very smart to ask that. I don't want to get into specific topics about with different carriers, but generally I would just say that our role is to make the very best smartphone in the world and that has an incredible user experience far superior than anything else that customers want to use everyday. And I think at the end of the day, the carriers want to buy or want to provide their customers with \u2013 what their customers want to buy. And so the most important thing for Apple by far is to continue making the best products in the world and we are very deeply committed to doing this and we\u2019re maniacally focused on it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">From the carrier\u2019s perspective, I think it\u2019s also important to remember that the total subsidy that they pay is fairly small relative to the monthly payments they collect over a 24-month contract period. And I think many would tell you, they certainly told to me, that iPhone has several advantages for them over other smartphones, the churn rates are much less, you see carriers now focusing on shared data plans and I think an iPhone customer is likely more \u2013 is more likely to have a Tablet or an iPad. And so I think they really value these customers quite a bit.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Also, our engineering teams are very sensitive to working with carriers to find the most efficient way to deal with data. And we think that we are the most efficient smartphone on the market for smartphones that are in an app rich ecosystem. And so we are going to continue to focus \u2013 focusing on making the best product and I think that the carriers will be very motivated to make sure that they provide that to the customers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Shannon Cross \u2013 Cross Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yeah.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thank you, Shannon. Could we have our next question, please<strong>?</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Next, we\u2019ll hear from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Toni M. Sacconaghi \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yes, thank you. I have one for Peter and one for Tim, please. Peter, you talked about how you were above expectations relative to your guidance on iPhone, and you also mention you were above expectations on iPod, and you said you were thrilled iPad, yet your EPS I think came in 5% or 6% above your guidance. So perhaps you can help us illustrate where you were disappointed to relative to your original guidance, because I think the commentary would certainly point to a much larger beat?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Toni, look, given what\u2019s going on around us, we are happy with our quarter. Sales of each of our products did exceed what we had factored into the guidance. That was especially true of the iPad, which set a new record at 17 million units, and the $35 billion of revenue that we reported grew by $6.5 billion year-over-year. We do think some things did this in the quarter, so let me comment on that. The economy in Europe is not doing well. We think this impacted our results. We also saw some economic impact in the natural resource space economies, including Australia, Brazil and Canada.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">As Tim discussed regarding iPhone, we\u2019re reading the same rumors and speculation that you are about a new iPhone, and we think this has caused some pause in customers purchasing. The timing of availability of Intel\u2019s Ivy Bridge and resulting rumors about the new portables impacted our sales in April and May. Tim talked about how after WDC we saw a large increase in sales both in terms of weekly sales before WDC and on a year-over-year basis, and customers are loving the new MacBook Pro. and we did not get the benefit of launching the new iPad in China or the new portables as we are pursuing routine regulatory approval.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">and finally, the dollar strengthened against most currencies around the world, which reduced our revenue growth sequentially by over $200 million net of our hedges. So, we think these things impacted the quarter. We\u2019re happy very with how the business is performing and are excited about our new product pipeline.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Toni M. Sacconaghi \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thank you for that. Tim, the question that I had for you is, whether you could talk a little bit about smartphone growth in emerging markets. China is obviously the biggest one. Some of the data that I\u2019ve seen suggest that about 70% of the smartphones that are being purchased in places like China and other emerging countries are under $300, and in many cases under $200. Do you agree with that market characterization, and at some point does that become a limit \u2013 does that limit your ability to gain share in a marketplace where its 70% of the units are at a price point that you currently don\u2019t play in? At what point does that math prevent you from gaming share, and what are your strategies for ensuring continued share going forward, if indeed that\u2019s an objective?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Toni, the specific data that you\u2019ve quoted, the 70% doesn\u2019t match to what I\u2019ve seen, but let me try to answer your general question without that specific. We\u2019ve been very focused, as you know on China, because we see it as an enormous opportunity for us. And I\u2019m very pleased that we were able to grow our iPhone sales over a 100% last quarter. And so, yes, I feel very, very good about that, and I firmly believe that people in the emerging markets won\u2019t great products like they do in developed markets and so forth. And so we\u2019re going to stick to our knitting and make the best products. And we think that if we do that, we\u2019ve got a very, very good business ahead of us. So, that\u2019s what we are doing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Toni M. Sacconaghi \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And the share objected in and of itself is not an explicit one Tim, that\u2019s a consequence of making good products that either happens or it doesn\u2019t or is that an explicit objective for the iPhone business on a global basis and on an emerging markets basis?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I wouldn\u2019t go historic for the company in total, so it\u2019s not just iPhone, but across everything that we make is to make the very best product, and that\u2019s more important, and overshadows all other things. But we do believe by doing that, that we will have a great business, and I think that our results today really show that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Toni M. Sacconaghi \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yeah.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thanks, Toni. Could we have our next question, please<strong>?</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">From Pacific Crest, we\u2019ll go to Andy Hargreaves.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Andy Hargreaves \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Hi. Just first clarification, is the channel inventory commentary on a look forward basis?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">You are talking about the week Andy?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Andy Hargreaves \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yeah, correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">The week that we quote are forward-looking looking, because inventory is in the channel for forward sales.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Andy Hargreaves \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yeah, okay. So then the comments on iPad being just slightly within the range of four to six weeks, which seem to imply a fairly significant slowdown sequentially in sell through, can you comment on what\u2019s driving that expectation?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Keep in mind that the channel inventory is only for the indirect channel. But, it\u2019s not used for to support any direct sales, and direct sales are Apple retail sales, Apple online sales, Apple education sales. And so, I don\u2019t want to give you a specific guidance on iPad sales. It\u2019s important to keep that in mind, and that\u2019s just not the case with iPad, but it\u2019s the case with all products. I know that there are some companies out there they refer to their channel inventory in terms of their gross sales, but we don\u2019t do that, because we feel very strongly that it only supports the channel sales, so that\u2019s how we calculate it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Andy Hargreaves \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay, thanks. And then just you\u2019ve obviously talked a fair amount of pricing umbrellas in the past, and on the iPhone side, if you don\u2019t think to address that. How are you thinking about that now on the iPad side? Now that there is some slightly higher quality competition like the Nexus 7 at lower price points?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We re-priced the iPad 2 to $399, and it did very well in the quarter. The most popular iPad is the new iPad, but iPad 2 did very well. It was particularly a key in the K-12 area that Peter spoke about earlier where we sold about 1 million units for the quarter. And so, we have been very aggressive in the space, and I don\u2019t see changing that in terms of competition, we\u2019ve all seen, I think many different tablets, hundreds of them come to market over the last few year. And I have yet to see any of them really gain what I would call any level of traction at all.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We have over 225,000 apps that have been optimized for iPad. There is a incredible experience on iPad, and I still think the market very much where most customers feel they\u2019re not really looking for tablet, they\u2019re just looking for an iPad. And we\u2019re going to keep innovating in the space and keep making great products, and I think we\u2019ll keep a very strong business going forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">The 17 million iPads was up 84% year-over-year, and we\u2019ve now shipped over 84 million, this is as of the end of last quarter. iPads, which if you look at that on a trajectory rate, it took us more than twice as long to achieve that on iPod and a third longer on \u2013 we achieved it in the third less time on the iPad than iPhone, so we feel really, really good about our momentum in this space.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Andy Hargreaves \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yeah.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Thanks Andy. Could we have the next question, please<strong>?</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Next, we\u2019ll hear from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Gene A. Munster \u2013 Piper Jaffray, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Hey, good afternoon. Tim, I know you just talked a little bit about the iPad that is there. You gave a little bit more information on the iPhone. Could you talk a little bit more about just what segments have been driving, you mentioned little bit of education, is it U.S. consumer, U.S. corporate market, is it channel sale in other markets, any more kind of feedback for us to help kind of navigate how to model this in the next few quarters?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes, sure. Gene, we\u2019re seeing, with an 84% Op year-over-year, we\u2019re seeing triple-digit growth rates in many, many geographies. Generally speaking, the international markets in the aggregate are extremely strong, in the triple-digits internationally. The U.S. is a bit lower, but I think it's important to keep in mind that the U.S. was on a faster adoption curve with iPad. And so we\u2019re thrilled with the numbers everywhere. Latin America is tripling. We\u2019re seeing growth out of the countries that are a bit border on being shocking in terms of the growth rate. We would not have dreamed of shipping over 17 million last quarter, and feel very, very good about it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Gene A. Munster \u2013 Piper Jaffray, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. And that's helpful. And did you give maybe I missed it, but did you give an Apple TV number for the quarter and any kind of updated thoughts, and how you're thinking about that going forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes, it's a good question. I didn\u2019t give it, but I can. We sold 1.3 million last quarter this was up over a 170% year-over-year, and it brings our fiscal year to 4 million units, which is pretty incredible. It's still at a level that we would call it a hobby. But we continue to pull the string to see where takes us and we\u2019re not one to keep around projects that we don't believe in. And so, there's a lot of people here that are believers in Apple TV and we continue to invest in it and see where it will take us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Gene A. Munster \u2013 Piper Jaffray, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So you don't do hobbies for the sake of hobbies, you do it to hope to get to be some bigger?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">That's right. We do it because we think we can, it will lead us somewhere. And so we'll see, I think this 4 million is not a small number, it's small relative to iPads and iPhones perhaps, but it\u2019s not a small number and there is a lot of believers in it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Gene A. Munster \u2013 Piper Jaffray, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Great, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yeah.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thanks, Gene. Could we have the next question, please<strong>?</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">From JPMorgan, we will go to Mark Moskowitz.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Mark A. Moskowitz \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes, thank you. The first question is around ASPs, the iPad and the iPhone, the blended ASPs seem to have declined a little more this quarter versus the prior quarters. Is that a function of the product portfolio or Apple just testing price elasticity as you expand into the emerging markets?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Hi, it\u2019s Peter. The iPhone ASP, we don\u2019t talk specifically about iPad and iPhone ASPs, but I would like to give you a little bit of color this quarter, because they did change some sequentially in the case of the iPad year-over-year. Beginning with the iPhone, the ASP was down due to a higher mix of lower priced models and a stronger U.S. dollar and that was the case generally on a sequential and a year-over-year. Regarding the mix, we believe that this was largely driven by all the new product rumors, economic conditions, particularly in Europe and we had a change in the ending inventory by models that also influence the ASPs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">For the iPad, it was down more year-over-year than it was sequentially. The year-over-year decrease was really attributable to four things. We had a higher mix of lower priced models, we reduced the price of the iPad 2 to $399, with our expanded distribution, we had a higher mix of indirect sales this year than we did a year ago and the dollar impacted us as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Mark A. Moskowitz \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay, thank you, Peter for that. Tim, I want to shift gears longer-term. You talked earlier about hobbies and their relevance, what about Passbook, I\u2019m not trying to imply that it\u2019s a hobby, but could Passbook be perceived as kind of a stepping stone to Apple, have any greater role in a digital wallet in terms of the structure?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yeah. I wouldn\u2019t want to comment specifically on that point, but Passbook in general is a very key feature. I think all of us have found that we were getting many passes and many tickets and so forth, they were scattered all over \u2013 maybe boarding passes, et cetera, they were scattered all over our iPhones in different apps. And so Passbook does an incredible job of pulling all of those to one place whether it\u2019s offers or passes or tickets or whatever it might be. And so it\u2019s a important feature of iOS 6 and I would want to speculate about where it might take us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Mark A. Moskowitz \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yeah.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thanks Mark. Could we have the next question, please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">From Deutsche Bank, we\u2019ll go to Chris Whitmore.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Chris Whitmore \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thanks very much. I wanted to follow-up on the pricing question and as specifically around the iPad as to whether or not you think the lower price point drove elasticity of demand for that product, in other words, were your sales incrementally higher or as a result of this economic environment, did you see customers migrate down market to lower-priced products, because spending is a little tighter these days?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Chris, it\u2019s Tim. The reason that we did it was because we believed that the sales would be incrementally larger that there was price elasticity and that there was a buyer that really wanted the best product and that needed it to be a little less expensive, and so I believe that we saw that. I think it did help our sales. I think it\u2019s particularly helping in K-12. The adoption rate of iPad in education is something I\u2019d never seen from any technology product in history. Usually, education tends to be a fairly conservative institution in terms of buying or K-12 does and we\u2019re not seeing that at all on the iPad. And so I think it was \u2013 it\u2019s been a big help for us and I am really glad that we did it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Chris Whitmore \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And just a follow-up, I wanted to ask about the opportunity that you see in India. A few years back, you talked about initial investments in China, and having cracked the China code, why hasn\u2019t Apple been more successful in India, and what is your outlook for growth in that geography specifically going forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">You know of course I love India, but I believe that Apple has some higher potential in the intermediate term in some other countries. And that doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re not putting emphasis in India, we are. We have a business there, that business is growing, but the sort of the multilayer distribution there really adds to the cost of getting products to market. And so, we\u2019re going to continue putting some energies there, but my own perspective is that in the intermediate term there will be larger opportunities outside of there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Chris Whitmore \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yeah.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Thanks, Chris. Could we have the next question, please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">From Sterne, Agee, we will hear from Shaw Wu.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Shaw Wu \u2013 Sterne, Agee &amp; Leach Group, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. Thanks for having on. Just a quick question in terms of component availability particularly new components? Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Shaw, it\u2019s Tim. We factored supply into the guidance that Peter has given you. Generally, I should say that we have been short of the MacBook Pro with the Retina displays, we ended the quarter with backlog and we are working really hard to deliver those to customers quickly and we believe that we will be in supply and demand balance in August.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">In terms of new products, I obviously don\u2019t talk about new products nor the parts that are in them, and so it\u2019s sort of a limit to what I can say there other than anything that we know about, we\u2019ve obviously included in the guidance and if we were short of something, you can bet that we would all be spending our energies on trying to mitigate that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Shaw Wu \u2013 Sterne, Agee &amp; Leach Group, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. Thanks for that color. Just a follow up on, I don't know if you could talk about in terms of the new iPad with the Retina display, I don\u2019t know, any constraints there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">The iPad, the new iPad ended the quarter in just over the four-week line, which we associated with our target of four to six weeks and \u2013 in terms of channel inventory. Now that said, as a reminder, we did not ship the new iPad in Mainland China until the quarter that we\u2019re now and in Q4, but in Q3, we feel like we ended in a balanced situation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Shaw Wu \u2013 Sterne, Agee &amp; Leach Group, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay, thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Last, could we have the next question, please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And that will come from Brian Marshall with ISI.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brian Marshall \u2013 ISI Group</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Great, thanks guys. Clearly Apple's design philosophy has been about building great products as opposed to kind of going in the market, hitting certain price points. But how do you think about the opportunities to address maybe some of those opportunities that are down at some of those lower price points, with your existing products without essentially compromising the core features that basically make Apple\u2019s products great.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Brian, it\u2019s Tim. Our North Star is to maniacally focus on making the world\u2019s best products and economic turmoil, may push us side to side, but we\u2019re going to stay on that journey and stay focused on making the best product, and not deviate from that. We\u2019ve seen, again and again throughout the years, that during these type of periods are where we distanced ourselves further from people that don\u2019t innovate and it increases the gap between us, and so that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Now, when we can do that and hit more aggressive price points, we\u2019re also going to do that. And I think you\u2019ve seen that with what we did with the $399 iPad, just a few months ago. And the iPhone 3GS is free in the United States, and in several other countries. And there has been quite a lot knocked off the price of that in certain other markets. And so, our North Star that will be making the best products in the world, and that\u2019s why we breathe, that\u2019s why we live and we\u2019re not changing that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Brian Marshall \u2013 ISI Group</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Thanks. And then, when you think about how the iPhone has penetrated the planet, obviously, we\u2019ve had some pretty phenomenal success, and some of that success, there\u2019s been some downside to that as well with respect to volatility about the rumors and speculation about kind of future products being announced. And so, could you talk a little bit about how you try to manage sort of the iPhone transitions and the carrier ramp as well, I mean obviously, you mentioned not going to be launching any major countries or carriers in the September quarter, but it\u2019s widely speculated that we\u2019re going to see something later on in the year. So if you can talk a little bit about how you kind of manage that whole sort of transition/carrier ramp up that would be great? Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Brian, we try very hard to keep our product roadmap secret and confidential, and we go to extreme, do extreme activities to try to do that. That however doesn\u2019t stop people from speculating or wondering and we\u2019ll never do that. And so it\u2019s a great thing about this country, people can say what they think and so forth. And so I'm not going to spend any energy trying to change that, that\u2019s just the environment we are in. I\u2019m glad that people want the next thing. I\u2019m super happy about it. And there is obviously, quite a few that what we\u2019re currently doing as well and as witnessed by the amount of products that we\u2019re selling. And so, I\u2019m not going to put any energy into try to get people to stop speculating. I don\u2019t think it would \u2013 I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to amount anything.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Brian Marshall \u2013 ISI Group</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yeah.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Thanks, Brian.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking today is Apple CFO, Peter Oppenheimer; and he'll be joined by Apple CEO, Tim Cook; and Treasurer, Gary Wipfler for the Q&amp;A session with analysts.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, stock-based compensation expense, taxes, earnings per share and future products.

Thank you for joining us. We're pleased to report the results of our fourth fiscal quarter. We established a new September quarter records for iPhone, iPad and Mac unit sales, leading to our highest September quarter revenue and earnings ever.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Revenue for the quarter was $36 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 27%. That's a $7.7 billion increase over the prior September quarter\u2019s results and was driven primarily by strong growth in iPhone and iPad sales.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Operating margin was $10.9 billion, representing 30.4% of revenue. Net income was $8.2 billion, increasing 24% over the prior September quarter's result. The quarter's net income translated to diluted earnings per share of $8.67.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Turning to the details of the quarter, I'd like to begin with our Mac products and services. We sold over 4.9 million Macs establishing a new September quarter record. This represents 1% growth year-over-year compared to IDC's latest published estimate of 8% contraction of the global personal computer market in the September quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Portable sales grew 9% year-over-year and represented an all time high of 80% of Mac unit mix, thanks to strong sales of MacBook Pro and MacBook Air.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Earlier this week we unveiled the stunning new design for iMac that packed high performance technology and a brilliant new display with reduced reflection into an incredibly sleek aluminum and glass enclosure. We also introduced an even thinner and lighter version of our most popular Mac, the 13-inch MacBook Pro, featuring a retina display with over 4 million pixels in all flash storage. We began and ended the quarter with between three and four weeks of Mac channel inventory which is below our target range of four to five weeks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Moving to our music products, we sold 5.3 million iPods compared to 6.6 million in the year ago quarter. iPod touch continue to account for over half of all iPods sold. iPod share of the U.S. market for MP3 players was over 70% in the September quarter based on the latest data published by MPD and iPod continue to be the top selling MP3 player in most countries we track based on the latest data published by GFK.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We\u2019re very excited to be shipping our newest iPods as of two weeks ago. The new iPod touch is the thinnest iPod touch yet, comes in five great colors and features of 4-inch Retina display, a 5 megapixel iSight camera, our powerful A5 chip and Siri. The new iPod Nano is the thinnest iPod ever featuring a 2.5-inch Multi-Touch display, convenient navigation buttons, and built-in Bluetooth for wireless listening. The Nano comes in seven great new colors and we think our full range of iPods will make wonderful gifts this holiday season.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">The iTunes Store generated all time record results, with revenue almost $2.1 billion thanks to continued strong sales of music, apps and video. We look forward to launching the new iTunes featuring the completely redesigned player, seamless integration with iCloud and a new look for the iTunes Store. The new iTunes has a dramatically simpler and clearner interface, so customers\u2019 music, movie and TV purchases on any of their iOS devices or computers are conveniently displayed in their iTunes library and are available whenever they want them.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">I\u2019d now like to turn to iPhone. we\u2019re very pleased to have sold 26.9 million iPhones compared to 17.1 million in the previous September quarter. That represents 58% year-over-year growth compared to IDC\u2019s latest published estimate of 45% growth for the smartphone market overall during the quarter. We launched iPhone 5 in nine countries on September 21 and 22 more countries on September 28, and demand has been phenomenal.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Customers have responded tremendously to the iPhone 5 all-new slim and light design and beautiful new 4-inch Retina display, the powerful performance of the A6 chip and the great new ultrafast wireless technology. Demand for iPhone 5 continues to outstrip supply, and we are working very hard to get more into customer\u2019s hands as quickly as possible.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We ended the quarter with about $9.1 million iPhones in channel inventory, a sequential increase of about 800,000 iPhones and ended the quarter below our target range of four to six weeks of iPhone channel inventory on a look-forward basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Recognized revenue from iPhone handsets and accessories sales was $17.1 billion during the quarter compared to $11 billion in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 56%. Businesses around the world continue to make iPhone, an essential device for their employees. Virtually, every type of enterprise in the small business is using iPhone along with the business apps from the app store and custom apps developed in-house to drive efficiencies that were simply not possible before.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Canon has provided its field sales team iPhones with secure access to its customer relationship management system, sales reps can now access customer information and input meeting notes anywhere giving them more time with customers. Amtrak has deployed thousands of iPhones to train conductors, the use an in-house app that changes the entire ticketing and reporting workflow. The app enabled print-at-home ticket validation delivers a more accurate passenger manifest and makes the accounting data available to Amtrak\u2019s revenue systems in near real time, revolutionizing the paper-based process, the company used in the past.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">And news organizations around the world are using iPhone to transform the way they capture and deliver news. reporters for BBC, the Wall Street Journal, Mexican newspaper, Milenio and Canada\u2019s CTV News are using their iPhone cameras to capture HD video on location and send it directly back to headquarters for broadcast on TV or streaming on the web.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to iPad, we were very pleased with sales of 14 million iPads during the September quarter compared to 11.1 million in the year ago quarter and the increase of 26%. iPad sales were ahead of our expectations and we saw a strong year-over-year growth in iPad sales in every geographic region.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Earlier this week, we introduced the iPad Mini, the thinnest, lightest, smallest iPad we\u2019ve ever build. it has all the power, performance and capability, customers have come to expect from an iPad and you can hold it in one hand. We also introduced the fourth generation iPad with the beautiful 9.7-inch Retina display, an A6 chip with twice the performance of the iPad we announced earlier this year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Together with the iPad 2, these two new iPads run more than 275,000 apps in the App Store. Recognized revenue from sales of iPad and iPad accessories during the quarter was 7.5 billion compared to 6.9 billion in the year-ago quarter and the increase of 9%. we ended the quarter with about 3.4 million iPads in channel inventory, a sequential increase of about 200,000, which left as just over our four weeks of iPad channel inventories, target on a look-back basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">iPad is fundamentally changing work processes across industries around the world. With apps developed in-house, iPad is helping companies deliver better service; streamline manufacturing and then power workforces with critical data and information.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Volkswagen has developed more than 30 in-house apps for vital processes across the company including monitoring and tracking of vehicles on the production line, scheduling the vehicle transportation at assembly plants and greeting customers when they pick up new cars. Ping An Insurance in China has deployed thousands of iPads to their sales agents and service teams.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Apps developed in-house are used by car accident inspectors to carry out onsite inspections involve claims, which significantly shortens processing time and improves customer satisfaction. In Brazil, Banco Bradesco is using iPads to redefine the customer experience in their bank branches. Beyond completing customer transaction, employees use iPad to inform and educate customers about bank services, and Bradesco apps in the App Store.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Combining iPhones, iPads and iPod touch, we sold over 44 million iOS devices in the September quarter. The App Store now offers more than 700,000 apps, including over 275,000 apps specifically for iPad. We established a new all-time record for quarterly app sales in the September quarter, and we were very pleased to report that we have reached $6.5 billion in cumulative payments to developers. Customers are embracing iPad in growing numbers. With over 190 million account sign ups in the first year of the service.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">With iCloud, customers can access their music, photos, calendars, contacts, documents and more from whatever device they are using. And it is built into every new iOS device and every new Mac. And we launched iOS6 last month, and it\u2019s already on over 200 million devices. iOS 6 includes over 200 new features, including broader language support for Siri, Facebook integration, shared photo streams and more. We\u2019ve made a number of improvements in maps over the past month, and we will work non-stop until maps lives up to our incredibly high standards.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">I would now like to turn to the Apple retail stores. Revenue was $4.2 billion, which is a new September quarter record and an increase of 18% over the year-ago quarter, with growth yield primarily by the store\u2019s best iPhone launch ever. The stores also established a new quarterly record for Mac sales, selling just over 1.1 million Macs. We opened a total of 18 new stores in 10 countries during the quarter, including our first store in Sweden. We also opened our second store at Hong Kong, at Festival Walk overwhelming response, resulting in our biggest store opening of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We exited the quarter with 390 stores, 140 of which are outside the United States. With an average of 376 stores open, average revenue per store was $11.2 million, compared to $10.7 million in the year-ago quarter. Segment margin was $848 million, compared to $652 million in the year-ago quarter. We hosted 94 million visitors to our stores during the quarter, compared to 77.5 million visitors in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 22%. That translates to an average of 19,000 visitors per store, per week.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Total company gross margin was 40%, which was 150 basis points higher than our guidance. About half this difference was due to better than expected, commodity and other costs. Another quarterly difference was due to leverage on the higher-than-expected sales and more favorable foreign exchange. The remainder was due to some items that we do not expect to recur in the December quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Operating expenses were $3.5 billion, and included $379 million of stock-based compensation expense. OI&amp;E was a net expense to $51 million. The interest income and investment gains were more than offset by higher-than-expected currency hedging expense. Under the accounting rules, foreign exchange fluctuations late in the quarter required us to accelerate recognition of premium expense related to Q1 and Q2 hedges. This will result in less premium expense being recognized in Q1 and Q2 the tax rate for the quarter was 24.5%, bringing us to a tax rate for the full fiscal year of 25.2%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to cash, our cash for short-term and long-term marketable securities totaled $121.3 billion at the end of the September quarter, compared to $117.2 billion at the end of the June quarter, a sequential increase of over $4 billion. The increase in cash was net of $2.5 billion of dividend paid in August. About $83 billion of our total cash was offshore at the end of the September quarter. Cash flow from operations was $9.1 billion. Our board of directors have declared a dividend of $2.65 per common share, payable on November 15, 2012. The shareholders of recorded as of the close of business on November 12, 2012.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In August, we entered into a rule 10b5-1 compliant accelerated share repurchase program, with the financial institution to purchase out the $2 billion of Apple stock during fiscal year \u201913.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In addition to shares purchased through the accelerated share repurchase program, we may also purchase shares in open market transaction in compliance with our applicable securities laws. As we move ahead into the December quarter, I\u2019d like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. As a reminder, year-over-year comparison will be impacted by the fact that our December quarter this year will span 13 weeks, whereas the December quarter last year included a 14<sup>th</sup> week.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As we indicated previously, revenue in that 14<sup>th </sup>week last year was approximately one 14<sup>th</sup> of the quarter\u2019s total revenue. We expect revenues to be about $52 billion compared to $46.3 billion in the December quarter last year. We expect gross margin to be about 36% reflecting approximately $90 million related to stock-based compensation expense.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We expect OpEx to be about $4.05 billion including about $485 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OI&amp;E to be about $380 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%. We are targeting EPS of about $11.75.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In closing, we\u2019re extremely proud to conclude an amazing fiscal year 2012. We generated revenue of over $156 billion, which is up 45% year-over-year, and reflects growth of $48 billion in revenue. We sold over $200 million iOS devices including 125 million iPhones reflecting 73% growth year-over-year, and 58 million iPads reflecting 80% growth.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We sold a record $18 million Macs and shipped 35 million iPods. And we expanded the reach of iTunes music stores to 63 countries around the world. We launched stunning new versions of OS X and iOS, and time it altogether; we launched iPod with customers reaching over 190 million and growing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">And finally, we generated net income of $41.7 billion, an increase of 61% year-over-year. We enter this holiday season with our strongest product lineup ever and remain very confident in our new product pipeline.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">With that, I\u2019d like to open the call to questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Thank you, Peter. And we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Operator, may we have the first question, please?</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p5\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">(Operator Instructions) Your first question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Katy Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC\t</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. If your guidance comes to fruition, December will be the first quarter in a very long time, but Apple EPS declined year-on-year despite what has been the broadest product refresh in the company\u2019s history over the past two months, the [bares] will point out that may be the company\u2019s price premium or supply kind of advantage is weakening, so just curious how you would respond to that? And then as a follow-up, Peter if you can comment on what\u2019s driving the significant gross margin down-tick in December given you should have decent iPhone mix? Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Sure. Katy, let me begin, I\u2019ll address many of the things you asked, and then Tim can add a few points. The change year-over-year is being driven by a couple of things, so first of all, last year included a 14<sup>th</sup> week, this year\u2019s Q1 is a normal 13-week quarter. That along with a stronger U.S. dollar, and the change in gross margin, so let me talk to you about what we see for gross margin, but I\u2019m going to go through some detail on a sequential basis, but not year-over-year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">As you pointed out, this is the most prolific product period in Apple\u2019s history. We have an unprecedented number of new product introductions over the last six weeks, and this has led to record levels of demand. New or re-priced versions of our products announced during this time frame represent over 80% of the total expected December quarter revenue.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">But there are costs associated with such dramatic change and demand. The iPhone 5, iPad Mini, iMac, MacBook Pro 13-inch, iPod Touch and iPod Nano have completely new form factors with great new features, and we\u2019ve never before introduced so many new form factors at once. All of these products have higher costs than their predecessors, and therefore lower gross margins as they are at the height of the cost curve.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">This has been the case with new products in the past, so nothing new. The difference this time is the sheer number of new products we are introducing in a very short period of time. Additionally, we lowered the price of the iPhone 4S and iPhone 4, delivering incredible value to our customer.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We head into this holiday quarter with the strongest iPhone line-up that we have ever had with the iPhone 4 starting at three in the subsidized markets. We also added the iPad Mini to our iPad line-up. The iPad Mini has the full iPad experience, and we priced it aggressively at $329, delivering incredible value to our customers. Its gross margin is significantly below the corporate average.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So in summary, we expect our gross margin to decline by about 400 basis points sequentially. We expect the benefit from positive leverage on a sequentially higher revenue and a greater mix of iPhone, but we expect these benefits will be more than offset by a number of factors.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">First, margins on new products are lower than their predecessors including the iPhone 5 and we have been aggressive with the iPad Mini. Second, we\u2019ve lowered the price of the iPhone 4S and the iPhone 4. Third, we will experience transitionary cost associated with multiple new product ramp. Fourth, the high anticipated volume of iPhone and other new products will generate significantly greater deferred revenue sequentially.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">As you are aware, we defer a portion of our revenue with every device we sell, and amortize it back into revenue over the life of the device. In periods of exceptionally strong sales like the December quarter, the deferred amounts are significantly higher than the revenue amortized in from past sales. And fifth, the favorable items that benefited the gross margin in the September quarter are not expected to repeat in the December quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We will work hard to try and get down the cost curves and improve our manufacturing and other efficiencies as we successfully have done in the past. We ended this holiday season with our strongest product line-up ever, and we have great choices for customers. To be in a position to anticipate over $50 billion of demand for our products in a single quarter is a reflection of the incredible strength of our products and our business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">And Katy, if I could just add a couple of things to that. We are dedicated to making the very best products in the world, and we think about the smallest of details, and we are unwilling to cut corners in delivering the best customer experience to the world. It\u2019s this relentless commitment to innovation and excellence is the reason that our customers choose buy our products, and this will always be the driving force behind Apple. We are managing the company for the long-run and will continue to make great long-term decision. We remain very, very confident in our strategy, and will use our world-class skills and hardware, software and services to delight our customers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Katy Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC\t</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Thanks for the details.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Thanks, Katy. Can we have the next question please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">From Goldman Sachs, we\u2019ll go to Bill Shope.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Bill C. Shope \u2013 Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay, great. Thanks. Can you walk through how you\u2019re thinking about the supply ramp for the iPhone 5 in the holiday quarter? And how does some of the challenges you\u2019re facing relative to the strong demand compared to the past iOS product launches?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Hi Bill, it\u2019s Tim. The demand for iPhone is extremely robust, we are thrilled with what we see; we are in a significant state of backlog right now. In terms of the production, our output has improved significantly since earlier this month. And I\u2019m very, very pleased with the progress that we\u2019ve made there; I\u2019m pleased with the current level of output in what is the largest volume ramp in Apple\u2019s history. It\u2019s difficult to predict when supply and demand will balance, but I\u2019m feeling very confident on our ability to supply quite a few iPhones.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Bill C. Shope \u2013 Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Great, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Thanks, Bill. Can we have the next question please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Next we\u2019ll go to Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Toni M. Sacconaghi \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Yes, thank you. I just wanted to first follow-up on that previous question around the ramp of iPhone. Do you continue to anticipate rolling out to all 100 countries this quarter as you had announced at the time of the iPhone 5 announcement. And related to that can you comment on whether the supply constraints that you\u2019ve had, have had a material impact on your cost of goods sold relative. So as your supply improves, do you actually expect your cost of goods sold to decline?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Tony, it\u2019s Tim. In regard to your first question, we still continue to anticipate rolling out to the 100 countries as we announced before, it is our fastest rollout ever; there will be some large countries in month of December. But we anticipate still achieving the 100. In terms of costs, with each new product we see learning curves associated with ramping production.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">And the new products we have now are no exception to that, the difference is the number of new products that we having moving in line. As Peter said, and as you can talk, the announcements we\u2019ve had the last couple of months, this is the most prolific period in our history in terms of the new product introduction and innovation; the past six weeks have been phenomenal in terms of new product introduction.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And so we do see all of these costs associated with each of these. But I don\u2019t see those costs accelerating on a per unit basis. As we got through the quarter, I see it very much being a production ramp across many, many new products.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Toni M. Sacconaghi \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay, thank you for that color. If I could just follow-up, you\u2019ve talked before about how you believe that the iPad will be, and the tablet market will be an enormous market, bigger than the PC market. Clearly, you\u2019ve made a move to expand that market and make it more accessible by introducing the iPad Mini. I\u2019m wondering if over time you could see this market evolving to larger tablets going forward that would address different needs in the marketplace, take on incremental PC functionality, and I\u2019m wondering when you talk about the iPad market being bigger than the PC market going forward, do you see larger form factors in the marketplace evolving, and I guess the question, is why not?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Tony, as you know we don\u2019t comment on our future views on products and roadmaps etcetera. But let me make some comments on your question. We continue to be very confident that the tablet market will surpass the PC market, there is incredible development in both ecosystems and product going on in the tablet space. It is already extremely compelling for many, many customers to choose the tablet, in particular an iPad over a PC. And when you look at the size of the PC market, there is an enormous opportunity for Apple there. Pretty much each quarter you see 80 to 90 million PCs being sold.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And so we do think that the iPad and the iPad Mini, and the iPad 2 will all be extremely attractive offering for people in lieu of PC. And we are going to continue to very much focus on the future of iPad, and we are very, very confident with what we have in the pipeline. And we are extremely pleased to have launched iPad Mini; and can\u2019t wait until next Friday, when we begin selling the very first unit.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Thanks, Tony.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Toni M. Sacconaghi \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Can we have the next question, please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">From Cross Research, Shannon Cross.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Shannon S. Cross \u2013 Cross Research LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Thank you very much. Tim or Peter could you talk a little bit about China, and what you\u2019re seeing in China fairly with your revenue guidance, it sounds like it remained strong, but obviously there\u2019s been some mixed signal from an economic standpoint?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Yeah Shannon, it\u2019s Tim. In terms of what we saw in China for Q4, revenue was $5.7 billion, that\u2019s up 26% year-on-year, Mac was up extremely strong, up 44%. As you recall, we launched portables for the first time in July or the portables that we have previously announced in U.S. in June, we announced that in China in July. iPad was up 45% in Greater China, iPhone was up 38%. And so all in all, a fantastic quarter that brings us to a full year fiscal year revenue number of $23.8 billion for China which is really phenomenal, when you think about it, that\u2019s up over $10 billion year-on-year up 78% and Greater China now represents about 15% of Apple for the fiscal year and so we\u2019re extremely happy with how we\u2019ve done in China as Peter alluded to in his opening remarks, we are continuing to invest in our own retail stores there, we continue to expand distribution in with channel partners as well, and we continue to see it as a extremely exciting market with more and more people wanting Apple product.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Shannon S. Cross \u2013 Cross Research LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Great, and then I just had a follow-up question on the Tablet market, with the launch of Surface today and obviously the Win 8 Tablet of Mac, could you talk a little bit about what are you seeing, from a competitive standpoint and how you think about it? Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yeah, I haven\u2019t personally played with the Surface yet, but what we\u2019re reading about it is that it\u2019s a fairly compromised confusing product, and so I think one of the toughest things you do with deciding which product is to make hard trade off and decide what a product should be and we\u2019ve really done that with the iPad, and so the user experience is absolutely incredible, I suppose you could design a car that flies and floats, but I don\u2019t think it would do all of those things very well, and so I think people when they look at the iPad versus competitive offerings are going to conclude, they really want an iPad and I think people have done that to-date and I think they will continue to do that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Shannon S. Cross \u2013 Cross Research LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thanks, Shannon, can we have the next question please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">From Barclays, we\u2019ll go to Ben Reitzes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Benjamin Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thanks a lot, appreciate it. Can you just go through a little bit more on tablets, the iPad Mini, how do you think that will sell versus the original iPad form factor and how do you want to differentiate that is there more of an eBook focus with and education focus with the Mini and do you think it will sell more than the regular or the original iPad and how do you want us to just think about the cannibalization factor as well of the older product or the older form factor?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">We don\u2019t really have an old product, then we have only new product, we just announced the fourth generation iPad as well and\u2026</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Benjamin Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yeah, I knew, I do, I\u2019d messed up in my speech there sorry.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So, no, but the way that we look at this is that we provide a fantastic iPad Touch, we provide an incredible fourth generation iPad and iPad Mini and then iPad 2. Customers will decide which one or two or three or all four that they would like and will buy those and so we\u2019ve learned over the years not to worry about cannibalization of our own products, it\u2019s much better for us to do that than somebody else to do it and the far, far bigger opportunity here are the 80 million to 90 million PCs that are being sold per quarter, there\u2019s still over 300 million PCs being bought per year, and I think a great number of those people would be much better of buy an iPad or a Mac, and so that\u2019s a much bigger opportunity for Apple, and so instead of being focused on cannibalizing ourselves, and I look at it in much more that it\u2019s an enormous incremental opportunity for us and so that\u2019s how I look at it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Benjamin Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay, and then just my quick follow-up is on Apple TV we haven\u2019t heard about your hobby in [Vaio] how many did you sell in the quarter and what\u2019s the strategy there for the living room to-date and I\u2019m intrigued to hear the answer or not an answer?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Or not you might guess, for Q4 we sold 1.3 million that is up over a 100% year-on-year that means that we sold up more than 5 million Apple TVs during the fiscal year, which is almost double the previous year, we have sold 2.8 the previous year and so the business continues to do very well, but if you look at the size of revenue of this business versus our other businesses, it\u2019s quite small and so it still has the (inaudible) label, however it\u2019s below Toby and we continue to focus on it and continue to believe there is something more there and continue to pull the string to see where it takes us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Benjamin Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thanks a lot, Tim.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yeah.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thanks, Ben. Can we have the next question please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Moving on we\u2019ll hear from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Charles Eugene Munster \u2013 Piper Jaffray</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hey good afternoon. Tim, can you talk a little bit about the iPad we saw a deceleration in September quarter. Was there anything in particular that might have been, as do you think about that business might have been driving that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">The June to September was 17 million to 14 million Gene and the first thing to know there is that as we had talked about in the July call, the June quarter contained 1.2 million increase in channel inventory and so the actual sell through sequentially looks, the comparison looks very different than the our reported sell in numbers do, the second thing is that the $14 million exceeded what we had expected to do in iPad and the reason we had expected it to decline is that we believe based on the two or three years of results that we\u2019ve got is that normally, we would see a seasonal reduction in the September quarter versus the June quarter, a part of this reason is because K-12 heavily buys in the June quarter, K-12 doesn\u2019t buy very much in the September quarter, it becomes the Higher Ed kind of move and Higher Ed is still buying notebooks for the most part, and so there is some kind of normal seasonal that\u2019s exaggerated further when we announced the new product in March and have an enormous full quarter of demand in the June quarter and then when you compare that to the September quarter there would be natural phase down.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">In addition to all of that, people it\u2019s clear that customers delayed purchases of tablets due to new product rumors and this intensified in August and September. Some of that was anticipated and some of it I wish wouldn\u2019t occur. But it did occur.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And so that\u2019s how we would explain the sequential difference. On a year-over-year basis because of the year ago quarter having also a channel inventory build as we stock the channel to the profit level the sell through year-over-year actually grew 44% and so the underlying sell through was extremely strong.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And so we continue to feel great about how iPad has done and with announcing the fourth generation iPads just as we and adding iPad Mini to the family, we think it\u2019s going to be an incredible holiday season.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Charles Eugene Munster \u2013 Piper Jaffray</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay, great, thank you, and then my follow-up question is given what we\u2019re seeing in margins that some of these products get more expensive to produce to be competitive, would you be open to passing some of those cost on to customers and obviously historically you\u2019ve announced new products and maintain a lot of those price points?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">It\u2019s a hypothetical question, hence so we think, we\u2019ve made great choices on the product and the prices and as you know our customary practice, long-standing customary practice is just to guide for the current quarter, and so I would want to talk about what we might do post that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Charles Eugene Munster \u2013 Piper Jaffray</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Great, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thanks, Gene.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thank you, Gene. We have the next question please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">From JPMorgan, we\u2019ll go to Mark Moskowitz.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Mark A. Moskowitz \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yeah, thank you, good afternoon. Peter or Tim my first question is around the sequential guidance for revenue of around 44% quarter-on-quarter for December. Can you provide us some context about how we should think about the iPad and the iPhone families in particular? How their revenue growth could [down tail] of that 44%?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Hi, Mark. It\u2019s Peter. You\u2019re asking the sequential question, but I do want just to remind everybody that if you are looking at this year-over-year and comparing the sequential year-over-year, don\u2019t forget about the 14<sup>th</sup> week, last year in Q1, you need to adjust for that. And I think it would give you a different answer, if you were comparing anything year-over-year. Specifically, your question about iPhone and iPad sequentially, we have just announced amazing new products in both lineups and we expect large sequential increases, going from the September to December quarter. And as a result, what\u2019s real to be providing guidance tonight for $52 billion of revenue.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Mark A. Moskowitz \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. And then Tim, question on the iPhone 5, as far as just the global rollout, what is the approach, the approach is the first touch all 100 countries and have supply constraints, impacting all 100 countries first and then go back and back still all those different outlets or will there be certain markets where you decide to kind of reach the supply-demand equilibrium first, and then keep similar sort of 100 countries kind of at constrained levels. I\u2019m just kind of curious about the efforts there in terms of. In terms of (inaudible)<strong> </strong>first sprinkle the product everywhere and then back the later or will it be more targeted?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">What we did initially Mark, as we planned the first 30 to 40 countries prior to introducing the product and roll those out across at September in two different dates. The balance of the quarter, we planned with an eye toward the supply and what we think the demand will be. But we do plan these in advance and so it is not a pr\u00e9cised science. And we obviously have to plan those with several weeks of notice. And so occasionally, it can be different than what we think.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Mark A. Moskowitz \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yeah.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Thanks, Mark. Can we have the next question please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We\u2019ll go to Steve Milunovich with UBS.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Steven M Milunovich \u2013 UBS Securities LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Thank you very much. Regarding the iPad, you said that you priced it very aggressively. I think many people on The Street seem to have a slightly different view. Could you maybe talk a little about your pricing philosophy? And was it driven by cost? Or is it just more to keep up a premium brand, given the quality of your products?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Steve, it\u2019s Peter. When we set out the bill, the iPad Mini, we didn\u2019t set out the bill to small cheap tablet, we set out the bill to smaller iPad that offers the full iPad experience as our customers would expect. As a result, the difference between the iPad Mini and the competition is profound, our iPad Mini begins with a 7.9 inch display, which is 35% larger than 7 inch tablets, providing a much better experience. We\u2019re shipping two great cameras: FaceTime HD front and a 5 megapixel of 1080p iSight rear camera versus typically a one from our competition. We are shipping our fastest communications with dual-band Wi-Fi and have included the A5 chip, which has higher performance than our competitors. And finally, the fit and finish of our precision, unibody aluminum closure is breathtaking when held in your hands.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And so that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done. The iPad Mini has higher costs and the gross margin is significantly below our cooperate average, we\u2019re beginning the higher cost curve, but in addition to wanting to make a large number, we\u2019re going to work to try and get down the cost curves and be more efficient in manufacturing as we have been in the past with our other products.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Steve, one of the things we try to do is to create a product that people will love for months and years after they purchase it and continue using it in a robust way. So that\u2019s what iPad Mini has been designed to do. And you can really see that more broadly on iPad by looking at the usage statistics, as I had mentioned earlier this week, over 90% of the web traffic from tablets are from iPad. And so, Apple will not make a product that somebody may feel good about it for the moment that they\u2019re paying for it and then when they get it home, they really ever use AVR, that\u2019s not what we\u2019re about, it\u2019s not a kind of experience we want our customers to have. And I think when you \u2013 I would encourage you to use an iPad Mini and I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be using anything other than maybe another iPad or something after you do that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Steven M Milunovich \u2013 UBS Securities LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I look forward to it. could you comment on your enterprise opportunity or obviously a lot of its BYOD, but you have many retailers, you have a corporate director to use iPads and so forth. are you doing anything a little bit more aggressive to support that market particularly with the Windows pads now coming out?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">We now have almost all of the Fortune 500 that are testing or deploying iPad and I think with the recent announcements, the penetration will only grow. We\u2019ve also pushed fairly aggressively in the Global 500. And so those numbers now are above 80% on both iPhone and iPad. And so I feel like we are doing fairly well there, there is clearly much more to do. But I\u2019m feeling pretty good about it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Steven M Milunovich \u2013 UBS Securities LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thanks, Steve. Could we have the next question, please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">From Bank of America Merrill Lynch, we\u2019ll hear from Scott Craig.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Scott D. Craig \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Hey, thanks, good afternoon. Tim, maybe comment on the component environment a little bit particularly, related to the iPad, iPad Mini and iPhone and just where you see some of the constraints perhaps here as you\u2019re launching. And then Peter, the quick one for you, the volatility on the OI&amp;E line. is that just the calendar third quarter and calendar fourth quarter issue, and then it normalizes or is that going to continue? Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Scott, it\u2019s Tim. In terms of iPad and iPhone, I don\u2019t see a component shortage getting us for the quarter in the numbers that we\u2019ve given you in the guidance. I think we saw some challenges there and feel good about our position. In terms of general shortages on the iMac, we\u2019ll be constrained for the full quarter in a significant way, part of that is that we\u2019re beginning shipping the 21.5-inch iMac in November and the 27-inch in December. And so there will be a short amount of time during the quarter to manufacturer and ramp those and I expect the demand to be robust. So we will have a significant shortage there. the others are more based on how big is big from a demand point of view and that is very difficult to predict, but you can tell that we\u2019re extremely bullish on the demand with the revenue guidance that Peter talked about earlier. Hopefully that answers your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Scott D. Craig \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Gary Wipfler</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Hey, Scott. This is Gary. I\u2019ll take the OI&amp;E question. Okay, I\u2019ll expand on Peter\u2019s remarks just a little bit while interest income was above what we expected, foreign exchange hedging expense was higher than we expected relative to our guidance. without getting overly detailed, dollar weakness late in the quarter and accounting rules required us to accelerate and recognize a large amount of foreign exchange premium expense related to future quarter hedges in the current quarter. All things being equal, premium expense in Q1 should be lower. This has been factored into our December OI&amp;E guidance of $380 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thanks, Gary and thanks, Scott. Could we have the next question, please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">From ISI Group, we\u2019ll hear from Brian Marshall.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Brian Marshall \u2013 ISI Group</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Great, thanks guys. If you look at the iPhone, unit growth versus the revenue growth, that\u2019s been a pretty similar dynamic over the past several quarters, but when you look at that same dynamic for the iPad, it\u2019s actually started to breakdown slightly over the past couple of quarters in fact, this most recent quarter, it looks like revenues grew three times faster than the unit growth. So I guess the question is, is this just simply the market migrating down to the sort of low-end of this skew stack or just less accessories from an attached or dollar spent in that and a quick follow up.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Brian it\u2019s Peter. I didn't quite follow your three times, but the iPhone ASPs were relatively flat in the September quarter, year-on-year and were up slightly on a sequential basis. The iPad ASPs were down year-over-year in a low double-digit way, but this really was reflective of our price reduction on the iPad 2 the stronger dollar and a little bit of change in mix and that's what drove the ASP change year-over-year on a sequential basis. iPad ASPs were actually pretty flat.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brian Marshall \u2013 ISI Group</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Great thanks, and then a quick follow-up is, looks like this is the second quarter in a row that the United States iPhone activations is actually growing faster than the international market that kind of seems like a strange dynamic considering the magnitude of the turn of the international being order magnitude larger than the U.S., one of you could comment on that, thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I think it's important to remember there that we launched iPhone 5 in the U.S. during the quarter and where we launched in some international countries the bulk of the world we did not launch it yet and so I would have expected to have seen a more significant growth in the U.S. versus the rest of the world.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brian Marshall \u2013 ISI Group</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Thanks Brian, could we have the next question please.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">From Bank of Montreal, we\u2019ll go to Keith Bachman.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Keith Bachman \u2013 BMO Capital Markets</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Hi thank you. A clarification question, will the iPhone 5 launch in Mainland China occur in the December quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Keith, it's Tim. Yes we project that it will occur in December.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Keith Bachman \u2013 BMO Capital Markets</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay thanks and the clarification on top of that, did you comment that you think you'll be able to meet supply of iPhone's at the end of the December quarter or do you think that you will end the quarter with backlogs of iPhone 5, or iPhones I should just say it's as a product's category?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I'm actually not projecting whether supply and demand will balance for the quarter, I'm saying that I feel great about where we are on the manufacturing ramp that our supply output is significantly higher than it was earlier in October, and I'm confident that we'll be able to supply quite a few during the quarter, but in terms of where that, when that balance occurs, I can't tell at this point.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Keith Bachman \u2013 BMO Capital Markets</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Demand is very robust.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Keith Bachman \u2013 BMO Capital Markets</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay, thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Thank you<strong> </strong>Keith. Could we have the next question, please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">From Deutsche Bank, we\u2019ll go to Chris Whitmore.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Chris K. Whitmore \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Thanks very much. Tim I wanted to go back to the iPad one more time if I could, specifically I wanted to ask or try to give us a feel for your view around the emerging model in the tablets base where vendors are willing to subsidize their hardware with content or search, where many of these vendors are selling hardware that break-even or even a loss and hoping they make it up on the back end, how is that impacting your iPad business if at all and is that something Apple would consider going forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">We've seen low-cost challenges before and iPad continues to beat every other tablet on the market, it can be any price and so we think customers are very smart, we think they have very high expectations, we think that they want a device that can do more and we are confident that our focus on making the best product is what will win at the end of the day and so we will stay true to that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Chris K. Whitmore \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay and then my second question I wanted to ask about the supply, it sounds like you've made a lot of changes to your supplier list as these new products are ramping perhaps due to strategic reasons and is that creating an added layer of complexity as you try to ramp these new products and to what extent is that contributing perhaps to the higher cost structure of these products?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I'm not sure what you're trying to get out there, but I would not say that there has been a significant change in our supplier partners. There is always some change obviously, but I wouldn't describe any change as significant and there hasn't been a change that would have driven more cost, if that\u2019s your specific question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Chris K. Whitmore \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I was specifically asking about LCD in your Samsung relationship?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">LCD, I wouldn\u2019t characterize any change there, it\u2019s having driven any cost. And Samsung, we continue to be a customer of Samsung and continue to have a commercial relationship.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Chris K. Whitmore \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Welcome.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Thanks, Chris. Could we have the next question, please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">We\u2019ll go to Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Kulbinder Garcha \u2013 Credit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Thanks. My first question, I guess is for Tim. Just in terms on the iPad Mini, there has obviously been a fair amount of debate within Apple over the years whether to even do the smaller screen iPad. And I guess, can you just speak about what you\u2019ve learned over the last couple of years as to why the time for that now is right, or was the technology is right? Just any insight there will be helpful. And then for Peter, my question is on gross margin that\u2019s<strong> </strong>when we revisit it<strong> </strong>slightly in the sense that you guys have spoken about various higher cost structures before as well in the loop from I think the 3G as to the fall in the iPhone. And even when the iPad I think was launched. During the end, what we\u2019ve seen is that the scaled Apple<strong> </strong>building<strong>, </strong>tighter revenues are getting to the component we use<strong> </strong>as<strong>, </strong>do you<strong> </strong>actually very quickly got through these potential gross margin dips. Is anything scripturally different this time around many things?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">On your question about iPad Mini, the comment that I think you\u2019re referencing are comments that Steve had made before about 7-inch tablet. And let me be clear, we would not make one of the 7-inch tablets. We don\u2019t think they\u2019re good products, and we would never make one. Not just because it\u2019s 7-inches, but for many reasons. One of the reasons however, is size,<strong> </strong>and<strong> </strong>so I am not sure if you saw our keynote. But the difference in just the realistic size between the 7.9, almost 8 versus 7 is 35%. And when you look at the usable area, it\u2019s much greater than that. It\u2019s from 50% to 67%. And also, the iPad Mini has the same number of pixels as iPad 2 does.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And so you have access to all 275,000 apps that are in our App Store that have been custom-designed to take advantage of the four (inaudible). And so iPad Mini is the fantastic product. it\u2019s not a compromised product like the 7-inch tablets; it\u2019s in our whole different leap.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Kulbinder, the sequential declining in gross margin that we see in the December quarter is largely being driven by many new form factor changes and some price reductions that we\u2019ve taken that I went through in great detail. And we believe that over 80% of the revenue that we will see in the December quarter will come from products that we\u2019ve just introduced in the last six weeks. And so while having lower gross margins on a new product is not something that\u2019s new for us. What is different this time is just a sheer<strong> </strong>number of new products that we\u2019ve introduced in the last six weeks. And we just have not had that magnitude in the past. So I don\u2019t see something that\u2019s structurally different. And we have a big focus on wanting to make a lot of these products to get them in customers\u2019 hands as quickly as we can. But we are often going to work to try and get down the cost curves and improve manufacturing and other efficiencies as we have successfully done in the past. So no change in what we\u2019re going to try and work on. And we\u2019ll report to you in January how we did.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Kulbinder Garcha \u2013 Credit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Thank you, Kulbinder.

We are incredibly pleased to report an extraordinary quarter with $54.5 billion in revenue and new records for iPhone and the iPad sales. No technology company has ever reported these kinds of results.<br><br>Apple is in one of the most prolific periods of innovation of new products in its history. Just in the last few months, we have introduced new products in every category that we make. Each one of these reflects our dedication to making the very best products in the world. At Apple, we think about the smallest details and we are unwilling to cut corners in delivering the best customer experience in the world. This relentless commitment to innovation and excellence is the reason our customers choose to buy our product and this will always be the driving force behind Apple.<br><br>Apple today is over 80,000 people strong and we are one team working together to surprise and delight our customers. Part of my job is to preserve our culture and drive it forward, so we remain the world\u2019s most innovative company. People join Apple to do the very best work of their life and there is no greater reward than seeing how customers love to use our products. We continue to believe that our fundamental, our remarkable people, our clear and focused strategy, our new product pipeline, our booming ecosystem, and more than 400 Apple retail stores will serve us well in the coming months and years ahead.<br><br>Tomorrow marks the anniversary of a revolution. On January 24, 1984, Steve introduced the first Macintosh right here at a shareholder meeting in Cupertino. On the evening news that night, they said it was supposed to be one of the easiest computers to use, and thanks to the new mouse, you hardly have to touch the keyboard. We have come a long way since 1984, but we rely on the same spirit and drive that brought the original Mac and other revolutionary products like the iPod, the iPhone and the iPad into the world.<br><br>You are going to hear a lot of impressive numbers during this call, but they are not the only way that we measure success at Apple. The most important thing to us is that our customers love our product, not just buy them, but love them. Everyone here is laser focused on creating an unprecedented customer experience. We have now sold well over 0.5 billion iOS devices, including a staggering 10 per second last quarter alone. We couldn\u2019t have achieved these milestones without the very best products in the world and unmatched execution by our engineering operations and sales teams to deliver so many innovative and beautifully designed products. It\u2019s simply phenomenal.<br><br>Everyone at Apple has their eyes on the future, a future driven by the incredible hard work and dedication by the most talented and creative team on earth who all share a common purpose of continuing to create the world\u2019s best product and in doing so enrich the lives of our customers. Today we\u2019re proud to share with you our latest results. Peter will review the highlights of our Q1 earnings and I\u2019ll be back for the Q&amp;A. Peter.<br><br><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><br>Thanks Tim. We\u2019re very pleased to report the results of Apple\u2019s first fiscal quarter. We established new all-time quarterly records for iPhone and iPad sales, significantly broadened our eco-system and generated Apple\u2019s highest quarterly revenue and net income ever. Revenue for the quarter was 54.5 billion compared to 46.3 billion in the year ago quarter, an increase of 8.2 billion year-over-year. As a remainder our first quarter this fiscal year spanned 13 weeks whereas the first quarter last year included a 14th week. As such average weekly revenue was 4.2 billion in the current year quarter compared to 3.3 billion in the year ago quarter, an increase of 27%. The strong year-over-year growth was fuelled by record iPhone, iPad and iTune sales.<br><br>Operating margin was 17.2 billion representing 31.6% of revenue. Net income was a record 13.1 billion just ahead of the amount generated in last year\u2019s 14 week quarter and translated to diluted earnings per share of $13.81. Beginning this fiscal year we\u2019re reorganizing the presentation of our results to provide greater transparency. First, we\u2019ve established a new operating segment of Greater China given the very significant contribution of that region to our overall business. We define Greater China to include Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Second, for segment reporting purposes we\u2019re allocating certain manufacturing cost and variances including cost related to product tooling and manufacturing process equipment to our operating segments instead of including these expenditures in corporate expenses as we have done in the past.<br><br>We have recast our operating income for each quarter in fiscal 2011 and 2012 to reflect this change and have provided a reconciliation on Apple.com/Investor. These changes have no impact in overall reported operating income. And third, we have realigned the presentation of product information in our summary data schedule to provide greater visibility to revenue by product category. Under this new format revenue from iPhone, iPad, Mac and iPod sales is presented exclusive of related service and accessory revenue. All revenue from iTunes, stand-alone Apple and third party software and services is presented as a single line item and revenue from all Apple and third party accessory sales is presented as a single line item.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We believe this presentation provides a logical grouping of revenue sources and also provides greater transparency into our results.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">As for the details of this quarter, I'd like to begin with iPhone. We were very pleased to sell 47.8 million iPhones compared to 37 million in the year ago quarter, an increase of over 10 million iPhones.<br><br>This represents a rate of almost 3.7 million iPhones per week in the current year quarter compared to 2.6 million per week in the year ago quarter. That\u2019s an average increase of 39% per week consistent with IDC\u2019s latest published forecast for the global smartphone market in the December quarter.<br><br>And on a sequential basis iPhone sales grew 78% over the September quarter\u2019s results. That\u2019s over 3.5 times IDC\u2019s latest published projection for sequential growth of the overall market resulting in iPhone market share growth. We experienced strong iPhone growth in each of our geographic segments most notably Greater China where iPhone sales more than doubled year-over-year. In the U.S. Kantar Worldpanel Comtech estimates that iPhone shares of smartphones sales increased from 45% in the year ago quarter to over 51% in the current year quarter.<br><br>iPhone sales were driven by the tremendous popularity of iPhone 5 which we\u2019re extremely proud to have launched in 100 countries by the end of December resulting in the fastest iPhone rollout ever. We ended the quarter with about 10.6 million iPhones in channel inventory a sequential increase of about 1.5 million iPhones and ended the quarter within our target range of four to six weeks of iPhone channel inventory on a look forward basis. While other mobile devices and operating systems faced increasing security risks and fragmented inconsistent user experiences, iPhone and iOS continued to deliver an exceptional experience that people love.<br><br>They also provide a secure and trusted eco-system that IT departments require. iPhone continues to be embraced by government agencies and businesses across the globe. Many U.S. government agencies are issuing iPhones by the 1000s as part of their new mobile strategies. Some examples include NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the Transportation Security Administration.<br><br>We are also seeing continued iPhone growth in business across the board from companies replacing existing smartphone deployments to businesses adding first-time smartphone users. Companies around the world like Neiman Marcus, Skanska, and Volvo are issuing iPhones to their employees to improve interactions with customers and give workers access to essential corporate data.<br><br>Turning to iPad, we were thrilled to sell 22.9 million iPads during the quarter compared to 15.4 million in the year ago quarter. That translates to over 1.7 million iPads per week in the current year quarter compared to 1.1 million per week in the year ago quarter, an average increase of 60% per week, ahead of IDC\u2019s latest published estimate of 56% growth for the tablet market. Customers are loving the fourth generation iPad with its faster performance and spectacular Retina display. And the iPad mini has been a tremendous hit offering the full iPad experience in an incredible design that you can hold in one hand.<br><br>In addition to the tremendous response from consumers, iPad continues to be the tablet of choice for businesses and government agencies transforming the way their employees work. Financial institutions like Barclays, Nomura Securities, and Bank of Beijing are deploying iPad to enable employees to better service customers and work securely with financial portfolios and products. In particular, Barclays roll out of over 8000 iPads has generated tremendous employee engagement and feedback making it the most successful IT deployment in Barclays\u2019 history.<br></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">State and local governments in the United States are also rapidly adopting iPad. Court systems, county inspectors, and law enforcement agencies use iPad to streamline processes and replace huge amounts of paper. And state legislatures in Virginia, Texas, and West Virginia are all using iPads to give lawmakers instant access to government documents and information.<br><br>Outside the U.S., 10,000 iPads are being deployed as part of broad adoption of a local government workflow solution in Sweden and over 5,000 iPads have been purchased by the government in the Netherlands for the Dutch Tax Authority and the Dutch Court System. We began and ended the quarter with about 3.4 million iPads in channel inventory. That left us below our target range of four to six weeks of iPad channel inventory on a look-forward basis.<br><br>Turning to Mac, we sold 4.1 million units in the quarter compared to 5.2 million in the year ago quarter. IDC estimates the global personal computer market contracted by 6% during the December quarter. We introduced the new 13-inch MacBook Pro Retina display as well as our stunning new iMacs in October. As we projected a quarter ago, we were significantly constrained with respect to the new iMacs and were only able to ship them for the final month of the December quarter. We believe our Mac sales would have been much higher absent those constraints. We began and ended the quarter with between three and four weeks of Mac channel inventory on a look-forward basis, which is below our target range of four to five weeks.<br><br>Moving to iPod, we sold 12.7 million iPods compared to 15.4 million in the year ago quarter. iPod touch was a popular item in the holiday season and continues to account for over of half of all iPods sold during the December quarter. iPod\u2019s share of U.S. market for MP3 players was over 70% in the December quarter based on the latest data published by MPD and iPod continued to be the top selling MP3 player in most countries we track based on the latest data published by GFK.<br><br>iTunes generated record results with revenue of $2.1 billion in the quarter. We established new all-time quarterly records for revenue from music, from movies, and from apps. We significantly expanded the footprint of our ecosystem during the quarter adding iTunes music stores in 56 countries, including Russia, Turkey, India and South Africa. That brings us to a total of 119 countries, where customers can choose from over 20 million songs to purchase and download.<br><br>The App Store had a record-breaking December quarter with over 2 billion downloads in the month of December alone. The App Store now offers more than 775,000 apps to over 0.5 billion accountholders in 155 countries, including over 300,000 native iPad apps. Cumulative app downloads have now surpassed 40 billion and we\u2019re delighted to have paid our app developers over 7 billion for sales of their incredible work. iPod continues to grow at amazing rate now with 250 million accounts and our customers love our iMessage service sending a staggering 2 billion plus iMessage\u2019s per day.<br><br>I would now like to turn to the Apple retail stores, revenue was in all-time high of over 6.4 billion with growth yield primarily by record iPhone and iPad sales. We opened in total 11 new stores during the quarter including four new stores in Greater China. We excited the quarter with 401 stores, a 150 of which are outside United States. We also relocated or expanded 14 stores that had outgrown their former space during the quarter. With an average of 396 stores opened, average revenue per store was 16.3 million or 1.25 million per store per week compared to 1.22 million per store per week in the year ago quarter. Retail segment income was 1.6 billion.<br><br>We hosted a record 121 million visitors to our stores during the quarter compared to a 110 million in the year ago quarter. That translates to 23,000 visitors per store per week, a 7% increase year-over-year. Total company gross margin was 38.6% which was about 260 basis points higher than our guidance. About half of this difference were driven by lower products and transitory cost that we reflected in our guidance while the remainder resulted from a higher mix of iPhone\u2019s, a weaker U.S. dollar and leverage on the higher revenue.<br><br>Operating expenses were 3.9 billion included 460 million in stock based compensation expense. (Inaudible) was 462 million and the tax rate for the quarter was 26%. Turning to cash, our cash plus short term and long term marketable securities totaled a 137.1 billion at the end of the December quarter compared to a 121 billion at the end of the September quarter, a sequential increase of almost 16 billion.<br><br>The increase in cash was net of 2.5 billion in dividends paid and 2 billion in an upfront payment in conjunction with our accelerated share repurchase program. Over 94 billion of our total cash was offshore at the end of the December quarter. Cash flow from operations was a record 23.4 billion growing by almost 6 billion year-over-year of 33% increase. Our Board of Directors has declared a dividend of $2.55 for common share payable on February 14th, 2013 the shareholders at record as of the close of business on February 11th, 2013.<br><br>As we move ahead into the March quarter I would like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. In addition to the reporting changes that I\u2019ve already mentioned to further increase transparency into our business we\u2019re changing our approach to how we provide guidance. In recent years our guidance reflected a conservative point estimate of results every quarter that we have reasonable confidence in achieving. Going forward we plan to provide a range of guidance that reflects our belief of what we\u2019re likely to achieve.<br></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Well we cannot forecast with complete accuracy we believe we\u2019re likely to report within the range of guidance we provide. Therefore for the March quarter we\u2019re providing revenue guidance of between 41 billion and 43 billion compared to 39.2 billion in the year ago quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 37.5% and 38.5% reflecting approximately 90 million related to stock based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be between 3.8 billion and 3.9 billion including about 480 million related to stock based compensation.<br><br>We expect other income/(expense) to be about $350 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%. In closing we\u2019re thrilled to have generated over 54 billion of revenue in a 13 week period while executing multiple major product transitions. We sold over 75 million iOS devices during the quarter which is a staggering number. We\u2019re producing our best products ever and the execution by our engineering, operations and sales teams to deliver 10s of millions of such innovative, beautifully designed products in such a short time frame is phenomenal. We\u2019re very pleased with our record iPhone and iPad sales, our record music moving and app sales and continued expansion of our robust eco-system. And finally we remain very confident in our new product pipeline.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"> <br>With that, I\u2019d like to open the call to questions.<br><br><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong><br><br>Thank you, Peter. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Operator, may we have the first question, please?<br><br id=\"question-answer-session\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong><br><br><strong>Operator</strong><br><br>(Operator Instructions) And your first question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.<br><br><strong>Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley</strong><br><br>Thanks. Good afternoon. It\u2019s clear that iPhone 5 did incredibly well in the U.S. based on the carryover report to date, but international sell-through data points have been more mixed. How would you characterize trends outside the U.S. for iPhone and are you confident that you have all the right price points and screen sizes to fully capture the non-U.S. demand for iPhone specifically?<br><br><strong>Tim Cook</strong><br><br>Katy, it\u2019s Tim. As Peter said, sequentially we increased over 70% from the September quarter, which was 3.5 times market. And so we could not be happier with that. In terms of the geographic distribution, we saw our highest growth in China and it was into the triple digits, which was higher than the market there. And so, I would characterize it as we are extremely pleased.<br><br><strong>Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley</strong><br><br>And then maybe a question for Peter, with such a large cash generation again this quarter and confidence in the product pipeline, you made those comments in a stock price that is off at highs, why not step up and buyback even more stock than you had originally planned at this point?<br><br><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong><br><br>Sure. Kate, this is something that we continuously assess the opportunities to both invest in the business and return cash. We are pleased to have started our share repurchase program this quarter. And combined with our dividend, we returned about $4.5 billion of cash this quarter and we started the buyback program and expect to return about $45 billion over three years to our shareholders. We do consider increasing these programs and we\u2019ll do what we think is in the best interest of our shareholders.<br><br><strong>Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley</strong><br><br>Thank you.<br><br><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong><br><br>Thanks Katy. Could we have the next question please?<br><br><strong>Operator</strong><br><br>From Goldman Sachs, we\u2019ll hear from Bill Shope.<br><br><strong>Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs</strong><br><br>Okay, great. Thank you. Katy had alluded to this, many of your smartphone competitors are now focusing on differentiating themselves with larger screen sizes than that of the iPhone 5 in your predecessor products. I mean, how do you think about the competitive dynamics for the market right now? In that respect, do you think that\u2019s a valid point of differentiation? And do you think there is a long-term case for a larger screen size or at least the larger variety of screen sizes for iPhones and for the smartphone category in general?<br><br><strong>Tim Cook</strong><br><br>Hi Bill, it\u2019s Tim. The iPhone 5 offers as you know a new 4-inch Retina display, which is the most advanced display in the industry and no one comes close to matching the level of quality as the Retina display. It also provides a larger screen size for iPhone customers without sacrificing the one headed ease-of-use that our customers love. So, we put a lot of thinking into screen size and believe we\u2019ve picked the right one.<br><br><strong>Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs</strong><br><br>I guess, and then shifting on to the question on iPhone demand, obviously you saw healthy growth in the key categories this quarter, but in the context of your guidance, can you give us some color about how you are viewing in-demand trends for the iPhone coming out of the December quarter and how that compares to what you consider to be normal seasonality at this point in the product cycle? And also did you see any meaningful deterioration in iPhone demand at the end of the December quarter or thus far in the March quarter that would lend credence to some near-term conservatism?<br><br><strong>Tim Cook</strong><br><br>Bill, let me take the second half of that and then I will hand it back to Peter for the first half. If you look at the iPhone sales across the quarter, we were very constrained for much of the quarter on iPhone 5. As we began to produce more and ship more sales went up with the production. iPhone 4 was actually in constraint for the entire quarter and sales remained strong, and so that\u2019s helped sales progress across the quarter. I will let Peter talk about the guidance.<br><br><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong><br><br>So, Bill for iPhone, as we told you last year, we built about 2.6 million units of channel inventory in the March quarter, which allowed us at that time to get into our four to six-week inventory target. So, the underlying sell-through was about 32.5 million and we would expect sell-through growth year-over-year as it has for \u2013 in the quarter as it has for many quarters in a row.<br><br><strong>Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs</strong><br><br>Okay, thank you.<br><br><strong>Tim Cook</strong><br><br>But Bill, let me make one additional point on this, I know there has been lots of rumors about order cuts and so forth and so let me just take a moment to make a comment on these, I don\u2019t want to comment on any particular rumor because I would spend my life doing that but I would suggest it's good to question the accuracy of any kind of rumor about build plans and also stress that even if a particular data point were factual it would be impossible to accurately interpret the data point as to what it meant for our overall business because the supply chain is very complex and we obviously have multiple sources for things, yields might vary, supply performance can vary. The beginning inventory positions can vary, I mean there is just an inordinate long list of things that would make any single data point not a great proxy for what\u2019s going on.<br><br><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong><br><br>Thanks Phil. Can we have the next question please?<br><br><strong>Operator</strong><br><br>From Sanford Bernstein, we\u2019ll go to Toni Sacconaghi.<br><br><strong>Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein</strong><br><br>I just wanted to make sure that I fully understand your comments about a guidance in the new guidance range that you\u2019re providing. Are you effectively saying that when you provided guidance before it was uniquely conservative and that level of conservatism no longer exists? We\u2019re actually getting the real planning range for Apple and that this is fundamentally different from how you approached and provided guidance.<br><br><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong><br><br>Tony it's Peter. In the past we\u2019ve provided a single point estimate of guidance, it was conservative then we had reasonable confidence in achieving. This quarter and going forward we\u2019re going to provide a range of guidance that we believe that we\u2019re likely to report within, no guarantees, forecasting is difficult but we believe that we will report within that range.<br><br><strong>Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein</strong><br><br>I\u2019m just comparing the word, so you think you\u2019ll report in the range before you - I think on average eclipsed your guidance by on EPS by 35%, was the guidance before something that you felt reasonably confident in achieving or was there an implicit buffer in there because I\u2019m trying to reconcile the fact that you said you thought it was reasonable before but your historical precedent was, you eclipsed it enormously on an ongoing basis and this time you\u2019re saying there is a high likelihood of falling within the range and I want to understand the distinction.<br><br><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong><br><br>I will go through it again, in the past we gave you a single point estimate of guidance, it was conservative that we had reasonable confidence as you can have that we would achieve. We\u2019re now providing you a range of guidance that we expect to as best we can report within.<br><br><strong>Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein</strong><br><br>Okay and then if I could follow-up Tim you started up the call talking about Apple\u2019s philosophy of really ensuring that you satisfy your customers and making great products. Against that backdrop how important is market share preservation. This quarter you held share maybe increased it fractionally on a year-over-year basis in the global smartphone market but clearly you had an exciting new product. Is holding share in the smartphone market in 2013 a priority for Apple, yes or no and why? And realistically how does Apple hold share given that the market segment and price point that you play in is expected to grow a lot slower and you have pretty dominant share in that high end.<br><br><strong>Tim Cook</strong><br><br>Toni the most important thing to Apple is to make the best products in the world that enrich customer\u2019s lives. That\u2019s our high order bit; that means that we aren\u2019t interested revenue for revenue sake, we could put the Apple brand in lot of things and sell lot more stuff but that\u2019s not what we\u2019re here for. We want to make only the best products and so what does that mean for market share? We\u2019ve been able to do that and I think we\u2019ve had a great track record here on iPod doing different products at different price points and getting a reasonable share from doing that. And so one doesn\u2019t, I wouldn\u2019t view these things as mutually exclusive as some might, but the high order bit is making a great product, that enriches customer\u2019s lives. And so that\u2019s what we are focused on.<br><br><strong>Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein</strong><br><br>Thank you.<br><br><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong><br><br>Thanks Tony. Could we have the next question please?<br></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Operator</strong><br><br>From Barclays, we\u2019ll go to Ben Reitzes.<br><br><strong>Ben Reitzes - Barclays</strong><br><br>Yeah, thanks a lot. First question is with regard to Macs, could you talk a little bit more about what happened and it would seem that the shortfall there is well over $1 billion in the quarter or maybe even as much as a $1.5 billion and how much of that was pushed into the March quarter within that new March guidance? Thanks.<br><br><strong>Tim Cook</strong><br><br>Yeah, Ben, it\u2019s Tim. Thanks for asking that question. I wanted to talk about this, as if you look at the previous year, our Mac sales were about $5.2 million. This year, they were $4.1 million and so the difference is $1.1 million. And so let me try to bridge that. iMacs were down by 700,000 units year-over-year. As you remember, we announced the new iMacs late in October and when we announced those, we announced that they would ship, the first one, the 21.5-inch would ship in November and we did ship it at the end of November, we announced that the 27-inch would ship in December and we did ship that in mid-December. And so there were limited weeks of ramping on these products during the quarter, we left the quarter with significant constraints on the iMac. And we believe we know that our sales would have been materially higher if those constraints would not have exist. We tried to tell people this on the conference call in October, I think I said that we would have significant constraints on iMacs, but I recognized to some folks this maybe to surprise.<br><br>Number two, if you look at last year, as Peter went through in his opening comments we had 14 weeks in the quarter. We have 13 weeks in the quarter this year. Last year, in the average week, we sold 370,000 Macs. The third part of the bridge here would be that our channel inventory was down from the beginning of the quarter by over 100,000 units. And that\u2019s because obviously we didn\u2019t have the iMacs channel inventory was in significant constraint. So, if you just take these three factors, they bridge more than the difference of between this year sales and last year sales.<br><br>Now, in addition to these three points, I would point out two other things, and these are lesser things than these other than the total of these other three obviously. One, the market for PCs is weak. IDC\u2019s last estimate I believe was around negative 6%. Two, we sold 23 million iPads and we obviously could have sold more than this, because we could not build enough iPad minis to come into a demand balance. And so there was \u2013 we have always said there is some cannibalization there. I am sure there was some cannibalization of Macs there, but the three large factors of it, the aggregated totals of three large, the iMac, the difference in seven days of the previous year having seven extra days and the channel inventory, I think more than explains the difference between this year and the previous year. As a side note, if you looked at our portables alone, they were in line with IDC\u2019s projections of market growth.<br><br><strong>Ben Reitzes - Barclays</strong><br><br>Okay, thanks a lot Tim. And then just my follow-up is with regard to web services, online services, there has been a lot of publicity around maps and can you give us an update there? And then looking forward how does the year look in terms of innovation, in terms of iOS 7 and your online and web services, how will that drive Apple?<br><br><strong>Tim Cook</strong><br><br>Well, let me start with the second part of this. We are working on some incredible stuff. The pipeline is chock-full, I don\u2019t want to comment about a specific product, but we feel great about what we have got in store. In terms of Maps, we have made a number of improvements to Maps since the introduction of iOS 6 back in September and will roll out even more improvements across the rest of the year and we are going to keep working on this as I have said before until it lives up to our incredibly high standards. Users can already see many of these improvements because they include things like improved satellite and improved imaginary and improved categorization, improved local information for 1000s of businesses and so forth. The usage in maps is significantly higher than it was prior to iOS 6. In terms of other services we feel fantastic about how we\u2019re doing, in notification center we\u2019ve sent over 4 trillion notifications and this is mind blowing. As Peter mentioned in his opening comment for iMessage we\u2019ve sent over 450 billion and are currently sending those 6 billion per day. We\u2019ve gained center, we have got over 200 million registered users, we\u2019ve 800,000 apps on the App Store with over 40 billion downloads and so I feel really, really great about it, there is obviously more stuff we can do and you can bet we\u2019re thinking about all of it.<br><br><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong><br><br>Can we have the next question please?<br><br><strong>Operator</strong><br><br>And next we\u2019ll to Steve Milunovich with UBS.<br><br><strong>Steve Milunovich \u2013 UBS</strong><br><br>Could you review your comments about gross margin in the quarter and also looking ahead perhaps commenting on a few areas first of all where you\u2019re on your product cost curve, where you expected to be and then also any comments on mix within the iPhone line in terms of 5 versus 4s, amount of storage and then also on the iPad. The last quarter you said you really didn\u2019t know what the proportion of minis would be, can you make any comments in terms of the demand for mini relative to what you expected?<br><br><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong><br><br>Sure Steve, it's Peter I\u2019ll start, I\u2019ll make a comment on mini gross margin and maybe Tim can pick up on some of your iPhone questions. With the iPad mini it's hard to know, we could not make enough in the quarter. We were constrained every week. Customers love the mini and we wish that we could have made more and we ended the quarter with significant backlog. For the gross margin in the December quarter we were about 260 basis points ahead of our guidance, about half this difference was driven by lower product in transitory cost and we had reflected in our guidance and the rest came from a higher mix of iPhone\u2019s, a weaker dollar and leverage on the higher revenue.<br><br>As we look forward we think the gross margin will be somewhere between about 10 basis points and a 110 basis points lower sequentially. We believe that there are two primary factors that will benefit gross margins sequentially, first being the largest of the two. Our teams have made meaningful progress in reductions in product and transitory cost from the actions that they have been working on to get down to the cost curve. So we expect the benefit in the March quarter beyond what we saw in the December quarter and second we expect a more typical level of deferred revenue from device sales. We expect these factors to be more than offset by 10 to a 120 basis points by the loss of leverage coming out of the December quarter which is very typical for us and a different mix of our current products.<br><br>And regarding mix as an example as we indicated last quarter the iPad mini gross margin is significantly below the corporate average and we expect to be able to meet demand for this product in the March quarter which again we could not in the December quarter.<br><br><strong>Tim Cook</strong><br><br>Steve I will make some comments on mix, if you look, your question on iPhone mix I will bring up three points, one the ASP for iPhone was essentially the same year-over-year in the quarter that we just finished. Underneath that if you looked at the mix of iPhone 5 to total iPhone and in the previous year you look at 4s to total iPhone to the iPhone those mixes are similar and then thirdly I think you asked about capacities, in Q1 we saw similar results as we saw in Q1 at the previous year. So does that answer your question on mix?<br><br><strong>Steve Milunovich - UBS</strong><br><br>Yes it does. Thank you. And then second question would be on CapEx, you spent almost as much Intel does. I think you guys have said you\u2019re not going to become vertically integrated per se but in a sense you\u2019re since that as soon I buy an equipment for your partners, could you talk about the strategy here and how much of a differentiator this gives Apple in terms of your ability to ramp new products over time? And maybe a little bit more about how deep you will go in terms of semiconductor components for you, etcetera?<br><br><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong><br><br>Sure. Steve it\u2019s Peter. We expect to spend about $10 billion in CapEx this fiscal year that will be up little under $2 billion year-over-year. We expect to spend a little bit under $1 billion in the retail stores. And the other $9 billion is spent in a variety of areas. We are buying equipment that we will own that we will put in partners\u2019 facilities. Our primary motivation there is for supply, but we get other benefits as well. We are also adding to our datacenter capabilities to support all the services that Tim spoke about in answering Ben\u2019s question and in facilities and in infrastructure. So, that\u2019s where the capital is going.<br><br><strong>Steve Milunovich - UBS</strong><br><br>Thank you.<br><br><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong><br><br>Thanks Steve. Can we have the next question please?<br><br><strong>Operator</strong><br><br>From Cross Research Group, we\u2019ll hear from Shannon Cross.<br><br><strong>Shannon Cross - Cross Research Group</strong><br><br>Thank you very much. Tim, can you talk a bit about what happened last year in terms of the refresh cycle where you had about 80% of your revenue refresh in the last few months? And then how you are thinking about it this year, I mean, I know you say you shipped products and they are ready, but I mean is this a situation where you are going to try to stagger it out a little bit this year or will it be sort of a similar situation to 2012?<br><br><strong>Tim Cook</strong><br><br>The question I want to answer Shannon, but the 80% was a unusually high percentage for us. I don\u2019t know exactly what the historic numbers on that, but I can tell you that the number of ramps were unprecedented in the fact that we had new products in every category is something we have not done before. We feel great to have delivered so many products for the holiday season though and our customers have certainly expressed joy over it.<br><br><strong>Shannon Cross - Cross Research Group</strong><br><br>Okay. And then I guess can you talk a bit more about China, you provided which is where you\u2019ve broken out the Greater China revenue, but can you talk about what you are hearing from customers and from some of your partners there, your thoughts on retail distribution and expansion and just sort of overall, what you are seeing over, what you saw for the holiday period, and then what you sort of expect from China going forward?<br><br><strong>Tim Cook</strong><br><br>Yeah. If you look at our total China, total Greater China, which would include our retail stores that are in China. Our revenues were $7.3 billion in the quarter. So, this is incredibly high, it\u2019s up over 60% year-on-year. And again, that\u2019s comparing 13 to 14 weeks and so it\u2019s really the underlying growth, it\u2019s higher than that. We saw exceptional growth in iPhones into the triple digits. iPad, we shipped iPad very late in the quarter in December, and despite that, saw very nice growth. We are expanding in Apple retail there. In the year ago quarter, we had 6 stores we now have 11. We obviously have many more to open there. In our premium resellers, we went over 400, up from a little over 200 in the previous year. And we increased iPhone point of sales from 7,000 to over 17,000 there. And now this isn\u2019t nearly what we need and it\u2019s not the final by any means, we are not even close to that, but we are making, I feel that we are making great progress that was just over there recently. And I was talking to a lot of different people and I am very happy with how things are going.<br><br><strong>Shannon Cross - Cross Research Group</strong><br><br>Thank you.<br><br><strong>Tim Cook</strong><br><br>It\u2019s clear that China it\u2019s already our second largest region as you can see from the data that we have given you and it\u2019s clear, there is a lot of potential there.<br><br><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong><br><br>Thanks Shannon. Can we have the next question please?<br><br><strong>Operator</strong><br><br>Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray<br><br><strong>Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray</strong><br></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Hey good afternoon. Tim, you made comments in the past that the Apple TV experience is dated and Apple wants to fix that problem, if we can take a step outside of the form factor debate whether it\u2019s a box or can you just talk in high level how important this market is to Apple, number one? And number two is can you accomplish what you ultimately want to accomplish with the reality of where content is today, and how content is distributed?<br><br><strong>Tim Cook</strong><br><br>Gene you\u2019re asking me all questions I don\u2019t want to answer but let me see if I can find some comments to make that productive. In terms of the product that we sell today, the Apple TV we sold more last quarter than we\u2019ve ever sold before, eclipsing 2 million during the quarter. It was up almost 60% year-on-year and so there is actually very, very good growth in that product and what was the small niche at one time the people that loved it is a much larger number some of it, I have said in the past this is an area of intense interest for us and it remains that and I tend to believe that the, there is a lot we can contribute in this space and so we continue to pull the string and see where it leads us but I don\u2019t want to be more specific.<br><br><strong>Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray</strong><br><br>Okay and just a house-keeping for Peter, Peter you gave gross margin guidance this quarter but no EPS guidance, is there anything, any moving parts between the gross margin and the operating line that we should be aware of that might have (inaudible) that nuance and how you\u2019re giving guidance?<br><br><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong><br><br>No Gene, the our prior method of providing guidance was a point estimate for each line item of the P&amp;L including EPS and our guidance for the March quarter and how we\u2019ll give guidance in the future, we\u2019re going to give a range for revenue, for gross margin and for OpEx and therefore there are many possibilities for EPS within the range that will leave you to think through and we\u2019ll report our actual results for March and April.<br><br><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong><br><br>Thanks Gene. Can we\u2019ve the next question please?<br><br><strong>Operator</strong><br><br>From Bank of Montreal we\u2019ll go to Keith Bachman.<br><br><strong>Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal</strong><br><br>The first one is Tim could you talk a little bit about the data even as anecdotal on what, how iPhone sales proceeded in terms of new customers versus upgrades and how that compared to say if you go to the 4s last year.<br><br><strong>Tim Cook</strong><br><br>I don\u2019t have those specific numbers in front of me but the iPhone 5 obviously with the numbers that we\u2019re selling, we\u2019re selling to a lot of new customers.<br><br><strong>Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal</strong><br><br>Because we had heard feedback that there was a lot more of an upgrade cycle to existing customers but it sounds like that\u2019s not a statement that you would agree with.<br><br><strong>Tim Cook</strong><br><br>I don\u2019t know who you were talking to and so again this is one of those things you I would caution on using as a proxy for the world. There are many carriers created differently.<br><br><strong>Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal</strong><br><br>Well let me turn to my next question. Then Peter as we think about the March quarter I\u2019m a bit confused how to think about iPad\u2019s and you mentioned that iPad mini was constrained, any kind of comments on what seasonality would be and more importantly how are thinking about the aggregate amount of inventory that\u2019s in the channel for iPad\u2019s will that amount increase, decrease or stay the same as we reflect on how to model units in the March quarter.<br><br><strong>Tim Cook</strong><br><br>Keith it's Tim and I\u2019m going to couple of comments, iPad mini was very constrained. We ended with underneath our target channel inventory rank which Peter has commented earlier. We believe that we can achieve supply demand balance on iPad mini later this quarter that was likely mean that we would need more units in the channel than we have today I think that would be a fair conclusion to draw.<br><br><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong><br><br>Keith I\u2019ll add to that you know for total iPad sales we\u2019re not going to, we don\u2019t provide a sublevel forecast but we would expect a large year-over-year increase in iPad sales but a post-holiday sequential decline for iPad sales which I think is typical and as Tim said we expect to be able to meet demand for the mini.<br><br><strong>Tim Cook</strong><br><br>Keith it's probably worth pointing out just to be totally clear for the last quarter we had strong sales of iPad and iPad mini.<br><br><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong><br><br>Thank you. Can we have the next question please?<br><br><strong>Operator</strong><br><br>We\u2019ll go to Scott Craig with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"> </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Scott Craig - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"> </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Thanks. Good afternoon. Hey, Tim can you maybe discuss the tablet market a little bit in relation to Macs and other PCs is sort of how you are thinking about the cannibalization of that market for the iPad relative to the PC market? And then secondly, typically each quarter, you sort of talk about some of the component constraints and you certainly talked about iPhone 4 being constrained and the iPad mini is better, so as you enter into the quarter where do you see the challenges for meeting demand for the calendar first quarter? Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"> </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"> </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Sure. Let me take the second part of that first. I think overall our team did just a fantastic job ramping a record number of new products during the quarter. We did have significant shortages due to robust demand on both iPad mini and both models of the iMac that persisted the entire quarter. And we are still short of both of those today as the matter of fact. Additionally, supply of iPhone 5 which short to demand until late in the quarter and iPhone 4 was short for the entire quarter, we believe that we can achieve a supply demand balance on iPad mini during this quarter and on iPhone 4 during this quarter. On iMac, we are confident that we are going to significantly increase the supply, but the demand here is very strong and we are not certain that we will achieve a supply demand balance during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"> </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">In terms of cannibalization and how we think about this, I see cannibalization as a huge opportunity for us. One, our base philosophy is to never fear cannibalization. If we do, somebody else will just cannibalize it and so we never fear it. We know that iPhone has cannibalized some iPod business. It doesn\u2019t worry us, but it\u2019s done that. We know that iPad will cannibalize some Macs that doesn\u2019t worry us. On iPad in particular, we have the mother of all opportunities here, because the Windows market is much, much larger than the Mac market is. And I think it is clear that it is clear that it\u2019s already cannibalizing some and I think there is a tremendous amount more opportunity there. And as you know, I have said for two or three, actually three years now I believe that I believe the tablet market will be larger than the PC market at some point. And I still believe that. And you can see by the growth in tablets and the pressure on PCs that those lines are beginning to converge.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"> </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And I think the other thing for us maybe not for others, but for us is if somebody will buys an iPad mini or an iPad and it\u2019s their first Apple product, we had great experience through the years of knowing that when somebody buys their first Apple product that a percentage of these people windup buying another type of Apple product. And so if you remember what we had termed the halo effect for some time with the iPod, with the Mac, we are very confident that, that will happen and we are seeing some evidence of that on the iPad as well. And so I see cannibalization as a huge opportunity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"> </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"> </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Thank you, Scott. Can we have the next question please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"> </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"> </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And we will go to Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"> </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Mark Moskowitz - JPMorgan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"> </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Yes, thanks. Good afternoon. Question Tim around the iPhone, Peter gave some transparency around the qualitative sequential and year-over-year potential increases in the iPad for the March quarter. How should we think about the iPhone family against that in terms of year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter potential increases or decreases, and are there any sort of dynamics around slower pace of LTE rollouts by the network carriers having an impact?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"> </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"> </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">The thing to consider on iPhone market is that in the year ago quarter, we have built 2.6 million units of channel inventory, because we did the \u2013 one reason was that we did the launch in the March quarter instead of in the previous quarter. And so the underlying sales growth from the year ago quarter was 32.5, the sell-in was 35 as you can probably see on a sheet in front of you. And so in thinking through, the number of iPhones to predict we looked at the 32.5 number We believe we'll grow year over year, but don't want to be more specific than that. We guide in the aggregate instead of the product level.<br><br><strong>Mark Moskowitz - JPMorgan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><br>And the pace of LTE rollout around the world, has slower rollout had impact on iPhone sales philosophy? Could that change?<br><br><strong>Tim Cook</strong><br><br>Today we have 24 carriers on LTE around the world for iPHone 5. Those are in countries like the US, Korea, UK, Germany, Canada, Japan and Australia and a few others. Next week, we are adding 36 more carriers for LTE support. And these carriers will be in countries that were currently not supporting LTE, so the LTE coverage now as of next week in Italy, Denmark, Finland, Switzerland, Philippines, also several Middle Eastern countries. And so if you look at the total of all of these and the incremental subscribers that are in those countries, that\u2019s over 300 million. And so that\u2019s the next range of LTE rollouts that I am pleased to tell you about today. Also as you know, iPhone 5 also supports other ultra-fast networks HSPA+ and with downloads up to 42Mbps.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"> </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Mark Moskowitz - JPMorgan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"> </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"> </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"> </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thanks Mark. Can we have the next question please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"> </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"> </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">From Deutsche Bank we\u2019ll go to Chris Whitmore.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"> </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"> </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thanks. Just a follow-up on the iPhone question with respect to the guidance, just, assuming there is some benefit from the Mac carryover effect and iPad release etcetera, and adjusting for the inventory, it seems you are guiding to kind of mid to high single-digit year-on-year unit growth for the iPhone business from a sell-through standpoint. Is that the right ballpark we should be thinking about and why the big deceleration from the 25% plus kind of weekly sales rate you quoted in your intro comments?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"> </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"> </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Sure, Chris, it\u2019s Peter. We are not going to talk about guidance at a specific product level, but let me give you some things we thought about in coming up with the range of $41 billion to $43 billion. It is that range is a 5% to 10% year-over-year increase. And there are few factors that are impacting the year-over-year results making the strong performance of the business a little bit harder to see. So, let me point a few of these out. First of all, as we have talked about several times on the call, last year in the March quarter, we\u2019ve built 2.6 million units of iPhone channel inventory, which allowed us to get into our 4 to 6-week range. That increased the revenue in the year ago quarter by $1.6 billion. And as Tim talked about that was sell-in that was not sell-through, we are thinking about the business on a sell-through basis. So, don\u2019t lose sight of the 1.6 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"> </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Second, the iPhone 5 rollout this year, has been our fastest ever. We are selling in 100 countries by the end of December. Last year, we did not achieve this country distribution until the March quarter, which included China that we launched in January. Third, we made a very good strategic decision to introduce the iPad mini which customers love and to keep the price reduced iPad 2 in the line. As a result of this, we saw a reduction in our iPad ASPs of about $101 year-over-year in the December quarter. And you can see that, our iPad units grew faster than our iPad revenue in the December quarter. We would expect iPad ASPs to be down quite a bit in the March quarter on a year-over-year basis for the same reasons.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"> </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And then finally, the PC market grew 4% last year in the March quarter, and this year IDC is projecting that to decline by 3%. So, considering these factors, the underlying performance of the business is much stronger than the 5% to 10% year-over-year growth implies and we remain very confident in our business and our new product pipeline.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"> </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"> </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And for my follow-up I wanted to come back to something Tim said earlier about that you are not fearing cannibalization; I wanted to ask in context of your iPhone business given the strength you are seeing at the low end of your product line the iPhone 4 being stocked out during the quarter. There seems to be a lot of demand at lower price points for the iPhone, why not get more aggressive at lower price bands and move down market in the iPhone business? Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"> </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"> </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I am not going to go into our pricing strategy, but we feel great about the opportunity of getting products to customers and a percentage of those buying other Apple products. And that we have obviously seen evidence of that through history and continue to see evidence of that today.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong><br><br>Thank you Chris.

We have a lot of news to share with you today about the details of our March quarter as well as a significant increase to our capital return program.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">First, I would like to talk about our business and the road ahead. We are now half way through our fiscal 2013, and we\u2019ve accomplished a tremendous amount. We\u2019ve introduced and ramped production of an unprecedented number of new products, and we\u2019ve set many new sales records. Our revenue for the first half was over $98 billion and our net income was over $22 billion. During that time, we sold 85 million iPhones and 42 million iPads. These are very, very large numbers, unimaginable even to us just a few years ago.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Despite producing results that met or beat our guidance as we have done consistently, we know they  didn't meet everyone's expectations, and though we\u2019ve achieved incredible scale and financial success, we acknowledge that our growth rate has slowed and our margins have decreased from the exceptionally high level we experienced in 2012.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Our revenues grew about $13 billion in the first half of this fiscal year. Even though that\u2019s like adding the total first half revenue of five Fortune 500 companies, our average weekly growth slowed to 19% and our gross margins are closer to the levels of a few years ago. Our fiscal 2012 results were incredibly strong and that\u2019s making comparison very difficult this year. Last year, our business benefited from both high growth and demand for products and a corresponding growth in channel inventories along with a richer<strong> </strong>mix of higher gross margin products, a more favorable foreign currency environment, and historically low costs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">These compares are made further challenging until we anniversary the launch of the iPad mini, which as you know, we strategically priced at a lower margin. As Peter will discuss, we are guiding to flat revenues year over year for the June quarter along with a slight sequential decline in gross margins.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">The decline in Apple\u2019s stock price over the last couple of quarters has been very frustrating to all of us. But Apple remains very strong and we will continue to do what we do best. We can\u2019t control items such as exchange rates and world economies and even certain cost pressures, but the most important objective for Apple will always be creating innovative products and that is directly within our control.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We will continue to focus on the long-term, and we remain very optimistic about our future. We are participating on large and growing markets. We see great opportunities in front of us, particularly given the long-term prospects of the smartphone and tablet market, the strength of our incredible ecosystem, which we plan to continue to augment with new services, our plans for expanded distribution, and the potential of exciting new product categories.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Take the smartphone market for example, IDC estimates that this market will double between 2012 and 2016 to an incredible 1.4 billion units annually, and Gartner estimates that the tablet market is growing at an even faster rate from 125 million units in 2012 to a projected 375 million by 2016.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Our teams are hard at work on some amazing new hardware, software, and services that we can\u2019t wait to introduce this fall and throughout 2014. We continue to be very confident in our future product plans.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Apple has many distinct and unique advantages as the only company in the industry with world-class skills in hardware, software, and services. We have the strongest ecosystem in the industry with App Stores in 155 countries, iTunes music stores in 119 countries, hundreds of millions of iCloud users around the world, and most importantly, the highest loyalty and customer satisfaction rates in the business. And of course, we have a tremendous culture of innovation with a relentless focus on making the world\u2019s best products that change people\u2019s lives. This is the same culture and company that brought the world the iPhone and the iPad, and we\u2019ve got a lot more surprises in the works.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">A little over a year ago, we announced a plan to return $45 billion to shareholders over three years. Since we began paying dividends last August and began share buybacks last October, we\u2019ve already returned $10 billion under that program. We continue to generate cash in excess of our needs to operate the business, invest in our future, and maintain flexibility to take advantage of strategic opportunities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We remain firmly committed to our objective of delivering attractive returns to shareholders through both our business performance and return of capital. So today, we are announcing an aggressive plan that more than doubles the size of the capital return program we announced last year to a total of $100 billion by the end of calendar year 2015. The vast majority of our incremental cash return will be in the form of share repurchases. As the Board and management team deliberated among the various alternatives to returning cash, we concluded that investing in Apple was the best.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In addition to the share repurchases, we are increasing our current dividend by 15% to further appeal to investors seeking yield. And as part of our updated program, we will access the debt markets. Peter will provide more details about all of this in a moment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We appreciate the input that so many of our shareholders have provided us on how best to deploy our cash. We will review our cash allocation strategy each year, and we will continue to invest confidently in the business to bring great new products to market, strategically deploy capital in our supply chain, our retail stores and our infrastructure, and make acquisitions to expand our capabilities. We will be disciplined in what we do, but we will not underinvest.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Peter to discuss the details of the March quarter. Peter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Thank you, Tim. We are pleased to report the results of our second fiscal quarter. We established new March quarter records for iPhone and iPad sales and new all-time record for iTunes sales, leading to Apple\u2019s strongest March quarter revenue ever.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Revenue for the quarter was $43.6 billion compared to $39.2 billion in the year ago quarter, an increase of $4.4 billion or 11% and $600 million over the high end of our guidance range. The year-over-year revenue increase was fueled primarily by strong growth in iPad and iTunes sales as well as continued strong revenue from iPhone and Mac.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Operating margin was $12.6 billion, representing 28.8% of revenue. Net income was $9.5 billion translating to diluted earnings per share of $10.09. As for the details of the quarter, I\u2019d like to begin with iPhone. We sold 37.4 million iPhones compared to 35.1 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of over 2.3 million or 7%. We ended the quarter with about 11.6 million total iPhones in channel inventory, a sequential increase of about 1 million iPhones and we ended the quarter within our target range of four to six weeks of iPhone channel inventory.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Based on research published earlier this month by comScore, iPhones garnered the number one spot in the U.S. smartphone market for the three-month period ended in February with 39% share, up from 35% in the previous survey period. And in Japan, IDC Japan announced that iPhone gained the number one position for all of calendar year 2012 as well as for calendar Q4 2012 in both handsets and smartphones. This is also the first time a non-Japanese company has achieved the number one spot for an entire year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In addition, Apple was ranked number one in Nikkei\u2019s 2013 Japan Brand Survey, achieving the top spot for the second year in a row, which is unprecedented for a non-Japanese company. Around the world, based on its latest published estimates, IDC ranked iPhone number one or two in smarphone sales in over half the countries IDC tracks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">A recent study by Kantar measured 95% loyalty rate among iPhone owners, substantially higher than the competition, and iPhone remains top in customer experience. Last month, we were very pleased to receive the number one ranking in smartphone customer satisfaction from J.D. Power and Associates for the ninth consecutive time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Businesses around the world continue to scale iPhone across their workforces. Globally, nearly 30,000 companies are developing and distributing iOS apps for corporate use by their employees.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Cisco\u2019s Bring Your Own Device program across 80 countries has resulted in a 50% increase in the number of iPhones connecting to its corporate network in the past year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">GlaxoSmithKline has developed more than 50 in-house iOS apps to support the thousands of iPhones and iPads connecting to its corporate network. Other companies such as AXA, Nordstrom\u2019s, Eaton  Corporation, and Takeda Pharmaceuticals are supporting thousands of iPhones, and are continually adding new in-house apps to better serve customers and help employees work more efficiently.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to iPad, we were thrilled to sell 19.5 million iPads during the quarter compared to 11.8 million in the year ago quarter, that\u2019s an increase of 7.7 million units or 65%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">iPad experienced very strong year-over-year growth in every operating segment, particularly in Greater China and Japan where sales more than doubled year over year. Both iPad and iPad mini continue to be extremely popular, and we were pleased with sales of both.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We were able to sell significantly more iPad minis in the March quarter than in the December launch quarter and to expand availability to China. Customers love the combination of experience, performance, and size that iPad mini offers, and our early market research indicates that the overwhelming majority of iPad mini purchasers are first-time iPad customers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We ended the quarter with about 4.8 million iPads in channel inventory, a sequential increase of about 1.4 million. All of the sequential increase was attributable to iPad mini. As we discussed previously, we were not able to meet demand for iPad mini in the December quarter and entered the March quarter below our target range of channel inventory. This sequential increase places us within our target range of four to six weeks of total iPad channel inventory.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">The most recent survey published by ChangeWave indicated a 96% satisfaction rate among iPad customers. Not only is iPad a huge hit among consumers, but it also continues to be widely adopted by business customers as well. iPad and the iOS ecosystem are driving innovation across industries and in companies large and small.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We are delighted by the number of companies that are choosing iPad for their most important business tasks as well as the rapid adoption of iPad in emerging countries around the world. Doctors at the Columbia Cardiovascular Foundation in South America are using an in-house app to perform remote diagnostics for patients in inaccessible parts of the country.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">First National Bank, the oldest bank in South Africa has issued iPads to wealth managers to help enhance customer relationships and interactions. And in the education market, Grupo Santillana has developed UNO Internacional and integrated educational system that uses iPads to create digital learning environment in more than 700 private K-12 schools in Latin America. UNO Internacionalhas deployed more than 60,000 iPads to schools in Mexico, Colombia, and Brazil including 17,000 iPads for teachers and students in Brazil in the March quarter alone.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to Mac, we sold just under 4 million Macs, which is a 2% decline from the year-ago quarter. IDC estimates that the global personal computer market contracted by 14% during the March quarter. We experienced strong year-over-year growth in desktop sales following the December quarter launch of our stunning new iMacs, offset by a decline in portable sales given a weaker personal computer market overall. We ended the quarter within our four to five-week target range in Mac channel inventory.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Moving to iPod, we sold 5.6 million iPods compared to 7.7 million in the year ago quarter. iPod Touch continued to account for over half of all iPods sold during the March quarter. iPod\u2019s share of U.S. market for MP3 players was over 70% in the March quarter based on the latest data published by NPD, and iPod continues to be the top-selling MP3 player in most countries we track based on the latest data published by GfK.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">The Apple ecosystem continues to grow and thrive and we believe it\u2019s a very important driver of our incredibly strong customer satisfaction and retention, as well as developer interest and success. This Sunday marks the 10th anniversary of the introduction of the iTunes Music Store, which revolutionized the distribution of digital content.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Today, our iTunes store offer the broadest combination of geographic reach in content depth in the industry, and they surpassed quarterly billings of $4 billion for the first time ever in the March quarter, that\u2019s a $16 billion annual run rate making our digital content stores the largest in the world. The quarter\u2019s iTunes billings translated to record quarterly iTunes revenue of $2.4 billion, up 28% from the year ago March quarter with new quarterly revenue records for music, movies, and apps.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">The strong iTunes sales in addition to other service revenue helped us achieve for the first time more than $4 billion in combined quarterly revenue from iTunes, software, and services. We are thrilled with the growth of these revenue streams. Today, we have music stores in 119 countries offering a combined catalog of 35 million songs. We sell movies in 109 countries offering 60,000 titles, and we have iBookstores in 155 countries offering 1.75 million iBooks for sale, and with App Stores in 155 countries that encompass almost 90% of the world\u2019s population, our developers have created more than 850,000 iOS apps, including 350,000 apps made for iPad.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Cumulative app downloads have surpassed 45 billion and app developers have made over $9 billion for their sales through the App Store, including $4.5 billion in the most recent four quarters alone. Canalys estimate the sales from our App Store accounted for 74% of all app sales worldwide in the March quarter. We believe this is in large part due to the great development environment, broad distribution, large and active user base, and seamless integration that the iOS platform offers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Developer such as Backflip Studios have seen explosive growth in their business, thanks to the success of their apps on the iOS platform. With 70 people, this company maintains a growing suite of titles that has seen over 275 million downloads equating  to nearly 5 million daily active users and 34 million monthly active users. With annual App Store sales approaching $100 million, Backflip\u2019s iOS sales comprised approximately 95% of the company\u2019s revenues in 2012.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Another tremendous success story is Supercell, founded in 2010. Based in Finland, Supercell\u2019s Hey Day and Clash of Clans titles available only on iOS have been the top most in iPad games in over 60 countries helping the company generate $8.5 million in revenue per employee in 2012. And in the enterprise, iOS devices have a strong lead over Android. In its most recently published quarterly enterprise device activations report, Good Technologies found iOS devices accounted for 77% of all activations by its corporate customers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">And thanks to careful App Store curation for the quality of apps, the iOS platform offers a much more secure environment. Recent research by McAfee Labs found that 97% of identified mobile malware was on the Android platform, with the remainder primarily on the Symbian and Java ME platforms. But perhaps the most important measure of the success of our ecosystem is how engaged our customers are with our products and services.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">In its most recently published update, Chitika<strong> </strong>found that iPad accounted for 82% of all North American Tablet Web Traffic in March. Interest in apps remained very strong in the March quarter with over 800 apps downloaded per second and year-over-year iOS app revenues more than doubling in the quarter. And since launching iCloud just 18 months ago, we now have 300 million people using it every day. We will continue to invest in the ecosystem and have some great new features and capabilities in the pipeline.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">I\u2019d now like to turn to the Apple Retail Stores. Revenue for the quarter was $5.2 billion compared to $4.4 billion in the year ago quarter, an increase of 19%. This growth was fueled  primarily by strong sales of iPhone and iPad. We ended the quarter with a total of 402 stores, including a 151 outside the United States. We expect to open about 30 new stores in total in fiscal 2013 and to complete at least 20 store remodels. With an average of 401 stores open in the March quarter, average revenue per store was $13.1 million, compared to $12.2 million in the year ago quarter. Retail segment income was $1.1 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We hosted 91 million visitors to our stores during the quarter compared to 85 million in the year-ago quarter. That translates the 17,500 visitors per store per week. Total company gross margin was 37.5%, which was at the low end of our guidance range of 37.5% to 38.5%. Operating expenses were $3.8 billion and included $488 million in stock based compensation expense. OI&amp;E was $347 million and the tax rate for the quarter was 26%</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">And turning to our cash, we ended the quarter with $144.7 billion in cash plus  short-term and long-term marketable securities compared to $137.1 billion at the end of the December quarter, a sequential increase of $7.6 billion. Over $102 billion of our total cash was offshore at the end of the March quarter, and cash flow from operations was $12.5 billion. We paid $2.5 billion in dividends in the March quarter, and earlier this month, we concluded the $1.95 billion accelerated share repurchase program that we initiated in the December quarter, resulting in cumulative<strong> </strong>retirement of over 4 million shares of Apple stock.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">As Tim discussed, we are pleased to announce that we are more than doubling our return of capital program to $100 billion by the end of calendar year 2015, which translates to an average of about $30 billion per year. We will continue to return capital to shareholders through dividends, share repurchases, and cash used to net-share-settle vesting RSUs. To facilitate our program, we will access the debt markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Let me provide more details regarding the three key elements of our plan. First, our Board has increased the share buyback authorization to $60 billion from the original $10 billion announced last year, that\u2019s a $50 billion increase. This is the largest share buyback authorization of any company in history. We are very confident in Apple\u2019s future and believe so strongly that repurchasing our shares represents an attractive use of our capital that we have dedicated a vast majority of the increase in our capital return program to share repurchases. We will buy shares under this authorization beginning this month. We will also continue to net-share-settle employee RSUs as they vest, and expect to use about $1 billion of cash annually to do this.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Second, we are increasing our quarterly dividend from $2.65 to $3.05 per share, a 15% increase. We plan to review our quarterly dividend payment annually. Our Board of Directors has declared a dividend of $3.05 per common share payable on May 16, 2013, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 13, 2013. We are very proud that Apple is among the largest dividend payers in the world with annual payments of about $11 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Third, we will access the U.S. debt markets over time and have recently secured credit ratings from S&amp;P and Moody\u2019s. We are continuing to generate significant cash offshore and repatriating this cash would result in significant tax consequences under current U.S. tax law.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Incorporating debt into our capital structure will provide several benefits including access to attractively priced capital, a reduction in our overall cost of capital and an efficient leverage of our very strong balance sheet. We expect to fund the capital return program from existing domestic cash, future cash generated in the U.S., and from borrowing in the U.S. We will maintain sufficient domestic liquidity to grow the business and execute capital expenditures and acquisitions. The program announced today will result in returning an average of $30 billion annually to shareholders.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">To put this in perspective, the $30 billion would have represented substantially all of our fiscal year 2012 fully tax free cash flow had we repatriated our foreign earnings. Between now and the end of calendar year 2015, we would expect both our foreign cash and our domestic borrowing to grow. We will continue to review each element of our capital return program on an annual basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">In conclusion, our capital return program is designed to facilitate our objective of delivering attractive returns to our shareholders on an efficient basis, while maintaining the flexibility to invest in the incredible opportunities that we continue to see for our business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Now, as we move ahead into the June quarter, I\u2019d like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $33.5 billion and $35.5 billion compared to $35 billion in the year-ago quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 36% and 37% reflecting approximately $90 billion related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be between $3.85 billion and $3.95 billion including about $500 million related to stock-based compensation. We expect OI&amp;E to be about $300 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">In closing, we are pleased with our record March quarter revenue and record March quarter iPhone and iPad sales. We\u2019re very proud  of the breadth and depth of our tremendous ecosystem and our new all-time record for iTunes sales. We are also in the fortunate position to be able to more than double our return of capital program to $100 billion with the larger share repurchase authorization in history and to be one of the largest dividend payers in the world with annual payments of about $11 billion. We remain very confident in our product pipeline.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">With that, I\u2019d like to open the call to questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Thank you, Peter. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Operator, may we have the first question please?</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p7\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">(Operator Instructions) First we\u2019ll go to Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Katy Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Thanks. Good afternoon. Peter, given gross margin did come in at the low end of guidance this quarter and you\u2019re looking for another downtick in June, can you just rank for us the biggest factors that are limiting the margin recovery even as I assume costs are coming down to the new products? And then, I have a follow-up.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Sure. In the March quarter, our gross margin was 37.5%. It was at the low end of our range. We had a few items that on balance resulted in us reporting at the low end. They included mix, in particular, selling more iPads than we had planned, including getting iPad mini into our four- to six-week channel inventory range, some changes in our service policies that required us to make provisions for prior quarter sales, and we had some unfavorable adjustments. As I look forward to the June quarter, we\u2019re guiding gross margin to be down between 50 basis points and 150 basis points sequentially. We see two factors impacting gross margin sequentially. First and the largest of the two is the loss of leverage on sequentially lower revenue; and second, a different product mix. We expect both of these headwinds to be partially offset by better cost in the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Katy Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. Thank you, and Tim, question for you on China. Growth did slow in that market to single digits this quarter, curious of your perspective as to whether Apple is hitting a wall given you don\u2019t have the largest carrier formally selling your products? And just any thoughts around the stickiness of customers in China given you don\u2019t have an iTunes store there, and data shows that they download fewer apps than in developed countries? Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Katy, thanks for the question. We actually had our best quarter ever in Greater China. So it was a record for us. The revenue came in at $8.8 billion. That includes our retail stores that are in that region that is up 11% year on year, again that includes the retail stores that are in that region, which is the same as Apple is growing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">The highlights for the quarter in China were that iPads grew 138% year-on-year, and we set new records for sell-through both for iPhone and iPad during the quarter. There were some significant year-over-year timing differences with regard to channel inventory relative to iPhone that affected the compares year-over-year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">In particular, in the year-ago quarter, we increased iPhone channel inventories globally by $2.6 billion, as you probably recall, $1.6 billion of $2.6 billion occurred in Greater China to support the launches that were in the March quarter of last year. And so, if you look at revenue on a sell-through basis, our Greater China revenue was actually up approximately 18%. And so it\u2019s a bit better than it first looked.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">As I said, in the year-ago quarter, we launched the iPhone 4S with China Unicom in January and we launched China Telecom in March; this year, the iPhone 5 launched in December. and so it\u2019s a very different set of dynamics on a year-on-year basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Going forward, we still see a significant opportunity in China, it\u2019s a great market. We have 11 stores there. we expect to double those in less than two years. We have added about 8,000 iPhone point-of-sales in the indirect channel to about 19,000 today and we obviously have a plan to add more and further grow our distribution, December is obviously too low currently. We\u2019re also innovating in our online, with our online store there in adding different functionality to the store.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">China has a unusually large number of potential first-time smartphone buyers, and that\u2019s not lost on us. We\u2019ve seen a significant interest in iPhone 4 there and have recently made it even more affordable to make it even more attractive to those first-time buyers. and so we\u2019re hopeful that will help iPhone sales in the future.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Katy Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thank you, Katy. Can we have the next question please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">From Goldman Sachs, we\u2019ll go to Bill Shope.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Bill C. Shope \u2013 Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay, thanks. Tim, you mentioned several factors that were compressing growth in gross margins in recent quarters in this year. but can you comment a bit more on the competitive landscape in 2013 versus 2012? how has it surprised you, and what do you think the company needs to do to reinvigorate your share gains across your key product categories?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Bill, I think the smartphone market has always been competitive. The names have been changed. the names of competitors have changed. In the beginning, RIM was sort of the very strongest player, because the smartphone as you know really got going into the enterprise area. And of course, today, our tough competitor from a hardware point of view would be Samsung and married to Google on the operating system side.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">They are obviously tough competitors, but we feel that we have the best products by far. And we are continuing to invest in innovative products and feel really, really confident about our product pipeline in both hardware, software and also our services. We have the best ecosystem by far, and we\u2019re just going to keep augmenting it, and making it better and better. and that shows up in both our royalty ratings and our customer stat and I feel very good about our competitive position.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Bill C. Shope \u2013 Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">One more question if I may. Can you comment on how you\u2019re thinking about the pace of your buyback program and what factors are you going to consider to determine purchase timing over the next few years?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Sure, Bill, it\u2019s Peter, I\u2019ll take that. We\u2019re going to begin buying shares under the authorization beginning this month. And we expect to utilize the remaining $58 billion under the authorization by the end of calendar year 2015, which spans 32 months from now. We expect to use accelerated share repurchase programs and to buy in the open market.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Bill C. Shope \u2013 Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thanks, Bill. Can we have the next question please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">From UBS, we\u2019ll go to Steve Milunovich.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Steven M. Milunovich \u2013 UBS Securities LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thank you very much. Tim, you alluded to fall announcements of products, is that indicating that there may not be substantial new products until literally fall late September, which means the September quarter could look a lot like the June quarter, is that part of what are implying or were you just being more general?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I don\u2019t want to be more specific, but I\u2019m just saying we\u2019ve got some really great stuff coming in the fall and across all of 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Steven M. Milunovich \u2013 UBS Securities LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. And then could you talk a bit about the supply chain, there has been some concern with some of the product limitations late last year, I mean it\u2019s got to be getting so huge relatively to what you used to run. But what\u2019s your confidence level in the supply chain particularly as you\u2019re potentially moving to new types of vendors over time as the units continue to increase?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I have incredible confidence. We exited the March quarter with no shortages while achieving inventory turns of over 90, which is still to this day is staggering for our industry. The December quarter that you\u2019re referring to was the largest quarter ever in the history of Apple and the technology industry as a whole. And as you know, it included for us a number of new products and unprecedented number and of new product ramps. The reality is the work we do to produce truly innovative products is very hard and there has always been challenges that I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll face some in the future. However, I would assure you that we are working very closely with our manufacturing partners to execute what we feel is a very exciting roadmap.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thanks, Steve. Can we have next question please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">From Sanford Bernstein, we\u2019ll go to Toni Sacconaghi.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Toni M. Sacconaghi \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yes, thank you. I wanted to revisit the gross margin question. and specifically, I was hoping you could comment on whether you feel you\u2019re experiencing that the normal kinds of experience curves or declining cost curves that you do in typical product ramps. And whether you could comment on the sequential decline in iPhone ASPs, which were down nearly $30 sequentially, I presume that reflects a mix of 4 and 4S relative to the 5. But perhaps, you can confirm that in what its impact might have on gross margins and how we should think about that? and I have a follow-up please.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yeah. Toni, it\u2019s Peter, I\u2019ll take your first two. We\u2019re very pleased with the progress that we\u2019re making on getting down cost curves and this will help to partially offset the loss of leverage and the different product mix that we expect to see in the June quarter and we have factored these cost improvements into the guidance we\u2019re providing for the quarter. The iPhone ASPs were down sequentially about $28 as you noted. And this was driven primarily by mix. The largest factors were an increase in the iPhone 4 mix, which resulted from or making the iPhone 4 more affordable in many markets. And also mix within the iPhone 5 as it was in its second full quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Toni M. Sacconaghi \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And its impact on margins, how do we think about relative margins for 4 relative to 5 on balance?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Toni, we don\u2019t provide margins by product or within product line. But I talked about two factors that were impacting gross margin on a sequential basis. The first is leveraging, that\u2019s largest of the two on the lower sequential revenue. But we also expect to see a different product mix and that\u2019s primarily related to iPhone.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Toni M. Sacconaghi \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. And then\u2026</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Toni, just one other point on that is, as you get further, we see this on most of our product line, as you get further from a previous product launch, there is a general within a line, a general lower mix than where it starts. And so you\u2019d expect, all things being equal, you\u2019d expect to see that on most of our products.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Toni M. Sacconaghi \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. Thank you. Tim, I wanted to follow-up with you on a statement you made in a previous response. You talked earlier about how you are excited about the large addressable markets that you have particularly, the smartphone and tablet marketplaces. And you talked about how strongly and confidently, you feel about competitive advantages in your products and ecosystems. If I step back and look at the data for this quarter on the phone side, if I adjust for inventory, the iPhone was up very low to mid single digits. I think most third-party market data would say that the smartphone market probably grew about 30%. And if I look broadly incorporating your guidance for next quarter and thinking about fiscal Q1, it appears very unlikely that Apple will grow at that market rate of 30% or more. So I am wondering if you could comment on a) whether that [extent of the] [ph] loss in market share is something that is \u2013 Apple has focused on or cares about as a principle financial objective? And if so, why do you think there is this disconnect between the very attractive products that you are offering and the market data that I just cited?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So, Toni, let me try to address, you mentioned both smartphones and tablets and so let me try to address both of those. First let me start with the tablet side, the numbers that we\u2019ve seen from IDC would indicate that they believe the market in March declined by 30% from December, December being obviously seasonally high quarter with a holiday. As you can see from our numbers, we declined 15%. And so if that holds, we did much better than the market and had a very nice pick up in market share.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And, obviously, on iPad, we continue to have an ecosystem story that is unparalleled, we have 350,000 apps that are optimized for iPad versus a few hundred for our competition and the overall experience in the fit and finish of the product, I think, we agree is substantially better than the options there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">On the phone side, the numbers that you talked about, the sell-in comparisons year-over \u2013year, you really have to convert that to sell-through to look at the underlying demand. And as I\u2019ve gone through before, we did grow channel inventory in the year ago quarter because we were catching up on the roll out of the iPhone 4S, in fact, we grew by 2.6 million. And so you have to factor in to get at the real sell-through.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">However, I take your point if the market did grow by 30%, we still, after that normalization, we grew less than that. And so I think the question or the \u2013 this point is not lost and we do want to grow faster. We don\u2019t view it, however, as the only measure of our health. The things that are very important to us in addition to market share and unit volumes include things like customer stat, which were the highest by far winning J.D. Power\u2019s nine times consecutively and the customer loyalty and repurchase rates, which were the highest by far the 95% according to Kantar. And the ecosystem commerce, which attracts developers is incredible, Canalys says that we have 74%, so basically $3 out of $4 that are spent on apps are spent in our ecosystem.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And if you then looked at usage statistics, they are staggering at the usage of iOS versus other operating systems. And so market shares are important and unit volumes are important, but these other things for us are extremely important, because we are all about customer experience and enriching lives.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Now, that said, we see an enormous number of first time smartphone buyers coming to market, particularly, in certain countries around the world. And so what we\u2019ve done with that is and we started last quarter is we\u2019ve made the iPhone 4 even more affordable and which has made it more attractive to first time buyers and we caught up on the \u2013 our supply - demand towards the late in the quarter last quarter and we are continuing to do that in other markets. And we believe that the phone or the price point that we are offering is an incredible value for people, that allows them to get into the ecosystem with a really, really, phenomenal product.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Thank you, Tony. The next question please.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">From Barclays we\u2019ll go to Ben Reitzes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Ben A. Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Thanks a lot. I appreciate it. Tim and Peter, can you comment on gross margin beyond next quarter maybe what does it say about long-term gross margins if 36 to 37 is the margin that you are calling for when your highest margin product, let\u2019s hope is that a trough for the year and I think you are implying that when you say all these new products are coming in the fall.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So is there an implied margin philosophy here with this 2Q guide that 36 is as low as you wanted to get and then maybe it gets better from there or is there nothing that we should imply in terms of how the company views gross margins?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Ben, it\u2019s Peter. I\u2019ll start on that one. It\u2019s been our long-term practice, we\u2019re not providing specific gross margin guidance beyond the June quarter. We don\u2019t do this, because there are many factors that can influence gross margins and a specific quarter and cause them to vary widely over time, including product cycles, commodity markets, product mix, and currencies.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So while we don\u2019t want to make a forecast beyond June, let me tell you how we think about gross margin and hopefully this will help. We are managing the business for the long-term and are willing to trade off short-term profit where we see long-term potential. The iPod is a great example of this. When we launched it in 2001, its margins were significantly below the margins of Apple at that time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Four years later, the iPod and the iTunes Music Store comprised half of Apple\u2019s revenues and inspired us to build the iPhone. The iPad mini is another great example. We have priced it aggressively and its margins are significantly below the corporate average. However, we believe deeply in the long-term potential of the tablet market and think that we\u2019ve made a great strategic decision. We\u2019ll only make great products and this precludes us from making cheap products that don\u2019t deliver a great experience.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">We believe deeply that there are people in every part of the world that want great products. Looking back over the last several years, we\u2019ve made very good business decisions balancing units, revenues, and the bottom line. We think about all three and as I said, we\u2019re willing to make short-term trade-offs and profits, where we see long-term potential.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And we\u2019re managing Apple with a very long-term horizon. Some of our revenues and profits occur after we ship our products. We were thrilled to exceed this quarter $4 billion in revenue for our services for the first time. And as Tim mentioned, we will augment our very strong ecosystem with new services and make the current ones even, even better. So we remain very confident in our strategy and we will use our world-class skills in engineering and operations to manage our business well in the future.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Ben A. Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">All right, thanks. And Tim, my follow-up just for you, just maybe asking you this every quarter in different ways. But I just wanted to get your reaction to what you thought of the 5-inch phone market at this time versus three months ago? And if anything has changed in your view as to that market and its place in the smartphone world versus your 4-inch product? And that\u2019s it from me.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yeah Ben, that\u2019s a good question. My view continues to be that iPhone 5 has the absolute best display in the industry. And we always strive to create the very best display for our customers. And some customers value large screen size, others value also other factors such as resolution, color quality, white balance, brightness, reflectivity, screen longevity, power consumption, portability, compatibility with apps and many things.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Our competitors had made some significant trade-offs in many of these areas in order to ship a larger display, we would not ship a larger display iPhone while these trade-offs exist.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Ben A. Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Got it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Does that answer?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Ben A. Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Ben A. Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes, got it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thanks, Ben. Can we have the next question please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">We\u2019ll go to Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Gene E. Munster \u2013 Piper Jaffray, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Hey, good afternoon. Tim, I just wanted to confirm, did you mention in your prepared remarks that something about new product categories or did I not hear you correctly?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I did, Gene. I said that one of our areas for growth are potential new categories, and we\u2019re very excited about those.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Gene E. Munster \u2013 Piper Jaffray, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And that would presumably be kind of in the next year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Well, I didn\u2019t announce the specific timeframe, but\u2026</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Gene E. Munster \u2013 Piper Jaffray, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. And Peter, you mentioned new services in that you can kind of build and kind of improve on existing services, and I guess, beyond just the natural evolution of maybe Maps and iCloud, are there any other kind of key assets that you guys have which you can leverage in the new services?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Well, nothing specific, Gene, but we are very fortunate to have the largest and broadest ecosystem in the world. We have App Stores in 155 countries and iTunes Stores in over 110 countries. We have hundreds of millions of users. we\u2019ve just crossed a $16 billion run rate on the iTunes Stores in terms of billings, and just achieved for the first time $4 billion in revenue for our services. So we\u2019re really thrilled with what we\u2019ve just reported this quarter, but we see opportunity that we\u2019re going to invest in tremendously to delight our customers and continue to grow our business in those areas.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And I would just add to that, because we are not fragmented like our competition, we can update an iOS<strong> </strong>with a major release and a substantial percentage of our customers will update to the \u2013 to our latest offer. We\u2019ve made that very elegant and very easy. Also because the usage for iOS is so much higher, when we integrate things well, people use them a lot more and so just those concepts by itself are huge advantages from a customer experience point of view and from a more of the metrics that you\u2019re thinking about point of view.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Gene E. Munster \u2013 Piper Jaffray, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. Let met ask you this way in terms of just the payment<strong> </strong>market specifically, I mean, do you feel that that market is well addressed today with the offerings out there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I think it\u2019s in its infancy, Gene. I think it\u2019s just getting started and just out of the starting block.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Thanks, Gene<strong>.</strong> Can we have the next question please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">From Cross Research, we\u2019ll go to Shannon Cross</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Shannon S. Cross \u2013 Cross Research LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Thank you very much. Tim, I was wondering if you could talk a bit about what you\u2019re thinking about within the Mac market and PC market because obviously you outperformed substantially the competition but we\u2019re still down about 2%. So I am curious as to whether or not you think elasticity of demand with lower prices or what you are hearing from your customers in terms of their reluctance to buy a new Mac and then also how you\u2019re thinking about the cannibalization potential that\u2019s coming out of the iPad?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I think the, Shannon, I think the reason that we were down last quarter, we were down 2% as you had mentioned. The market for PCs are incredibly weak. IDC said that the market for the March quarter was down 14% year-on-year, which is the largest decline that I remember from being in this industry for a long time. At the same time, we sold almost 20 million iPads and it\u2019s certainly true that some of those iPads cannibalized some Macs. I personally don\u2019t think it was a huge number, but do I think it\u2019s some, and I think probably the larger thing at least for the, maybe not so much on the Macs side, but on the PC side, it\u2019s cheaper, probably extending their upgrade cycles.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">That said, I don\u2019t think this market is a dead market or bad market by any means. I think it has a lot of life to it. We are going to continue to innovate in it. We believe that if anything the huge growth in tablets may wind up benefiting the Mac, because it pushes people to think about the product they\u2019re buying in a different manner and people maybe even more willing to buy a Mac where today than may be buying a PC. And so we\u2019re going to continue making the best personal computers. our strategy is not changing. And we feel really good about it. We delivered some incredible innovation last year with Retina display with the MacBook Pro, an incredible thin and light package and we\u2019ve got some more great stuff plan. So this is an area we\u2019re continuing to invest in.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Shannon S. Cross \u2013 Cross Research LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. And just a follow-up question with regard to the tablet market. We\u2019ve met with some of your competitors recently and they\u2019re starting to talk about wins in the enterprise, and touting the benefits of Microsoft and some of the other OS\u2019s that are out there in terms of security and interoperability in some of the enterprise companies. So I\u2019m curious what you\u2019ve heard from your customers, have you seen much displacement and what are sort of the discussions that you have with enterprise customers with regard to iPads and fitting into their systems? Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">We seem to be doing really well and Peter had referenced earlier, the Good Technology\u2019s data that says that iOS accounted for 77% of all their activations by their corporate customers. Now that would not include BlackBerry, but it would include all the other guys. and so we seem to be doing really well and honestly, I don\u2019t see the recent announcements changing that at all. I\u2019ve seen more and more people developing more and more custom apps for their businesses on iOS to be used on iPad and we\u2019re very, very bullish on it. As a matter of fact, just to quote you some numbers, iPad now is being used in 95% of the Fortune 500 and what\u2019s even more impressive probably is on the global 500 companies, we\u2019re now in 89%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Shannon S. Cross \u2013 Cross Research LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yeah.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Thanks, Shannon. Can we have the next question please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">We\u2019ll go to Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Mark A. Moskowitz \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Thank you. Tim, earlier you talked about how the December quarter had a very big and broad product refresh, were there any learning<strong> </strong>points from that experience in terms of maybe it\u2019s better to stage or kind of stagger out launches over multi-quarters versus one quarter. How should we think about that going forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">It\u2019s a good question. I don\u2019t spend a lot of time looking back except to learn from it, and if we could run it over frankly, I would have announced the iMac after the turn of the year, because we felt<strong> </strong>our customers had to wait too long for that specific product; or the iPad mini was in shortage in the December quarter I would not have done that differently, because we were able to get the iPad mini out to many millions of customers who really wanted that product for their holiday. And so, yes, we did do a lot, our teams fortunately can do a lot, but in retrospect that one, yeah, I sort of wish it were after the turn of the year, because our customers would not have had to wait as long as they did.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Mark A. Moskowitz \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. And then my follow-up question is back to the ecosystem. Are there other metrics or milepost you can share with us, you acknowledged earlier that the growth of revenue at Apple have slowed for some of your key products. But how about the ecosystem in terms of usage rates, are you seeing slowing there or are you actually seeing the opposite where there\u2019s maybe acceleration within each user?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">We see incredible usage in every study that we see. These aren\u2019t just done by us, as a matter of fact the vast majority of them come from other people. The usage of iOS devices are staggering compared to others. It\u2019s a phenomenal difference. And I think that shows the strength of the ecosystem.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Mark A. Moskowitz \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And Mark this is Peter. I will add that, we are now paying very happily our developers more than $1 billion every quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Mark A. Moskowitz \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Thanks, Mark.

Speaking first today is Apple\u2019s CFO, Peter Oppenheimer and he will be joined by CEO, Tim Cook; and Treasurer, Gary Wipfler for the Q&amp;A session with analysts.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Please note that some of the information you\u2019ll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation, those regarding revenues, gross margins, operating expenses, other income and expense, stock-based compensation expense, taxes, future products and capital allocation plans. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple\u2019s Form 10-K for 2012, the Form 10-Q for the second quarter of the 2013 and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Peter Oppenheimer for introductory remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you, Nancy. We are pleased to report the results of our third fiscal quarter. We established a new June quarter record for iPhone sales driving Apple\u2019s strongest June quarter revenue ever.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Revenue for the quarter was $35.3 billion, up $300 million or 1% from the year ago quarter, and at the high end of our guidance range. Gross margin was 36.9% also at the high end of our guidance range, and operating margin was $9.2 billion representing 26% of revenue. Net income was $6.9 billion translating to the diluted earnings per share of $7.47. Channel inventories declined sequentially by $1 billion during the June quarter this year meaning that sell-through was $36.3 billion. In contrast, channel inventory increased $700 million from the beginning to the end of the June quarter last year meaning that sell-through was $34.3 billion in that quarter. As such, our June quarter sell-through increased by $2 billion, or 6% year-over-year ahead of our 1% [selling and] [ph] revenue growth.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">As for the details of the quarter, I\u2019d like to begin with iPhone. We sold 31.2 million iPhones compared to 26 million in the year ago quarter, an increase of 5.2 million, or 20%. We had a sequential decrease of about 600,000 iPhones in channel inventory in the June quarter translating to iPhone sell-through of about 31.8 million units. iPhone sales were ahead of our expectations and we were particularly pleased with very strong year-over-year growth in iPhone sales in a number of both developed and emerging markets including the U.S., UK, Japan, Brazil, Russia, India, Thailand and Singapore. iPhone 5 remains by far the most popular iPhone but we were also happy with sales of iPhone 4 and 4s. We exited the quarter with about 11 million units of total iPhones in channel inventory and ended within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPhone channel inventory.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">iPhone unit sales in the U.S. increased 51% compared to the year ago quarter and based on research recently published by comScore, iPhone once again achieved the number one spot in the U.S. smartphone market for the three months period ended in May with over 39% share. iPhone sales were also very strong in Japan growing [66%] [ph] year-over-year. iPhone is the top selling smartphone in Japan based on the latest published quarterly data from IDC and Apple is the number one or number two selling smartphone manufacturer in most markets IDC tracks including North America, Western Europe, Russia, Turkey, Australia, Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">The most recently published study by Kantar measured at 93% loyalty rate among iPhone owners significantly higher than our competitors. And iPhone continues to lead in terms of customer experience. Not only has iPhone earned the top spot in customer satisfaction from J.D. Power and Associates, an unprecedented nine consecutive times it has also received the top customer satisfaction ranking in a number of surveys including the recent Quality Insights survey of smartphone customers in South Korea. iPhone also continues to be the smartphone of choice for business. Given the security and stability of iOS, enterprise and government customers around the world continue to deploy iPhone on their network in ways that go far beyond personal productivity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Companies have built tens of thousands of custom apps to improve every aspect of their business. Global companies including American Airlines, Cisco, General Electric, Roche and SAP have deployed more than 25,000 iPhones each across their organizations. U.S. government organizations such NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Lab, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the ATF and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency are supporting and managing thousands of iPhones on their networks and continue to create both customer facing and internal iOS apps.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">And just this past quarter iOS 6 was granted FIPS 140-2 validation by the U.S. federal government and approval by the U.S. Department of Defense to connect to their networks. Combining sales to business, government and education customers, iPhone holds a 62.5% share of the U.S. commercial market based on the latest quarterly data published by IDC.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Turning to iPad we sold 14.6 million iPads during the quarter compared to 17 million in the year ago quarter. The tough year-over-year comparison was driven by both the significant channel inventory increase and the first full quarter of the availability of the third generation iPad in the year ago quarter. We built 1.2 million units of iPad channel inventory in the June quarter last year whereas we reduced channel inventory by 700,000 units in the June quarter this year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Factoring in this 1.9 million unit channel inventory swing, iPad unit sell-through was down 3% year-over-year. We exited the quarter with about 4.1 million units of iPad channel inventory within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Customers continue to love their iPads, for the second consecutive time in the two year history of a survey, iPad ranked number one in the 2013 U.S. tablet satisfaction survey by J.D. Power and Associates and again in its latest study published today [Chitika] [ph] reported that iPad accounted for 84.3% share of tablet web usage by customers in the U.S. and Canada, its highest level this year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In every major industry around the world companies are developing, deploying and supporting apps for iPad. Government organizations as well as global enterprise companies across diverse fields including automotive, insurance, energy services and healthcare are using iPad and custom apps to create unique meaningful experiences for their employees, partners, and customers. The USDA\u2019s National Agricultural Statistics Service has deployed thousands of iPads to in-person interviewers resulting in higher response rates and decreased cost. And companies including Eli Lilly, Novartis, Cathay Life, Roche, and SAP have deployed over 20,000 iPads each across their organizations.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to Mac, we are pleased with sales of 3.8 million Macs, which is a 7% decline from the year ago quarter, but higher than our expectations. IDC estimates that the global personal computer market contracted by 11% during the June quarter, indicating that Macs gained share. In June, we introduced two new versions of MacBook Air and customer response has been great. Wired magazine described the new 13-inch MacBook Air as nearly flawless citing its phenomenal battery life, processing performance, feather-light chassis, and super-fast WiFi. Additionally, last month, we provided a sneak-peek at our next generation Mac Pro engineered around the workstation graphics with dual GPUs, PCI Express-based flash storage, high-performance Thunderbolt 2, next generation Xeon processors, ultra-fast memory and support for 4-K video. The new state-of-the-art Mac Pro will be assembled in the U.S. and will be available later this year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We were excited to release to developer preview of OS X Mavericks last month. More than 200 new features, OS - with more than 200 new features, OS X Mavericks brings Maps and iBooks to the Mac, introduces Finder Tags and Tabs, enhances multi-display support for power users, delivers new core technologies for breakthrough power efficiency and performance, and includes an all-new version of Safari. OS X Mavericks will be available to customers in the fall. We ended the quarter with just below our 4 to 5 week target range of Mac channel inventory.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Our U.S. education institution business had a great quarter generating its highest quarterly revenue ever. The results were fueled by all-time record quarterly iPad sales of 1.1 million units in addition to strong June quarter Mac sales. The state of Maine\u2019s Learning Technology Initiative, which provides the state\u2019s little school and high school students and teachers with personal computing solutions allowed individual school districts to choose which products to purchase rather than standardized on a single statewide solution. We are very proud that an estimated 94% of the 69,000 total units selected this year were Apple products. And we are extremely pleased to have received the Los Angeles School Board of Education\u2019s unanimous approval to begin the first phase of a massive rollout of iPads to students across the district starting this fall. The district is the second largest in the United States and plans to equip every one of its 660,000 students with a tablet by 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We continue to be very pleased with the growth and the strength of the Apple ecosystem. With the broadest geographic reach and depth of content in the industry, our iTunes Stores generated record billings of $4.3 billion in the June quarter culminating in our best months and best week ever for App Store billings at the very end of the quarter. The quarter\u2019s iTunes billings translated to quarterly revenue of $2.4 billion, up 29% from the year ago quarter with strong growth in revenue in both content and apps. The continued strong iTunes sales combined with other software and service revenue resulted in total quarterly revenue of $4 billion from iTunes software and services. We added some great new video content to iTunes and Apple TV.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Last month we announced HBO GO and WatchESPN are now available directly on Apple TV joining programming from Hulu Plus, Netflix\u2019s streaming catalog, live sports from MLB, NBA and NHL as well as Internet content from Vimeo, YouTube and Flickr. Sky News, Crunchyroll and Qello are offering live news, sports and current TV programming. Apple TV users can now choose from a broad selection of programming including over 60,000 movies and over 230,000 TV episodes as well as the world\u2019s largest collection of music on the iTunes Store.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">iTunes users have downloaded more than 1 billion TV episodes and 390 million movies from iTunes to-date, and they are purchasing over 800,000 TV episodes and over 350,000 movies per day. We recently celebrated the five year anniversary of our amazing app store. Our developers have now created more than 900,000 iOS apps including 375,000 apps made for iPad. The popularity of these apps remains incredibly strong.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Cumulative app downloads have surpassed 50 billion and app developers have made over $11 billion for their sales through the App Store half of which was earned in the last four quarters. Our vibrant ecosystem continues to drive tremendous user engagement with our devices and services and we now have over 320 million iPod accounts and 240 million Game Center accounts and our customers have sent almost 900 billion iMessages, uploaded over a 125 billion photos and received over 8 trillion push notifications. And thanks to the stability and security and popularity of the iOS platform, the iOS devices continue to have a strong lead over Android in the enterprise.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In its most recently published quarterly enterprise device activations report, the technology is found that among its corporate clients iPhone 5 was by far the most frequently updated device of any kind and iPad\u2019s represent 88% of all tablet activations. We\u2019re continuing to invest in software and services to make the ecosystem and user experience even richer. This fall we will release a beta version of iWork for iCloud bringing pages, numbers and keynotes to the web. With iWork for iCloud users will be able to create great looking letters, reports and flyers, generate complex yet beautiful spreadsheets and develop and deliver beautiful presentations with powerful graphics and special effects all from within a web browser.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">And we\u2019re extremely excited about the fall launch of iOS 7 with its stunning new user interface and many great new features including control center, AirDrop and iTunes Radio, smarter multi-tasking and enhancements to notification center, photos, Safari and Siri.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">I would now like to turn to the Apple retail stores, revenue for the quarter was 4.1 billion approximately equal to the year ago quarter. The stores experienced strong growth in iPhone sales and have been most successful MacBook Air launch to-date.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We opened six new stores across five countries during the quarter and end of the quarter with a total of 408 stores including a 156 outside of United States. We expect over nine new stores in the September quarter getting us to a total of 27 new store openings in fiscal 13. We also relocated four stores in the June quarter that had outgrown their former space and we expect to complete and total of 23 such relocations in fiscal \u201913. With an average of 405 stores opened in the June average revenue per store was 10.1 million compared to 11.1 million in the year ago quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Retail segment income was 667 million; we hosted 84 million visitors to our stores during the quarter this translates to 16,000 visitors per store per week. Operating expenses were 3.8 billion and included 488 million in stock based compensation expense. OI&amp;E was 234 million and the tax rate for the quarter was 26.9%. And turning to our cash we ended the quarter with a 146.6 billion in cash plus short term and long term marketable securities compared to a 144.7 billion at the end of the March quarter, a sequential increase of 1.9 billion. A 106 billion of our total cash was offshored at the end of the June quarter and cash flow from operations with 7.8 billion. In early April we concluded the 1.95 billion accelerated share repurchase program that we initiated in December quarter resulted in cumulative retirement of over 4 million shares of Apple stock under that program.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In late April we executed a very successful debt offering issuing 17 billion of debt across 3, 5, 10 and 30 year maturities. We paid 2.8 billion in dividends in the quarter and we also utilized a total of 16 billion in cash on share repurchase activity through a combination of a new accelerated share repurchase program and open market purchases. 12 billion of the 16 billion was utilized under a new ASR program initiated with two financial institutions in April.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">An initial delivery of 23.5 million shares was made under this program with the final number of shares delivered in average price per share to be determined at the conclusion of the program, based on the volume weighted average purchase price of Apple\u2019s stock over the program period, which will conclude in fiscal \u201814. In addition to the new ASR, we executed 4 billion of open market share repurchases, resulting in the retirement of 9 million additional shares. Our Board of Directors has declared a dividend of $3.05 per common share payable on August 15, 2013, the shareholders of record as of the close of business on August 12, 2013.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Now, as we move ahead into the March quarter, I would like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $34 billion and $37 billion compared to $36 billion in the year ago quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 36% and 37% reflecting approximately $90 billion related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be between $3.9 billion and $3.95 billion, including about $495 million related to stock-based compensation. We expect OI&amp;E to be about $200 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 26.5%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">In closing, we are pleased with our record June quarter iPhone sales, the strong growth in revenue from iTunes software and services, and the continued enhancement and popularity of our tremendously vibrant ecosystem. We are very excited about the upcoming releases of the stunning new iOS 7 in OS X Mavericks, and we are very hard at work on some amazing new products that we will introduce in the fall in across 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">And with that, I\u2019d like to open the call to questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Thank you, Peter. And we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Operator, may we have the first question please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"></p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p5\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">(Operator Instructions) Your first question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Yes, thanks. Peter, as you mentioned in the press release today, new products will ship this fall, and historically, gross margins do come down in a product transition quarter, but that\u2019s not reflected in your outlook, so can you talk about why this product cycle might be different?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Katy, as I said in my prepared remarks, we expect our gross margins to be between 36% and 37%, which is consistent with what we expected in the June quarter. And on a sequential basis, that would mean that gross margin would be largely flat to slightly down. We are on track to have a very busy fall. I would like to leave it there and go into more detail on October.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Okay. As a follow-up, can you talk about of why you think channel inventory came down more than seasonally this quarter and also inventory on your balance sheet was up significantly, is that a direct result of the channel wanting to hold back inventory?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Katy, I will take the balance sheet part of your question and Tim can talk about the channel.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">The inventory on the balance sheet was really up for two reasons. First, we have got more storage this year than we had last. So, our finished goods inventory was a part of the inventory increase and then our components inventory was up as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Katy, it\u2019s Tim. From an iPad point of view, or iPad and iPhone, we reduced inventory, and reduced it fairly significantly. iPad was down over 700,000 units in the beginning of the quarter and iPhone was down over 600. As you know from working with us over several quarters, we typically don\u2019t like to have any more inventory than we need. And so if we can find a way to reduce, we do so. And we have done that in both of these cases. We also have slight decreases in the Macintosh area and on iPod.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Thanks, Katy. Can we have the next question please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">From Goldman Sachs, we will go to Bill Shope.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay, great. Thanks. I have a bit of a longer term question. Despite the fairly substantial iPhone upside this quarter, there has been increasing concerns at the high-end of the smartphone markets reaching a saturation point and that growth may be harder to come by for really for all vendors. What\u2019s your perspective on that and the current industry dynamics? And Tim, do you think there are new innovations and services in the pipeline that can reinvigorate the premium segment of the market after what\u2019s obviously been a bit tough 2013 to that segment, to the industry.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Well from a growth point of view for Apple our key catalysts will be, always will be new products and new services and these are above in existing categories that we\u2019re in and in new categories. In addition to this we have opportunities and distribution from carrier relationships to expanding our retail stores, expanding our online store and continuing to expand the indirect channel and we also have a market expansion opportunity, Peter mentioned enterprise in his comments and the share positions that we have there over 60% in both iPad and iPhone and I think we\u2019re at the very front end of that and so I think we have lots of growth opportunities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">And I don't subscribe to the common view that the higher end if you will of the smartphone market is at its peak. I don\u2019t believe that but we will see and we will report our result as we go along.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay, great. And then on the iPad side of the equation. Looking at sell through decline this quarter obviously ex the channel inventory dynamics, should we think of this as more of a pause within your customer base ahead of your next refresh as we see in the past or is there a broader industry dynamic at play within tablets that could contribute to that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">For us if you look year-over-year. We had 2.4 million unit decline but 80% of that or 1.9 million units were just due to changes in channel inventory. As I think Peter referenced earlier, we reduced by over 700 in the current quarter and the year ago quarter had an increase of 1.2 and so the underlying sell through declined by just 3%. If you look at the situation that we\u2019re in in the year ago quarter we had just announced the third-generation iPad which was our first iPad with a retina display. We had announced in March and so that was our first full quarter and so from what Peter and I expected 90 days ago we hit within the midpoint of the range that we expected to hit on iPad unit sales and so it was not a surprise to us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">In terms of how other people are doing, I don't know. What I can tell you is that most recent data I have gotten which actually just came out I believe this morning is that the iPad Web share data shows that through the quarter we accelerated further and are now, iPad accounts for 84% of the web traffic from tablets which is absolutely incredible and so if there are lots of other tablets selling I don't know what they are being used for because that\u2019s a pretty, the basic function is web browser.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We feel really good about where we are. Peter had mentioned earlier we had an incredible quarter in U.S. education setting a new record for iPad. We\u2019re really happy to be selected for the first phase of 660,000 unit roll out at LA Unified and really bold move they are making to change teaching and learning and we had double-digit unit growth in China, for iPad in Japan, in Canada, in Latin America, in Russia, in the Middle East and in India and so we\u2019re really happy with what we saw.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Thanks Bill. Can we have the next question please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">From Sanford Bernstein, we will go to Toni Sacconaghi.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Antonio Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">I was wondering if you could provide some kind of gross margin bridge sequentially, I think last quarter you had about a 90 basis point one time impact from the China warranty accrual. So if we adjust for that gross margins were down about a 150 basis points sequentially, and the mix of products was relatively similar to last quarter given that you\u2019re also riding the experience curve in these products, I was surprised given the mix that gross margins were as down as much sequentially as they were. Can you provide a bridge on a sequential basis on what happened with gross margins?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Sure. First of all, let me say, we are very pleased with gross margin in the quarter at 36.9%. It was at really the high end of the range that we provided of 36% to 37%. And the sequential decline was not a surprise to us. We understood the warranty effects in March. And as I said on last quarter\u2019s call, we expect that our margins to be down sequentially primarily for two reasons. The first is the lower sequential revenue, so we lost leverage going from March to June, and we expected a different product mix. And as you can see, we reported very near the top end of that and feel good.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Antonio Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Right, but Peter, the mix ultimately was not that different I think iPhones were 52.5% last quarter, they were 51.5%. So, it actually seems like your mix was perhaps better than you had anticipated. So, I appreciate the volume revenue mix, but was your mix exactly in line with what you expected?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Well we had some puts and takes within the quarter, but it was \u2013 it ultimately ended up within the range that we thought it would be and we hit the high end.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Antonio Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. The second one I was wondering whether you could comment on was just iPhone ASPs, they were down about 5% sequentially or down about 10% over the last two quarters. I presume that\u2019s principally due to a higher mix of 4s and 4Ss, but I was wondering if you could comment on what\u2019s driving that change in ASP and whether it\u2019s more pronounced in certain geographies versus others?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">We were down 4% year-over-year on the iPhone ASP about $27, and that was primarily due to the mix of the products that we are selling and FX headwinds. As we anticipated iPhone 4 sales accelerated as we offered more affordable pricing in emerging and other markets, so that\u2019s on a year-over-year basis. And then sequentially, it was down about $32, and again, that was driven by mix as well in part iPhone 4. Tim, do you want make comments about what we may have seen in the regions?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Yes, sure. From an iPhone point of view, Toni, with the moves that we made on 4 and with iPhone 5 continuing to be the most popular model we saw very strong sales in several of the emerging markets or prepaid markets. India was up over 400%. Turkey and Poland were both up over 60%. The Philippines were up about 140%. And in addition, we saw very strong iPhone sales in several of the developed markets. For example, the U.S. was up over 50%, Japan up over 60%, the UK about 50%, and so we had several regions, where iPhone growth actually accelerated from the previous quarter, which is a unusual pattern for us and we were very, very happy with this.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Antonio Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And notably absent from that list was China, was that was your pricing how you treated to change pricing this quarter relative to previous quarters any different in China than the rest of the world?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">China was weaker in the quarter, although the datasheet that obviously focuses on revenue doesn\u2019t really tell the complete story here. If you look at sell-through as we have mentioned earlier with the inventory changes, it\u2019s important to do that. And so our sell-through in China was only down 4% from the year ago quarter when you normalized for channel inventory. Hong Kong was actually down more significantly. Mainland China was actually up year-over-year. It was up 5%, but that is the lower growth rate than we have been seeing and are attributed to many things including the economy there clearly doesn\u2019t help us or nor others. In Hong Kong, Hong Kong is an international shopping haven as you know for not only tourist but also some resellers and we saw more dramatic downturn there, it's not totally clear exactly what had occurred but it was down on a sell through basis by about 20% so that weighed greater China down as you can see in your data sheet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thank you Tony. Can we have the next question please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Ben Reitzes with Barclays.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Ben Reitzes - Barclays Capital</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">The question that I wanted ask was with regard to, there's been a lot of talk about a trade-in program that you guys are going to start even doing on your own with regard iPhone\u2019s, is there any update on that, and if so is that something that could help margins and help expand your emerging market sales and how is that going to work? Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Ben we haven't announced anything relative to a trade-in program<strong> </strong>so what you\u2019ve seen is rumor oriented. There are a number of channels that do trade-in programs now not only in the U.S. but in different regions and the reason that it's so attractive around iPhone is that the residual value of an iPhone stay so high and there is so much demand for it and so that makes the trade-in programs more lucrative to a win-win from many points of view. But we haven't announced anything about us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Ben Reitzes - Barclays Capital</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Are you opposed to it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">No I\u2019m not opposed to it. I see channels doing it and I like the environmental aspect of it and so that part of it really is encouraging today.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Ben Reitzes - Barclays Capital</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay, then really quick on China you answered some of it in the question before but how do we turn it around here, China and other APAC, what can we do to make it turn, you know there has been some press in China that obviously you had to deal with and when do we see that market turning and even though investors are worried about it from a secular point of view as well as the economy there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I think it's important to put in perspective. If you combine the stores (ph) that we have in Greater China our revenues there were 4.9 billion for the quarter and so that 14% powered the company which is very significant and in a few years that was in 100s of millions and so we have run our business there significantly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">We have a very strong market there and in the last 12 months we have done 27 billion on a trailing basis and so it's a huge business for us. Underlying the results are, if you look at iPad sell through in greater China was up 8% but the sell through in Mainland China was up 37% and so iPad is doing remarkably well. The latest share numbers we have seen on iPad for the tablet market is over 50% and year-to-date iPad units are up 48% year-over-year and so there have been direct growth there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">From an ecosystem point of view we continue to attract a lot of developers from China. We now have about a 0.5 million developers in China that are working on iOS apps and that\u2019s up almost 70% year-over-year and so I think that\u2019s in top economy (ph) for China but for outside of China is many offered their apps through, in different stores around the world. We\u2019re obviously paying the developers quite a bit and so that\u2019s furthering advancement of the ecosystem of developers. We\u2019re continuing to invest in distribution, we\u2019re going to double the number of retail stores there for the next two years and we\u2019re continuing to lift iPhone point of sales and iPad sales both of which are currently lower than where we would them or need them today but we\u2019re doing that very cautiously with what we want to do with great quality. And so I continue to believe that in the arc of time here, China is a huge opportunity for Apple and I don\u2019t get discouraged over a 90-day cycle that can have economic factors and other things in it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Ben Reitzes - Barclays Capital</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thanks Ben. Can we have the next question please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">From Piper Jaffray, we will hear from Gene Munster.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Good afternoon. You talked about more affordable pricing and Peter, can you just confirm that, that was just with the iPhone 4 and then separately as you think about the growth that you had in some of these emerging markets, it sounds like some more recently it has come from affordable pricing, but also you potentially could address those markets in products that are more appropriate for those markets? And maybe can you just talk from a very high level just how you think about, are those both levers that you potentially could use or do you feel that pricing is the lever? And then a follow-up question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Gene, it\u2019s Tim. The reference that Peter made earlier was to the iPhone 4 and what we have seen is that the number of first-time smartphone buyers that the iPhone 4 is attracting is very, very impressive. And we want to attract as many of these buyers as we can. And we saw that beginning to happen towards the end of the Q2 timeframe as I have referenced on last quarter\u2019s call and we did that on a wider spread basis offered the more affordable pricing on a wider scale basis this quarter and continued to be very happy with what we saw and where iPhone 5 continues to be the most popular iPhone by far, we are really happy to provide an incredible high-quality product with iPhone 4 running iOS 6 to as many first-time smartphone buyers as we can. And I think it\u2019s proven to be exactly a great product for that buyer.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Do you think there are more weapons that you could use in these markets to continue the pace that you have?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">There is always more weapons. And we have more than one tool in the toolbox, but yes, it\u2019s a great way for a buyer to get into the iOS ecosystem and the customer set ratings that we have with iOS 6 and the stickiness of the platform is huge. And so it\u2019s great for customers and we are very glad to offer it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. And then my final question is just in terms of the growth question that some investors have about how you keep such a higher revenue growth number moving, last quarter you referred to new products emerging and this time you referred to more products over the next few years. Are there product categories out there that are big enough to move the needle for Apple?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">We will see, Gene. We are working on some stuff that we are really proud of and we will see how it does, and we will announce things when we are ready.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thanks Gene.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thank you. Can we have the next question please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">From Cross Research we will go to Shannon Cross.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Shannon Cross - Cross Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thank you. Tim, can you talk broadly about your discussions with both existing and potential carrier partners, I would think that 56% growth in Japan might prod one in particular to be interested in some of the coming product? And then also there has been some comments about Russia and just concerns in general about pricing in that, so how sort of in general have your discussions with your carrier partners been?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I would classify them as being good. The processing on Russia probably needs some color. The articles I have seen suggested that we are not selling iPhone through carrier owned stores. If that\u2019s the one that you are referencing if you look at the Russian market, over 80% of smartphones are sold in retail. They are outside of carrier-owned stores and we sell through a number of national chains there, and in fact, our activations in Russia for iPhones were set of record last quarter, is our highest quarter in Russia ever. And so we are really happy with now we\u2019re doing there. We do continue to sell through some carrier on stores as well but obviously the contribution is much less than the retail organizations and so forth and so I think that's probably not well understood there. We\u2019re continually looking for other relationships to both add and enhance the once we have got and I do think there are some opportunities there for us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Shannon Cross - Cross Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay great and then can you talk a bit about commodities just in terms of pricing of some of your key commodity\u2019s ability to procure them and how some of, I guess your supply chain is working these days.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">We certainly have no problem procuring. In terms of where we see pricing headed and this would have been factored into the most fortune guys (ph) appear a bit earlier. Despite the very, very weak PC market DRAM pricing has actually increased and we see continued upper pressure in this area.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">NAND pricing is fairly stable and it's following seasonal trends as we would expect, both LCDs and HDDs have, the prices have fallen and we would expect further reductions in these areas and if you look at other commodities they appear to be in supply for an imbalance and so we would expect the pricing to decline on these sort of historical levels.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Thanks Shannon. Can we have the next question please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">From UBS, we will go to Steve Milunovich.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Steve Milunovich - UBS Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Thank you. Peter first could you clarify whether in your fiscal fourth quarter guidance you have any of these new products assume shipping in the quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Steve that\u2019s nothing something that I can comment on.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Steve Milunovich - UBS Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay and then Tim kind of a philosophical question, but whenever you talk about what\u2019s important in the company it always comes back to great products, better, be more important than more, Wall-Street is kind of in the more business. So I just wonder kind of talk about your philosophy and if you can come up with a couple of really great products maybe they will provide enough growth, maybe they don\u2019t but you don\u2019t seem as focused on kind of financial metrics and growth projections as a lot of companies are. Maybe tie (ph) that a little bit in your functional organizations, does that limit how many products you can actually take to market overtime?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Steve I think about it as differently than that, the way I think about is, we\u2019re here to make great products and we think that if we focus on that and do that really, really well that the financial metrics will also come and so we don\u2019t see those two things being mutually exclusive. We see them having great overlap and I think if you look at how the company has executed over many years you would suggest that that\u2019s possible.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Steve Milunovich - UBS Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">But you don\u2019t go into saying we need to X% percent growth, what do we need to do from a product. It sounds like you go the opposite, what are some really great products we can do and if we do that, the metric will take care of itself.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We started the product because we believe that the most important saying is that our customers love the products and want them, if you don\u2019t start at that level you can wind up creating things that people don\u2019t want. So we try very hard to focus on products and customers, enriching customers and making great products.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Thank you Steve. Can we have the next question please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And we will go to Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Just to Bill\u2019s earlier question, Bill Shope\u2019s on you don\u2019t think the high-end is saturated and yet ASPs have come down quite a bit of iPhone\u2019s. I was wondering if you could philosophically is the current mix what we should be thinking about for iPhone\u2019s and more specifically would you anticipate that ASPs would continue to trend lower in iPhone\u2019s or stay where they are at least directionally?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Keith in terms, we don\u2019t project ASPs, we do give guidance and we have an assumption of the ASP for the current quarter in our guidance obviously to come up with the numbers that Peter talked about earlier. If you look underneath the iPhone numbers, I think Peter alluded to earlier, we saw significant growth clearly in the lower price point year-over-year which for us is iPhone 4, it's still a great product. And that was one of the things and the iPhone 5 doing well that allows us to significantly beat what I think is probably the vast majority of expectations out there for iPhone sales. And so I don\u2019t think we do a lot better at the low end and where we sell more of those in the mix change that it has changed across the last year. If you look at 3GS last year, which was in a comparable position as our entry product, we are selling a lot more 4s and 3GSs, I think we both understand the market much better and have our things on the pulse of distribution in different countries and so forth this year. I am sure that we will get better and better at that over time and how that will change mix, I don\u2019t know.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Typically, for us, a product has the highest mix during its initial few months of sales, and so you have a natural kind of seasonal decline over time of a product cycle that generally happens on iPhone, it generally happens on iPad, and we have seen it happen on the Mac over many years. And so I don\u2019t see anything that fundamentally would change that, but again, we are going to look at this thing quarter-by-quarter and tell you how we look at the quarter and give you guidance forward as we go.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay, alright. And then Peter for you, there has been a few comments on gross margins and I want to try to broaden out a bit. In the past as you look at the one quarter forward which would be the September quarter you have given us some of the puts and takes that think about there has been a couple of specific questions asked about, but I want to broaden out and see if you could just highlight what you think are the puts and takes in the September quarter as you see them today, particularly with reference to the quarter you just reported? Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Sure. I am going to keep my comments limited, but I will give you a put and a take.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Where I guess the tailwind we would expect our component costs to be favorable in the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Conversely, we would expect some FX pressure in the quarter given the strengthening in the dollar, particularly against the yen.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay, thanks guys.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thank you. Can we have the next question please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And from Raymond James we will hear from Tavis McCourt.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Tavis McCourt - Raymond James</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thanks for taking my question. Peter, first a clarification on the share buyback and can you tell us what the ending basic share count was in the third quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">All of that is on the income statement, so you got the ending basic and diluted, but let me give you a couple of points that I think could be helpful for you. During the June quarter, we concluded the first $2 billion ASR program that we started in December and then so we got the final shares in on those, and we did our second ASR program of $12 billion, that started at the end of April and we received 23.5 million shares initially on that. And I went through in my prepared remarks, at some point during fiscal \u201814 that program will close and we will get the final number of shares. We also bought back 4 billion of stock in the open market during the June quarter and received about 9 million shares. So, the impact of those in the June quarter lowered our diluted share count in the quarter by about 22.9 million shares. And as you look forward into the September quarter before any further buybacks or any issuance to employees we would expect to see an additional approximate 11 million share benefit from the things that occurred during the June quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Tavis McCourt - Raymond James</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Great, thanks. And one for you Tim, one of the comments out of the developers\u2019 conference was iOS, hopefully, I guess in 12 different car manufacturer models next year. I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about that opportunity whether it\u2019s a license opportunity, what\u2019s the strategic relevance of that if you are willing to? Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I am sorry I couldn\u2019t hear that question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Tavis McCourt - Raymond James</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I think at the developers conference there was a comment about iOS being built into a number of car manufacturing models for next year? I was wondering if you can talk about kind of the strategic relevance for that and what the business model might be for that for Apple?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I see it is very important. It is a part of the ecosystem, and so just like the app store is a key part of the ecosystem and iTunes and all other content are key and the services we provide from messaging to and (inaudible) support. Having something in the automobile is very, very important, it's something that people want and I think that Apple can do this in a unique way better than anyone else. So it's a key focus for us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Thank you Tavis.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Apple Incorporated Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2013 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking first today are Apple\u2019s CEO, Tim Cook; and CFO, Peter Oppenheimer and they will be joined by Vice President and Corporate Controller, Luca Maestri for Q&amp;A session with analysts.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Please note that some of the information you\u2019ll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margins, operating expenses, other income and expense, stock-based compensation expense, taxes and future products.

Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Tim Cook for introductory remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you very much for joining us. We are eager to share with you the results of the final quarter of Apple\u2019s fiscal 2013 with a strong finish to an amazing year and Peter will provide details about the September quarter shortly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">But first I\u2019m happy to tell you that Apple\u2019s business is stronger than ever. We are in a unique position of having world class hardware, software and service skills under one road, which enables us to provide an unparallel user experience to 100s of millions of customers. And working with our vibrant developer community, we\u2019ve built a large and thriving ecosystem.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We are winning with our products in all the ways that are most important to us, in customer satisfaction, in product usage and in customer loyalty. Our relentless focus on providing innovation that enhances our customer\u2019s lives is evident in extraordinary list of products that we\u2019ve launched in just the last couple of months.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">From the colorful iPhone 5c and forward thinking iPhone 5s to the powerful new iMac, MacBook Pro and Mac Pro to the stunning iPad Mini with Retina display and the dramatically thinner, lighter and more powerful iPad Air.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thanks to a deep collaboration between our design and engineering teams. We also launched iOS 7 with a stunning new redesign, powerful new features and a great new service called iTunes Radio. We introduced OS X Mavericks bringing new core technologies for breakthrough power efficiency and performance to our Mac and we introduced next generation iLife and iWork apps for iOS and OS X. And we\u2019re making all of this incredible software free because we want our customers to have access to the greatest new features. All of these are products that only Apple could have delivered and most companies would be proud to just have one of them.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Looking back, we\u2019re very pleased with Apple\u2019s many accomplishments during fiscal 2013. Our customers had an incredible response to our product line up, buying a 150 million iPhone, 71 million iPads and 16 million Macs across the fiscal year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We expanded the breadth and depth of our ecosystem and we generated over $16 billion revenue from iTunes software and services. We also welcomed almost 400 million visitors to our retail stores and opened or remodeled 49 new stores and for the second year in a row we produced over $50 million in revenue per store.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We generated record total company revenue of $171 billion, earnings of $37 billion and operating cash flow of $54 billion. We paid over $8 billion in capital expenditures to both to our supply chain, expand our infrastructure and increased our retail footprint. We also completed 15 strategic acquisitions. That\u2019s an average of one acquisition every three to four weeks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We more than doubled the size of our capital return program to a $100 billion, including the largest share repurchase authorization in history and we become one of the largest dividend payers in the world.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In fact, we returned over $36 billion to shareholders to dividend and share repurchases in the last five quarters alone. We remain firmly committed to our objective of delivering attractive returns to shareholders through both our business performance and a return of capital. We review our capital program regularly and our orders engaged in the discussion of capital allocation on an ongoing basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We have solicited feedback on our capital return program from shareholders in the past. We greatly appreciated their suggestions and we will actively seek their input again this year. As we\u2019ve in the past, the Board and the Management team will consider a wide range of issues and be thoughtful and deliberate and we will announce any changes to our current program in the first part of the new calendar year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We are off to a great start in fiscal year \u201914. We continue to be very confident in Apple\u2019s future and we see significant opportunities ahead of us and both current product categories and new ones. We are participating in large and growing markets. Today smartphone penetration of the global handset market is only a little over 50%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">The smartphone category is expected to grow significantly in the next few years from about 1 billion units per year this year to over 1.7 billion in 2017. And the tablet market is growing at an even faster way from about 225 billion units this year to over 400 million in 2017. We are continuing to invest in R&amp;D and distribution, we\u2019re expanding our geographic coverage and we\u2019re building upon a phenomenal, but still very young retail store presence.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We are also proud to be a force for good in the world beyond our products, whether its improving working conditions of the environment, standing up for human rights, helping eliminate AIDS or reinventing education, Apple is making substantial contributions to society.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">I would like to thank all of our customers and our long-term shareholders for their loyalty and I\u2019d also like to thank Apple\u2019s many talented employees who have worked tirelessly to bring us this far and who are passionately focused on making great products that enrich people\u2019s lives.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">I\u2019d now turn the call over to Peter to discuss the details of the most recent quarter. Peter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Thank you, Tim.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We are pleased to report the results of the final quarter of Apple\u2019s fiscal year \u201913 with record four quarter iPhone sales, driving our highest September quarter revenue ever.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Revenue for the quarter was $37.5 billion, up $1.5 billion or 4% from the year-ago quarter, and slightly above the high end of the guidance range. Gross margin was 37% at the high end of our guidance range, and operating margin was $10 billion, representing 26.8% of revenue. Net income was $7.5 billion translating to diluted earnings per share of $8.26.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">As for the details of the quarter, I would like to begin with iPhone. We sold 33.8 million iPhones compared to 26.9 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 6.9 million or 26% and a new September quarter record. iPhone sales were ahead of our expectations and grew stronger year-over-year in each of our geographic segments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We were particularly pleased with growth in a number of developing markets with unit sales up sharply year-over-year in Latin America, the Middle East, Russia and India. We were also very happy to add NTT Docomo to our carrier line up in Japan, a country where demand to iPhone has been especially strong.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">iPhone sales remain very robust in the U.S with comScore estimating that Apple was the leading smartphone manufacture with a 40.7% smartphone subscribership for the three months ending in August. And among North American customers polled by ChangeWave late last month, we plan to purchase the smartphone with a 90 days, 63% indicated they plan to purchase an iPhone.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We exited the quarter with about 14.3 million total iPhones in channel inventory, which represented a sequential increase of 3.3 million from the June quarter and placed us at the low end of our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPhone channel inventory on a look forward basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Customers are loving their iPhones. Based on the most recently published research, ChangeWave measured a 96% customer satisfaction rate among iPhone users and Kantar measured a 92% customer loyalty rate, significantly higher than the competition. And we believe that a great customer experience translates to much higher usage. In fact, Experian reported that iPhone users spend an average of 53% more time each day on their phone than android phone users.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">iPhone continues to be a key productivity tool for organizations around the world aided by apps from the app store as well as those custom built for internal use. In fact, nearly 35,000 companies representing millions of employees worldwide are building custom apps that address specific workflow improvements with their iPhones and iPad users.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In the U.S., over 14,000 employees of Johnson Controls are using iPhones for work. The company has created in-house apps that have enhanced field technician service delivery and customer communications. In China, AVIC International, a unit of Aviation Industry Corporation of China has equipped 27,000 employees with iPhones to access internally developed apps for office, administrative documentation, approval processes in key business intelligent systems.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to iPad, we sold 14.1 million iPads during the quarter compared to 14 million in the year-ago quarter. iPad sales exceeded our expectations in the September quarter as we approach our new product introductions. We experienced robust year-over-year sales growth in Japan, Russia, the Middle East and we were pleased with strong back-to-school demand for iPad in the U.S. and Canada. iPad sell-through was roughly equal to sell-in, so we exited the quarter with about 4.1 million units of iPad channel inventory within our target range of four to six weeks on a look-back basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Interest in iPad remains incredibly strong. In an August survey by ChangeWave, consumers who intend to purchase tablets within 90 days, 55% indicated they find the purchase of iPads more than four times the rate of the next most popular alternative. And of those who already own iPads, the survey measured a 99% customer satisfaction rate. The momentum of iOS devices in enterprise also remains incredibly strong.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In its latest Mobility Index Report, Good Technology indicated that the iOS platform accounted for 95% of enterprise mobile app activations and 72% of all mobile device activations in the September quarter while iPad accounted for 90% of total tablet activations. Companies around the world are using iPads with custom apps to reinvent their legacy business processes; improving efficiencies across organizations and job sections.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">For example, direct store delivery reps at Dr Pepper Snapple Group uses iPads to facilitate communications and streamline the product delivery process. East Japan Railway personnel use iPad Minis to stay informed about schedule changes and access conductor manual. And Swedish manufacturer SKS uses a custom iPad app to calculate the life of their ball bearing products saving 10 to 15 minutes per calculation for every engineer several times per day.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Schools around the world continue to adopt iPad to transform teaching and learning in the classroom. In the U.K. the number of iPads sold to K-12 schools has more than doubled year-over-year and in Latin America; over 70,000 iPads are being used by systemic learner students [ph] across 800 schools to improve their learning experience.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Here in the U.S., school districts continue to rollout large iPad initiatives to students. The Coachella Valley School District in California is currently distributing over 19,000 iPads to its entire student body. In South Carolina every one of the Horry County School District's 10,000 middle school students will receive an iPad this year. These broad deployments are in part driven by the great educational content available on iPad and we're pleased to report that iBooks textbooks are now available across the U.S., U.K. and Australian national high school curricula.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Last week we were thrilled to introduce new iPads featuring the A7 chip with 64-bit desktop-class architecture, ultrafast wireless and expanded LTE connectivity. The new iPad Air features a beautiful retina display in an elegant unit body design that is 20% thinner and 28% lighter than the fourth generation iPad and the iPad Mini with retina display packs all the pixels of the iPad Air into its stunning 7.9 inch display and runs over 475,000 iPad apps available in the app store.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to Mac, sales with 4.6 million Macs were above our expectations, which is a 7% decline from the year-ago quarter. IDC estimates that the global personal computer market contracted by 10% during the September quarter indicating that Macs continues to gain share just as they have with 29 of the last 30 quarters. We were especially pleased with strong year-over-year growth in sales of MacBook Air which we updated in June. In late September we updated iMac with fourth generation Intel quad-core processors, new graphics, next generation Wi-Fi and faster PCIe flash storage options.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Last week we launched new versions of MacBook Pro with retina display featuring fourth generation Intel core processors, faster graphics, long rate battery life and a more affordable price. Also last week we launched Mavericks, the 10th major release of OS X with more than 200 new features. Mavericks brings iBooks and Maps to the Mac, includes the new version Safari, enhances multi-display support, introduces Finder Tabs and Tags and delivers core technologies for breakthrough power efficiency and performance and is now free. We ended the quarter with Mac channel inventory that was just below our four to five week target range.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We continue to be very pleased with the growth of iTunes software and services in the strength of the Apple ecosystem. Our iTunes Stores generated record billings of $4.4 billion in the September quarter thanks to continued strong growth in sales of apps. The quarter's iTunes billings translated quarterly iTunes revenue $2.4 billion, up 15% from the year-ago quarter. The strong iTunes sales combined with other software and service revenue resulted in total quarterly revenue 4.3 billion from iTunes software and services, an increase of 22% year-over-year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Cumulative app downloads have reached 60 billion and our app developers have now earned 13 billion from sales to the App Store, half of which they've earned in the last year. We had a tremendously successful launch of iOS 7 last month with hundreds of millions of downloads in the first few days alone, making it the fastest software upgrade ever. Last week we reported nearly two-thirds of iOS devices were already running iOS 7; that's significantly higher than the percentage of users running the latest versions of other mobile operating systems. This rapid transition to the latest version of iOS not only means that more customers are having the most advanced experience possible but it also enables developers to offer their latest app innovations to hundreds of billions of users in a single software release.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">iOS offers something now for everyone with its great new design and features such as control center, AirDrop and iTunes Radio. In fact the number of unique listeners who have tried iTunes Radio is now 20 million and growing. iOS 7 also includes significant features that make iPhones and iPads more secure in users to manage in corporate environments, offering new ways to configure and deploy devices at scale.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">New device management capabilities include control sharing of documents and attachments, App Store license management, wireless managed app setup and streamline mobile device management and enrollment. In terms of security, iOS 7 offers enterprise single sign-on, default third party app data protection and per app VPNs automatically connect stored corporate apps to the network without the need for users to change complicated settings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">I'd now like to turn to the Apple retail stores. The revenue for the quarter was 4.5 billion, up 6% from the year-ago quarter. The stores produced very strong iPhone sales with unit growth of 36% per store per week compared to the September quarter last year. W completed the remodels of two stores and opened eight new stores during the quarter ending with a total of 416 stores including 162 outside the United States. We are projecting a total of approximately 30 new store openings in fiscal year '14, about two-thirds of which will be outside U.S.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We also plan to remodel about 20 stores over the course of fiscal year '14. With an average of 411 stores opened in the September quarter, average revenue per store was 10.9 million compared to 11.2 million in the year-ago quarter. Retail segment income was 709 million. We hosted 99 million visitors to stores during the quarter which translates to 18,500 visitors per store per week. Operating expenses were 3.8 billion and included 467 million in stock-based compensation expense. OI&amp;E was 113 million and the tax rate for the quarter was 25.9%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Turning to our cash, we ended the quarter with 146.8 billion in cash plus short term and long term marketable securities, a sequential increase of $100 million from the June quarter. Our domestic cash was 35.5 billion at the end of the September quarter, a sequential decline of 5.2 billion largely attributable to our share repurchase activity. $111.3 billion or 76% of our total cash was offshore at the end of the September quarter, and cash flow from operations was $9.9 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We paid $2.8 billion in dividends in the quarter and we executed an additional $5 billion in repurchases up 10.4 million shares of Apple stock during the quarter. This brings us to a cumulative total of $36 billion in payments for dividends and share repurchases over the last five quarters of which share buybacks were $23 billion. This has resulted in cumulative retirement of almost 47 million shares and represents 5% of the total shares outstanding prior to the launch of our repurchase program. More than 44 million of these shares have been retired in the past two quarters alone.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Finally given that our capital return program must be funded from domestic cash, and as a result of our payments to date, the cash that we can net domestically and return to shareholders to stop accumulating. In fact we give return to shareholders who invested essentially all of the increase in available net cash generated since the beginning of our capital return program in 2012. Our Board of Directors has declared a dividend of $3.05 for common share payable on November 14, 2013 to shareholders of record as in the close of this on November 11, 2013.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Now, as we move ahead into the December quarter, I would like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to in the beginning of the call. First, I was to explain a bit about revenue deferrals. We believe that our software and services play a tremendous role in delivering an overall experience that our customers have come to know and love. Over the last few years we have added significantly to the offering that we provide our customers a no incremental charge from operating system upgrade rights to non-software services such as Siri and iCloud.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So, iLife and iWork has become as essential for the user experience as mail, messages and calendar. So we\u2019re now making iPhoto, iMovie, Pages, Numbers and Keynotes available as free downloads to customers who purchase new iOS devices and we\u2019re also making Mavericks and future OS X upgrades as well as iLife and iWork free to our Mac customers. As a result of the traditional rights and features we are deferring a greater portion of the sale of each iOS device in Mac sold. We anticipate that the additional deferral per device sold coupled with our sequentially greater unit volume expectations in the December quarter will result in about a $900 million sequential increase in the net amount of revenue deferred for software upgrade rights and non-software services.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">In total we expect revenue to be between $55 billion and $58 billion compared to $54.5 billion in the year ago quarter. We expect gross margins to be between 36.5% and 37.5% reflecting approximately a $105 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be between $4.4 billion and $4.5 billion including about $585 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OI&amp;E to be about $200 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 26.25%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">In closing, we are very pleased with the results of the final quarter of our fiscal year \u201913. We enter fiscal year \u201914 with an incredible lineup of products including our amazing new iPhones and iPads. We remain committed to delivering great innovative products and services that delight our customers and enhance their lives, and we\u2019re very confident in our new product pipelines.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">With that, I\u2019d like to open the call to questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Thank you, Peter. And we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Operator, may we have the first question please?</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p6\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">(Operator Instructions) First we\u2019ll go to Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Katy Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Thanks. Peter, I\u2019m a little surprised your December quarter gross margin guidance isn\u2019t even better given the increased total iPhone mix and also iPhone 5s within the iPhone line. I imagine there\u2019s a lot of offsetting factors given the products that were launched last week. So, I just wonder if you can walk through some of the gross margin headwinds that you see in the December quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Sure. We expect, as I said in my prepared remarks our gross margins to be between 36.5% and 37.5%. So, essentially inline with the September quarter we\u2019re pleased to be guiding gross margin about flat sequentially given all the new products that we have launched in the last few weeks. During the quarter we expect gross margin to benefit from the leverage on the substantial sequential increase in revenue. Offsetting these benefits we see a few factors including the higher deferred revenue relating to the software that I talked about in my prepared remarks. And as I said we expect the sequential increase in our deferral which is not only revenue but affects margin as well to be $900 million. Second, a richer mix of new iPad\u2019s with higher cost structures and lower pricing. Third, FX headwinds primarily from the Yen and fourth, the new lower priced MacBook Pro and iMac which have higher cost structures and credit structures. So those are four things that I would point out Katy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Katy Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay, very helpful. Tim, the press and even some of your competitors are quite complementary of the innovation in iPhone 5s. But it seems like investors are looking or glancing over the 64-bit ARM processor, the fingerprint sensor, the M7 processor and part of this is that they\u2019re not exactly sure what those technologies enable, i.e. why do you need a 64-bit ARM processor in a phone. So, just hoping you could enlighten us a little bit on that question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Well, I think everything that you mentioned Katy is the front end of a long road map and so we have the first 64-bit smarphone as you mentioned and this is our first use of the fingerprint sensor and if you\u2019ve used it thus far you know that it's pretty profound to -- use it from a security point of view and use it also to purchase apps or music or movies et cetera. And so, both of these I think are the most important person here obviously is what our customers think and these new innovations on the 5s and the 5c combined led us to have our best iPhone launch ever with selling about nine million units through the weekend. So it was -- we\u2019re off to a great start.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Thank you, Katy. Can we have the next question please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">We\u2019ll go to Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay, great, thanks. Looking at the iPhone business as well, for the 5c there was some anticipation that the price point would be lower and there was obviously some debate around that when you launched it. Now that you had the device out there for a while, a few weeks; what type of response are you seeing from the most cost sensitive regions and can you remind us of some of the things you are doing to make the products increasingly affordable for the emerging regions in particular?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Bill, its Tim. If you look at what we\u2019ve done with our iPhone line, we\u2019re selling the iPhone 4s as our entry offer. We\u2019re selling the iPhone 5c as sort of a mid-tier offer and then of course the iPhone 5s. And our goal is to overall have growth worth for total iPhone, but also within that we want to have each of those categories grow as compared to the -- what we were doing previously. And so, if you take look at the total offers that we\u2019re making and low-end space and mid-tier and high-end, the sum of all the price points we offer there we\u2019d like to grow in each one of those and we\u2019re really pleased that we did that, and so that\u2019s how we measure partly measure success, because the most important thing for us is to make a great product, but we do need growth and we\u2019re happy that we\u2019ve seen that. I realize that some people were reading rumors about that the entry phone would be the 5c, but that was never our intent obviously. Our entry iPhone is the iPhone 4s and as you know from comments that I\u2019ve made previously we were selling the iPhone 4 in very good volumes and as we began to experiment in different regions at somewhat lower price points we saw a fair amount of price elasticity and so we\u2019re hoping and thinking that, that will continue with the 4s.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. And then related to that somewhat looking at the iPhone ASP\u2019s overall, last quarter you reminded us that the iPhone ASP and mix tends to be at its highest levels in the first few months of a product cycle and then tends to trend downward throughout the product cycle. Do you think we should assume similar patterns hold for this cycle or there is some unique factors we should consider particularly given the change in the product line?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">All things being equal what we would normally see on our products is that you have a large number of people that are early adopter related that come into the market right after we announced and buy our very best product. So other things being equal that's what we would expect to see.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay, great. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Thanks, Bill. Can we have the next question please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Next, we'll go to Tony Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Antonio Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Yes. Thank you. Tim, you commented in your initial remarks about new product categories. I think this was also something you were explicit about in your April quarterly conference call where you said that consumers and investors should expect new products, including new product categories in the second half of this year and first half of 2014. So can you reiterate that we should have that expectation? And when you talk about new product categories, I presume that since you made the statement in April, there have been none? I just want to make sure I understand the semantics of what you referred to as a new category?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Tony, I didn't say in April that you would see them in this year and the first half of next year just to be clear on that. But what I have said is \u2013 I have said that you would see some exciting new products from us in the fall of this year and across 2014. And I obviously stand by that and you've seen a lot of things over the last couple of months. In terms of new product categories, specifically if you look at the skills that Apple has from hardware, software and services and at incredible app ecosystems, these set of things are very, very unique. I think no one has a set of skills like us and we obviously believe that we can use our skills in building other great products that are in categories that represent areas where we do not participate today. So we're pretty confident about that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Antonio Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. As a follow-up I wanted to revisit the question your pricing strategy. Last quarter you spoke very buoyantly about elasticity that you experienced on the iPhone 4 and you had lowered the price in many emerging markets to about $400. Yet when the new products came out, the 4s was actually at a notably higher price than the 4 had been the previous quarter. The 5c was obviously in line with what we had seen before with the 4s and 5s was in line with the 5. So if anything one of the common themes that came out on last earnings call was the desire to embrace the elasticity of the iPhone, but as best I can tell price points across the board seem to be a little bit higher than they were three months ago despite the significant success you had there. So I'm wondering how we should think about what lessons you learned from the 4 pricing changes, why you didn't choose to keep the 4 given that it was an extraordinary strong seller as best we could tell last quarter and how you proceed \u2013 how you expect to try and continue to address the lower priced segments of the smartphone market?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Tony, the 400 number just to clarify your number not mine, what we did with our lineup this time was the 4s is replacing the 4 and so if you look at the U.S. as an example, the 4s is now 3, the 4 previously was 3. When you translate that out of the U.S., it depends on the market as to what specifically is happening. As you know currency changes and the strength of the dollar doesn't play in our favor in some geos from that perspective. But generally we see the 4s as our entry iPhone offer that gives somebody the ability to access the entire ecosystem with a fantastic product. And we clearly understand that there is elasticity in that market and we'll move accordingly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thank you, Tony. Can we have the next question please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">We'll hear from Ben Reitzes with Barclays.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Ben Reitzes - Barclays Capital</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hi. Thanks a lot. First question is on China. Tim, congrats on being I think the only company in my sector that grew in China this quarter. I'd have to check that but got to be one of them. You returned to growth I believe at 6%, if my math is right. What happened and do you see that growth rate accelerating? We're hoping you have new partnerships there and how can you expand distribution?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yes. Ben we had a pretty good quarter in China. We obviously want to do better. But if you look at the quarter, we did grow by 6%. Underneath that, iPhone units were up 25% year-over-year despite significant constraints on iPhone 5s that affected the whole company [ph]. However, we were able to launch in our first round this time in China and that was a big change in the result of a close work relationship with the carriers in China and the government. And so we feel really good about that. We are able to do that on the iPad as well as we announced last week. For the full year, the Greater China region generated over $27 billion in sales for us, up 14% year-over-year. So we have a reasonable sized business there. In the year-ago quarter, iPad launched. It launched late in China and so that pressure, the 6% down some otherwise it would have been I think even a stronger quarter given the strength of iPhone. So we are continuing to invest in stores. We opened one additional store in Greater China in the last few weeks. We're investing in indirect distribution. Our point-of-sales are up by about 50% year-over-year on the iPhone and we're continuing to go out to more cities. Initially we were very focused on just the large cities and so we're working on both coverage on launching earlier and execution and continuing to build on our retail practice there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Ben Reitzes - Barclays Capital</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. And I guess nothing to announce more but my second question is for Peter. There's some confusion around the revenue deferral and I was just hoping you could clarify it for gross margins. The $900 million is about \u2013 I don't know I guess 160 basis points if I have that right on gross margins. How much of that should we say is pressuring gross margin down in your guidance? I mean do we take about \u2013 would your gross margin guidance had been about half the difference there higher if it weren't for this revenue deferral? And then when do we recoup that margin? How many quarters does it take to recoup and how will that flow back to the model? Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Sure, Ben. We have been defying revenues for the sale of each iOS device and Mac given that we have been providing updates to software. Given the announcements that we made last week and that I went through it in my prepared remarks, we have actually increased those deferrals. iPhone and iPad, we are differing between $15 and $25. That's up as much as $5 per device and Mac has been some $20 to $40, so up an additional $20. On a sequential basis, given the increased deferral rates that we have as a result of increase in the software that we are providing to customers for free coupled with our sequential unit increases, we will defer we think about $900 million more in revenue in the December quarter than we deferred in the September quarter. So you can calculate the impact to gross margin on that. We will also and that goes straight through the margin, its revenue and a dollar-for-dollar reduction in gross margin. We will then record that revenue that we\u2019ve deferred for iOS devices across a two year period of time ratably and for Max over a four year period of time. So, Ben just to summarize, we happen to frame revenue on both iOS devices and Max for a number of years given the software that we have been giving away for free. We have increased those rates beginning in September for the iOS devices and in October for the Max, and it will come back into those products over two and four years as I said.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Ben Reitzes - Barclays Capital</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Great, thanks. That\u2019s a pretty good guide for gross margin if you take that out -- if you\u2019re leaving that out. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Ben, I\u2019d just add on to that, thank you for saying it and I agree; and I would also say that we\u2019re really happy to be guiding gross margin flat not only because of the deferral but in addition to all of the new products that we\u2019ve introduced with higher cost structures and lower prices and we\u2019ll -- no hard and fast commitments, but we\u2019re going to work really hard to get down the cost curves as we have successfully in the past.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Ben Reitzes - Barclays Capital</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thanks, Ben. Can we have the next question please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">From Piper Jaffray, we\u2019ll go to Gene Munster.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Hey, good afternoon and just to make sure this is crystal clear here on the gross margin. It would have been about 38.5% would have been the mid point of the guide excluding the change to deferral, is that correct Peter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Probably in that range, Gene. I didn\u2019t do it precisely, but you can take the $900 million that we\u2019re deferring across the revenue range as we did the math.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay, great. And then beyond the December quarter in terms of structural elements around the iPhone gross margin, a couple of years ago with the 4s we saw the launch and then we saw the margins ramp kind of nicely after the launch. I know you\u2019re not giving guidance beyond the December quarter, but are there some structural things that have changed the profitability of the iPhone it would be good to know as we think about our models in 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s any structural difference\u2019s, but I\u2019ll make a couple of comments and I\u2019m not giving guidance beyond the December quarter but just a couple of things to think about. We\u2019re benefiting this quarter as I talked about in answering Katy\u2019s question from the benefits of leverage given the very big sequential increase in revenue. Leverage cut both ways, so presumably that would go against us in the March quarter. However we would expect to defer less for the software deferrals in the March quarter as well. And as I noted at the end of Ben\u2019s question, we will endeavor to work very hard to get down cost curves as we have in the past, no change.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. And then my follow-up question, in terms of the iPad and the Mini price change I guess just broader thinking around the iPad we\u2019ve seen some fluctuations in the growth rate. How do you think about that segment in terms of growing at or above or below market growth rates around tablets? And separately is there any differences in terms of how often people are upgrading their iPad\u2019s versus the iPhone\u2019s, it feels like they\u2019re upgrading them every three years versus a little bit over every two years for the iPhone, is that accurate. So, the size of the opportunity and then maybe just any sort of nuances and the upgrade behaviors between the iPhone and the iPad.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Gene, its Tim. We continue to view the tablet market as huge. We see it as a large opportunity for us. We are not solely focused on unit share as I\u2019ve said many times, but we\u2019re focused on usage in customer\u2019s side, the loyalty and other things that are very important to us. We do believe that this has been or the announcement last week was our largest iPad announcement ever and we\u2019re confident we\u2019re going to grow year-over-year, and if you look back we had a very, very strong quarter a year ago. We get off to a great start this weekend with iPad Air. And then later in the months we\u2019ll begin shipping the new Mini. We do feel that we wanted to reduce the price of the iPad Mini and so we did that and now we\u2019re coming in at $299 which is an incredible value to get access to the whole of the ecosystem and so forth. And iPad Air is just, it's absolutely incredible product, the best iPad we have ever done. And so, I think all of these are \u2013 [ph] thus these products are going to do really well. I think it\u2019s going to be an iPad Christmas and -- but we will see, we will report the numbers back to you in January how we did, but we are pretty confident.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Thanks, Gene. Could we have the next question please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">From Cross Research, we will go to Shannon Cross.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Shannon Cross - Cross Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Thank you very much. Tim, can you talk a bit more about your decision to offer the Mac OS for free and provide iWork and iLife with new device purchases? How are you thinking about it vis-\u00e0-vis some of the competition?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Our primary reason for doing it Shannon was that we wanted it to become a part of what it meant to own a Mac and what it meant to own an iOS device. We saw iWork had become the best selling productivity app on a mobile device. We wanted all of our customers to have access to our very latest software, so they would have access to our best features. And so we decided to make the bold move of making it free and I know some other folks charge a $199 or so for each of these actually for the OS and the productivity apps. But we really wanted to make it a part of the experience and so we are making it free and we are going back all the way to Snow Leopard on the OS side and iWork is free for all new Macs and so I think it\u2019s a very strong offer, I think it\u2019s just another reason that everyone should buy Mac and we think it was great decision to do so, but most importantly we think it\u2019s great for customers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Shannon Cross - Cross Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Great. And then -- I just had a question on education which somewhat ties into this since iWork and iLife I think are some of these operating systems run through that, I\u2019m curious with the -- what your thoughts are with regard to Chromebook Google apps, any kind of foothold that we are seeing with Google taking share in education because as we\u2019ve seen some of the price points for the devices are pretty low, but clearly you guys are able to sell into education as well. So I\u2019m kind of curious as to how you view the competition and how you position your products vis-\u00e0-vis some of the things that are fairly low priced?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">It\u2019s a good question. We had our best education quarter ever. We went over a $1 billion in revenues for the first time ever. We were up strongly year-over-year up 8%. iPad was up 22% year-over-year and the Mac was up 8% and as you know the PC market was down 10% in the aggregate and likely down even more in education. And so we feel like we\u2019re doing great on both fronts, both in the iPad space and in the Mac space for people wanting to buy Mac. And we do see Chromebook\u2019s in some places, but the vast majority of people are buying PC/Mac or an iPad. Our share of tablet in education is 94%. I mean it\u2019s -- yeah, it\u2019s sort of unheard of. I have never seen a market share that high before. So we feel like we are doing really well here and are great to be making -- feel great to be making a contribution to education.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Shannon Cross - Cross Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thank you, Shannon. The next question please.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Next from UBS, we will go to Steve Milunovich.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Steve Milunovich - UBS Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thanks. Could you talk a little bit about the supply side? There has been some thoughts that the fingerprint technology has been a little bit hard to manufacture and you indicated that the Retina mini would be out later in November. So kind of curious, if you\u2019re going to be able to lead the demand for the holidays with the mini that you would like to or may be some general supply comments and also comments on component cost.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Sure. Steve it\u2019s Tim. In terms of supply, iPhone 5s into the quarter with a very significant backlog. We are still -- we still have a significant backlog. However, our supply is building each week and we\u2019re -- we\u2019ve been -- and we\u2019re very confident of our ability to keep ramping and so we rolled out 30 more countries with the iPhone 5s and 5c as of last Friday and we'll roll out another 16 this week. And so we're right on where we would like to be in terms of achieving 100 countries by the end of the calendar year. In terms of the retina or the iPad Mini with the retina display, we'll start shipping later in November. It's unclear whether we will have enough for the quarter or not. We now have mini \u2013 we will have but you really don't know the demand until after you start shipping and so we'll see how that goes. But I think we'll do fairly well with iPad as I had mentioned before. We felt like it's going to be a really great holiday season. On terms of component cost, both DRAM and NAND were up last quarter from the previous quarter. DRAM we believe will continue to be up in this quarter. We think NAND will be flat and other commodities will fall sequentially.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Steve Milunovich - UBS Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. And then Peter, about a year ago you indicated that the December quarter would benefit by about 200 basis points in gross margin due to a combination of mix shift toward phones and higher volume. Is that the sort of uplift you would expect from those factories this December quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Steve, I don't want to put a precise amount on it but we \u2013 I see us benefiting from a couple of things in the quarter; the leverage on the higher revenue by far being the biggest. As Tim mentioned, we expect to have a positive commodity environment and selling iPhones is never a bad thing from the margin perspective.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Steve Milunovich - UBS Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Thank you, Steve. Can we have the next question please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">We'll go to Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Mark Moskowitz - JPMorgan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes. Thanks. Good afternoon. The first question for Tim just regarding the channel inventory levels of 14.3 million for the iPhone, much higher than we've seen in the quarters past. Is there similar sort of message there in terms of you not having much broader coverage in terms of incremental coverage or is there a much bigger incremental upgrade cycle from your installed base or both?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I think the way \u2013 the number one thing to know on the channel inventory is that our range as you know for iPhone is four to six weeks and we were at the low end of our range. And so that to me is the most \u2013 that's the most important thing I look at anyway I should say. You can choose to look at the thing that's most important to you. In terms of a changing from where it's been in the past, the things that you should consider are the \u2013 China was in wave one this year, so there was a lot more point-of-sales there. We added DOCOMO in Japan. And so that's a large carrier to add. And what probably were not in the opening comments was that of the 14 million, 1.8 million of those were iPhones that were in transit and therefore not available to sale in the channel. And we always count those in channel inventory because they are in our sales line. And so that's how I look at the iPhone inventory.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Mark Moskowitz - JPMorgan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. And then just a follow-up, if I could. A year ago you had a very ambitious multi-product ramp in terms of new products coming out. At the same time you did have some impacts related to supply constraints. Just to kind of follow up on Steve's question. Do you feel that four months later, fast forward to the future now that you're in a much better shape to kind of avert or navigate some of these big supply constraints that inflicted some problems on you last year or can we see a similar situation as we move to the quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">As I mentioned on the iPhone 5s I feel like we're doing really well on supply. The demand is very robust. And so we are in backlog right now. But I feel confident about us continuing to ramp and do quite well for the quarter. On the iPad Mini we'll start shipping later this month and it's very difficult to forecast exactly when supply and demand will balance there. We'll also see about the iPad Air as we go out this week. I think we'll have a really good weekend. It may be that not everyone can find what they want more [ph]. I think versus last year I think one key difference is we announced one of our key Macs, the iMac but we didn't begin shipping until the end of December. And so we went for more than two months with minimal iMac sales and therefore from a Mac point of view year-over-year last year, we had \u2013 our only down a quarter, down versus the market that is in the last 30 quarters. And so I don't envision that happening this year. I feel really good about the way the MacBook Pros have gotten off last week. They've gotten off to a huge start. I feel great about Mac growing year-over-year this quarter. I feel great about iPad growing year-over-year this quarter as well. You can tell that from the strong guidance numbers that Peter gave earlier.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Thank you, Mark. Can we have the next question please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">We'll go to Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Thanks very much. I wanted to ask about iPhone ASPs. They were down about 7% year-on-year in the quarter and down sequentially. Last year they were up sequentially on the launch. Was that a product supply availability issue? And how do you think about ASPs going forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Chris, it's Peter. Sequentially we were relatively flat, so I'll comment on a year-over-year basis. They were down 7% as you indicated and this was primarily due to a significant increase in the sales of our entry SKUs where we had made them more affordable to attract more first-time smart buyers. We've also encouraged some FX headwinds from the yen, the Australian dollar and a number of the emerging markets which impacted us as well. I don't want to forecast ASPs for the December quarter. We'll report to you in January what they were. But the FX headwinds will likely continue given where exchange rates are today.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And just to follow-up on Mark's earlier question around channel inventories, that 14 million unit number was I think higher than a lot of people expected. Was that also SKU-ed [ph] towards the low end of the product stack given the 5s was short exiting the quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">The 5s was in huge backlog and so any kind of 5s that was in the channel was a transitionary kind of move \u2013 maybe perhaps in transit and so forth. We did have as I mentioned before, we had 1.8 million units of total iPhone units in transit at the end of the quarter. So that's a pretty substantial number.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And just lastly I wanted to ask about subsidies. That wasn't mentioned as a potential impact to phone margins but can you comment on carrier subsidies more generally? How sustainable are they given the competitive environment and how are carriers responding to the pricing stack of your phone line? Thanks a lot.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I think carriers like to sell as many units as they can and get as many people in their service. And in most regions walk into the un-serviced contracts and so they're very predictable and reliable and I don't really see that changing. I think the carriers have come up with some different or some carriers have come up with different sales programs that might appeal to someone who wants to upgrade their phone annually instead of every other year. I think those programs in general probably reduce the subsidy somewhat in the aggregate for people that take these up. But customers may due to such a fair exchange for getting the upgrade more often, so there's a customer proposition for it. Other than that I think we have great relationships with the carriers. I think they were as we were very happy with the iPhone rollout.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Thank you, Chris.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple CFO Peter Oppenheimer. And he\u2019ll be joined by CEO Tim Cook, and Vice Vice President and Corporate Controller Luca Maestri for a Q&amp;A session with analysts.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Please note that some of the information you\u2019ll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margins, operating expenses, other income and expense, stock-based compensation expense, taxes, and future products.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple\u2019s Form 10-K for 2013 and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Peter Oppenheimer for introductory remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you, Nancy. We\u2019re very pleased to report the results of the first quarter of Apple\u2019s fiscal year \u201914. We established new all-time quarterly records for iPhone and iPad sales and had one of our best Mac quarters ever, driving the highest quarterly revenue and operating profit in Apple\u2019s history. We were also very pleased with our results in emerging markets around the world.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Revenue for the quarter was $57.6 billion, up $3.1 billion, or 6%, from the year ago quarter and near the high end of our guidance range. No technology company has ever generated that much revenue in a single quarter, and we\u2019re especially pleased to have generated that record despite foreign exchange headwinds, the year over year decline in iPod sales, and the higher revenue deferral rates from iOS devices and Macs that we discussed last quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">These three factors negatively impacted revenue by about $2.5 billion, and without them, our year over year revenue growth would have been about 10%. Gross margin was 37.9%, above the high end of our guidance range, and operating margin was an all-time record of $17.5 billion, representing 30.3% of revenue. Net income was $13.1 billion, translating to diluted earnings per share of $14.50, a new record.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">As for the details of the quarter, I\u2019d like to begin with iPhone. Despite supply constraints on iPhone 5S, we sold 51 million iPhones compared to 47.8 million in the year ago quarter. That\u2019s an increase of over 3 million phones, or 7%, and a new quarterly record.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">iPhone sales growth was very strong year over year in Japan, thanks to the addition of NTT Docomo in September and our continued partnership with Softbank and KDDI. In fact, based on the latest data published by Kantar, iPhone accounts for 69% share of the smartphone market in Japan.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We also generated strong year over year iPhone growth in greater China, Latin America, the Middle East, and Russia. In the U.S. market, Apple remains the leading smartphone manufacturer, with iPhone accounting for 41% of smartphone subscribers in the three-month period ending in November, according to ComScore.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We\u2019re very pleased to have reached a multiyear agreement with China Mobile, the largest network in the world, with over 750 million customers, and to be selling iPhones through their expansive network of stores, beginning on January 17. China is an incredibly important market to Apple, and iOS devices already account for 57% of all mobile web browsing in China.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">iPhone customers are loving their phones, and continue to produce the highest loyalty rates in the industry. A December survey of U.S. customers by ChangeWave indicated a 96% customer satisfaction rate for iPhone. And based on the latest data provided by Kantar, iPhone customers have a 90% loyalty rate, significantly higher than the competition.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We exited the quarter with about 15.3 million total iPhones in channel inventory, which represented a sequential increase of less than 1 million units from the September quarter, and left us within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPhone channel inventory.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">The release of new iPhones with iOS 7 introduced powerful new security and management features for business and enterprise customers. And iOS 7 has received FIPS 140-2 certification from the U.S. federal government. These features, coupled with ease of developing custom enterprise apps, continue to make iPhone the device of choice for large organizations.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Many companies, including Accenture, Cisco, and American Airlines, have tens of thousands of employees using iPhones for work. In fact, some, including Deloitte and GE, have over 50,000 iPhones each on their networks around the world. And based on the latest data published by IDC, combining business, government, and education institutions, iPhone has a 59% share of the U.S. commercial smartphone market.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Turning to iPad, despite supply constraints, we sold over 26 million iPads during the quarter, compared to 22.9 million in the year ago quarter. That\u2019s an increase of over 3 million iPads, or 14%, and represents a new all-time quarterly sales record.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">iPad sales were very robust in Mainland China, where sales more than doubled year over year. We also experienced strong iPad sales growth in the Middle East, Latin America, Russia, and parts of Western Europe.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Customers are loving the new iPad Air and iPad Mini, with Retina Display, introduced in October, and response to the more affordable iPad Mini has been very strong. In fact, a November ChangeWave survey of customers planning to buy a tablet within 90 days found that 72% plan to purchase an iPad. And among customers who already owned an iPad, the survey measured a 97% satisfaction rate.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We exited the quarter with 6.2 million units of iPad channel inventory, a sequential increase of about 2.1 million units, which placed us within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPad channel inventory.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Based on the latest data published by IDC, iPad has a 78% share of the U.S. commercial tablet market, and iPad continues to spark innovation for businesses around the world. Leveraging custom developed and App Store apps, progressive IT organizations have embraced mobility, armed employees with iPad, and fundamentally changed the way people do their jobs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">British Airways has deployed thousands of iPads to their employees across the business, including senior cabin staff, engineers, check-in staff, pilots, and ground crew. At Kindred Healthcare, iPads are now being used by the sales team, executives, and thousands of therapists nationwide, resulting in millions of dollars of estimated savings and productivity gains for Kindred and their customers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">And this football season, nearly every team in the NFL use iPads as playbooks, replacing their traditional three-ring paper binders. In the education market, schools continue to choose iPad and the great content available across apps, books, and courses. To date, U.S. educational institutions have purchased over 7 million iPads. In fact, we\u2019ve sold over 750,000 iPads to K-12 schools in the state of Texas alone, including 7,000 iPads rolling out to all K-12 students in the Midway Independent School District.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We have expanded the availability of iBook textbooks in four countries to over 50 countries, so that students and teachers around the world can experience the power of what a textbook can be. We continue to add new titles from key education publishers like Oxford University Press and Cambridge University Press. In addition, nearly 25,000 books have been created and published by individual educators using iBooks Author, bringing lessons to life in exciting new ways.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">And over 1,000 institutions are delivering courses and content through iTunes U. At the Ohio State University, where there are over 20,000 iPads on campus, faculty have developed over 70 iTunes U courses in less than one school year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We remain very focused on providing a great user experience for our iPhone and iPad customers, and we\u2019re extremely pleased that the iOS platform continues to lead the industry in user engagement. According to IBM\u2019s Digital Analytics Benchmark, iOS devices accounted for more than twice the online traffic and more than five times the online sales compared to Android devices on both Black Friday and Christmas Day.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">IBM reported that iOS devices represented 32.6% of online traffic on December 25, and more than double the 14.8% for Android. While iOS devices drove 23% of online sales that day, 5x the 4.6% for Android. And, according to the latest reports by TechInsights, iPhone accounted for 54% of North American smartphone web traffic, while iPad accounted for 78% of tablet traffic.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">These usage percentages are far greater than the share of the smartphone and tablet markets represented by our devices, and they underscore just how engaging and important our iPhones and iPads are to the people who own them.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We\u2019re also very pleased with our customers\u2019 adoption of iOS 7. As of this month, 80% of iOS devices are running iOS 7. That dwarfs the single-digit adoption percentage measured for the latest version of the Android operating system, and makes iOS 7 the most popular operating system in the world. The rapid transition to the latest version of iOS provides a more advanced and secure experience for our customers, and a more streamlined opportunity for our developers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to Mac, we sold 4.8 million Macs, compared to 4.1 million in the year ago quarter, an increase of 19%, making this among our best Mac quarters ever. The growth was driven by significantly increased sales of iMac and Macbook Air, while sales of Macbook Pro also remained strong.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Mac sales grew in each of our operating segments, led by Europe and greater China. We were also very pleased to have generated such strong results for our Mac products, particularly given IDC\u2019s most recently published estimate of a 6% year over year contraction in worldwide personal computer sales. Macs have now gained global market share for 30 of the last 31 quarters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We were happy to begin selling the all-new Mac Pro last month, manufactured in the U.S., and we had great customer response to OS X Mavericks, now available for free and running on millions of Macs around the world. And we were also delighted to be providing our groundbreaking iWork productivity apps for free of charge to our Mac, iPhone, and iPad customers. We ended the quarter with Mac channel inventory that was within our 4-5 week target range.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">30 years ago this week, Apple launched the Macintosh. Not only was the Macintosh a breakthrough for the personal computer, it was also a promise that the power of technology taken from the few and put in the hands of everyone could change the world. Over the past 30 years, people have done extraordinary things with the Mac, and with the Apple products it inspired.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">To coincide with the 30 year mark, we\u2019ve taken a look at what people have accomplished on a special website that showcases their Mac stories. Their achievements are a result of Apple\u2019s continued commitment to create and deliver the best technology to people all over the world, every day. Happy Birthday, Mac. Imagine what we can accomplish in the next 30 years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We continue to be very pleased with the growth of iTunes software and services and the strength of the Apple ecosystem. Total revenue from iTunes software and services was $4.4 billion, an increase of 19% year over year. Our iTunes stores generated record billings of $4.7 billion in the December quarter, thanks primarily to strong growth in App Store sales.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">The quarter of iTunes billings translated to quarterly iTunes revenue of over $2.4 billion, up 14% from the year ago quarter, and a new all-time record. Software and services revenue was about $2 billion, up 26% from the year ago quarter, and also a new record. We achieved these records despite the fact we are now making iPhoto, iMovie, Pages, Numbers, and Keynote free with new iOS device purchases, and we\u2019re also making Mavericks, iLife, and iWork free to our Mac customers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As we mentioned last quarter, we are now deferring a greater amount of revenue for each new iOS device and Mac sold as a result of the free software and associated upgrade rights. At the end of the quarter, our total deferred revenue from all sources was $11.4 billion, and we expect to realize $8.4 billion of it in the next four quarters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">The App Store now offers 1 million apps in 24 categories and cumulative downloads have surpassed 65 billion. Our app developers earned 2 billion from sales in the App Store in the December quarter. That translates to $15 billion in cumulative App Store earnings for our developers, about half of which was generated in the last four quarters, and we are thrilled with the success that they have achieved.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In China specifically, we have an incredibly vibrant iOS and Mac developer community. Developers in China have created over 130,000 apps on the App Store to date. A recent study by Business Insider Intelligence indicated that iOS has a 5x advantage over Android when it comes to developer revenue per app download, a 4x advantage in revenue from in-app purchases, and a 2x advantage in revenue from paid downloads plus in-app purchases.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">And according to a recent report from Distimo, the App Store has a 63% to 37% market share advantage over Google Play in global revenue from apps. Top developers continue to launch their apps first, or exclusively, on the App Store.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Examples of highly successful launches from 2013 include Temple Run 2 and Cut The Rope 2, which generated millions of downloads in multiweek periods of App Store exclusivity. NaturalMotion recently launched Clumsy Ninja exclusively on iOS and saw 10 million downloads in the first week. And Plants Versus Zombies 2 resulted in the biggest game title launch ever for Electronic Arts\u2019 Pop Cap, with 16 million downloads from the App Store in the first five days alone.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">With the introduction of iOS 7, developers are able to create stunning apps to take advantage of the redesigned user interface and more than 200 new features and APIs. And many of the App Store\u2019s biggest recent successes, including Candy Crush Saga, Puzzle &amp; Dragons, Minecraft, QuizUp, and Clumsy Ninja, were created by international developers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">The seamless integration of the iOS platform, the global reach of our ecosystem, our thoughtful app review process, and our highly engaged customers continue to make the App Store a superior marketplace for our extremely talented developer community.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">I\u2019d now like to turn to the Apple retail stores. Revenue for the quarter was $7 billion, a new quarterly record, and in increase of 9% from the year ago quarter. The growth was fueled by record iPhone and iPad sales through the stores as well as strong Mac sales.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We completed the remodel of six stores and opened four new stores during the quarter, ending with a total of 420 stores, including 166 outside the United States. With an average of 418 stores open during the December quarter, average revenue per store was $16.7 million, compared to $16.3 million in the year ago quarter. Retail segment income was $1.7 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We hosted 114 million visitors to our stores during the quarter, which translates to almost 21,000 visitors per store, per week. We were excited to roll out iBeacon technology at our stores in the U.S. during the quarter, enabling shoppers to receive iPhone notifications about products and services via the Apple Store app.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">iBeacon transmitters use Bluetooth wireless technology to sense a shopper\u2019s exact location inside an Apple Store and send messages based on the aisle or product the customer is near. For example, customers walking by an iPhone table could receive a message offering to help them check their upgrade eligibility or trade-in value of an existing phone. We expect to see many innovative uses of iBeacon technology from other businesses and developers in the coming months, including retailers and professional sports.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Total company operating expenses were $4.4 billion, and included $572 million in stock based compensation expense, aligning with $246 million, and the tax rate for the quarter was 26.2%. And turning to our cash, we ended the quarter with $158.8 billion in cash or short term and long term marketable securities, a sequential increase of $12 billion from the September quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Our domestic cash was $34.4 billion at the end of the December quarter, a sequential decline of $1.1 billion. $124.4 billion, or 78%, of our total cash was offshore at the end of the December quarter, and cash flow from operations was $22.7 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We paid $2.7 billion in dividends in the quarter, and we executed an additional $5 billion in repurchases of 9.6 million shares of Apple stock during the quarter. This brings us to a cumulative total of over $43 billion in payments for dividends and share repurchases over the last six quarters, of which share buybacks were $28 billion. This has resulted in Q1 retirement of 56.5 million shares and represents 6% of the total shares outstanding prior to the launch of the repurchase program.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Our board of directors has declared a dividend of $3.05 per common share, payable on February 13, 2014, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 10, 2014. Now, as we move ahead in the March quarter, I\u2019d like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We expect revenue to be between $42 billion and $44 billion, compared to $43.6 billion in the year ago quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 37% and 38%, reflecting approximately $110 million related to stock based compensation expense. We expect opex to be between $4.3 billion and $4.4 billion, including about $590 million related to stock based compensation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We are continuing to invest heavily in R&amp;D, in both current revenue generating categories as well as future products and services. We expect OI&amp;E to be about $200 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26.2%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">In closing, we are very pleased with our record iPhone and iPad sales, the strong performance of our Mac products, and the growth of iTunes software and services revenue. We are thrilled to have the most satisfied, loyal, and engaged customers in our industry, and we are confidently working to make the user experience even better for them. We are continuing to invest heavily in our future, and remain very confident in our new product pipeline.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">With that, I\u2019d like to open the call to questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Thank you, Peter. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow up. Operator, may we have the first question, please?</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p5\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">[Operator instructions.] First, we\u2019ll go to Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Peter, revenue guidance embeds a sequential decline that\u2019s bigger than what you experienced in the March 2013 quarter, and I think implies iPhone units may not grow in the March quarter year on year. So can you just talk about what\u2019s driving the cautious view on the top line for March?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">The biggest reason for the larger sequential decline in revenue this year relates to changes in channel inventory between the years. And I\u2019ll go through some detail, but let me actually do it on a year over year basis. I\u2019d like to go through some things about the guidance, and I think you\u2019ll see that the underlying performance of our business is stronger than what the guidance might imply.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We expect four factors to negatively impact the year over year revenue comparison by over $2 billion. These are channel inventory increases in the year ago quarter that we don\u2019t expect to repeat, lower iPod sales, a stronger U.S. dollar against a number of currencies, particularly the yen and the Australian dollar, and the higher per unit deferral for Mac and iOS devices that I talked about in my prepared remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Let me go through these a little more. First, beginning with channel inventory, in the March quarter last year, we increased channel inventory for both iPhone and iPad, whereas this year we increased the channel inventory for both product families in the December quarter, and we exited within our target range of channel inventory.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">For iPhone, specifically last year, the supply of iPhone 5 was short for the entire December quarter, and we were not able to achieve supply and demand balance for iPhone 5 until the March quarter. As a result, we increased the iPhone inventory last year by about 1.1 million units.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">In contrast, this year we executed the fastest rollout for our new iPhones, and we included China in wave one, in the launch in September, and we were able to exit the quarter in supply and demand balance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">For iPad, we introduced the Mini in the December quarter last year, and we were not able to meet demand in any week of the quarter. We didn\u2019t reach supply and demand balance for the iPad Mini until the March quarter last year, and we increased inventory in the March quarter by 1.4 million units. In contrast, this year we exited the December quarter near supply and demand balance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So looking past the inventory changes year-to-year, we expect the value of the underlying sell through to grow year over year, and we\u2019re very confident in what we\u2019re shipping.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Turning to iPod, sales declined by 52% year over year in the December quarter, and we would expect them to continue to decline year over year in the March quarter. And FX is a headwind for us with the strengthening dollar against a number of currencies. So when you consider these factors, we\u2019re very pleased with the underlying performance of the business and the revenue growth is stronger than what the guidance might imply.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">And Peter, you\u2019re guiding OpEx flattish sequentially, despite the big revenue downtick. Are there any one-time items in SG&amp;A and R&amp;D in the March quarter? Or is the run rate reflective of investments for future opportunities?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">It\u2019s definitely the latter, and let me have Luca take you through some details.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Luca Maestri </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Yes, at the midpoint of the range of our guidance, we are expecting a minor decrease of $50 million. This is largely due to the lower variable expenses that we\u2019re going to have, in line with the seasonal sequential decline in revenue. But one thing that Peter already mentioned in his remarks is that we continue to invest very heavily in R&amp;D. We make investments in areas that are visible to all of you today, but also in areas that are not visible, which we\u2019re very excited about. And for the things that are not visible to you, obviously were impacting ahead of the revenue that these products and services will generate in the future. So there is nothing that is one-off in nature in our guidance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">From Goldman Sachs, we\u2019ll go to Bill Shope.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">I have a question on the revenue guidance as well. The ramp of China Mobile would presumably act as a tailwind to the March quarter, yet that\u2019s not apparent in the numbers. Can you comment on how you\u2019re thinking about demand trends for China Mobile and perhaps how it compares to prior large carrier ramps?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Let me start, then Tim may want to have some comments. We\u2019re thrilled to be working with China Mobile, and Docomo also. We had a great launch with both carriers, Docomo in the December quarter and China Mobile just in the last couple of weeks. These carrier additions will have a positive impact on our iPhone sales year over year. China Mobile\u2019s 4G service is only available in 16 cities today, and they plan to complete the rollout of more than 500,000 4G base stations, which will cover more than 340 cities by year-end.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">With the addition of Docomo last quarter, we were able to achieve 69% smartphone market share in Japan, which we\u2019re thrilled with. However, the benefit of these two carrier additions this quarter is being partially offset by a couple of things: first of all, the comparison last year from our late launch of the iPhone 5 and the new iPad in Mainland China, achieving supply and demand balance for the Mini and the iMac in the March quarter, and the impact of currency, particularly the yen. And we\u2019re also deferring more revenue on the iOS devices and Mac.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And so to summarize, we\u2019re very, very pleased with what we\u2019re seeing from both carriers. We expect to continue to do well, but we\u2019ve got some things that are offsetting it, that we factored into the guidance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Tim Cook </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">I would add, as a further update, we\u2019ve been selling with China Mobile now for about a week, and last week was the best week for activations we\u2019ve ever had in China. So it\u2019s been an incredible start, and at this moment, we\u2019re just selling in 16 cities with China Mobile, and as Peter alluded to, this number is projected to be over 300 cities by the end of this year. And so we\u2019ve got quite the ramp in front of us, and we\u2019re incredibly excited.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">This comes after a new high water mark in China for us last quarter. We grew revenues including our retail stores at 31%, and we had some very, very strong sales on iPad. iPads in greater China were up 64% year over year, Macs were up 28%. This compares to a tablet market in China that\u2019s growing at 21% per IDC, and a PC market that is contracting by 7%. And so in addition to the great iPhone news with China Mobile and how we\u2019re looking there, we really turned in a stellar quarter in greater China overall, and we are very proud of it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Can you comment on your progress so far in getting down the cost curve for the iPhone/iPad? And would you say you\u2019re in line with the types of improvements you\u2019ve seen in cycles prior to the iPhone 5?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Tim Cook </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">You can see that we projected in the guidance, gross margins between 37% and 38%, and that\u2019s despite going from a holiday quarter to a non-holiday quarter, which we lose quite a bit of leverage from doing that. And so one of the primary things that\u2019s going on there is cost. So yeah, we\u2019re happy with how we\u2019re doing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And next we\u2019ll hear from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Shannon Cross - Cross Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Can you talk a bit more about opportunities in the mobile payment market? And maybe talk about what you\u2019re seeing with regard to use of the touch sensor for mobile payments in your iTunes store, and then how you sort of think about this as an opportunity, whether over time it\u2019s revenue or margin?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Tim Cook </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Let me sort of avoid the last part of your question, but in general, we\u2019re seeing that people love being able to buy content, whether it\u2019s music or movies or books, from their iPhone, using Touch ID. It\u2019s incredibly simple and easy and elegant, and it\u2019s clear that there\u2019s a lot of opportunity there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">The mobile payments area in general is one that we\u2019ve been intrigued with, and that was one of the thoughts behind Touch ID. But we\u2019re not limiting ourselves just to that. So I don\u2019t have anything specific to announce today, but you can tell by looking at the demographics of our customers and the amount of commerce that goes through iOS devices versus the competition that it\u2019s a big opportunity on the platform.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And we\u2019ll hear from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I have one for Tim, and then a follow up, please. Tim, I wanted to just step back and talk a little bit about iPhone market share. The market data isn\u2019t out for Q1, but if we look at your prior four quarters, fiscal \u201913, Apple grew its iPhone units about 20%. The market grew in the 40s. I think this quarter, even with a new product and having China front loaded, the iPhone is going to grow at a fraction of ultimately what the market is likely to grow at.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And I know your belief and philosophy historically has been that you want to make the best product, and that\u2019s the most important thing, but in Macs, you\u2019ve actually succeeded in making the best product and being able to gain share. You cited again how you\u2019ve gained share in 30 out of the last 31 quarters in Mac. But in iPhone, that is not happening.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And so my question is, what is different about the smartphone market that is not allowing you to hold or gain unit share despite apparently having the best product, and do you propose to do anything differently going forward, because I think it\u2019s great to have an aspiration to make the best products, but I think that\u2019s in the spirit of ultimately growing at least in line with or faster than the market. And that doesn\u2019t appear to be happening.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Tim Cook </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">As I\u2019ve said before, our objective has always been to make the best, not the most. And we feel we\u2019re doing that. If you look at what we did this year, we announced two iPhones for the first time, rather than one. And looking at last quarter, if you looked at our sell through - so not sell in, but the sell through - of what I\u2019ll just call our entry phone, or mid phone, and our top phone, with the 5S, all of those grew year over year versus the phones that were in those categories previously.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">If you look at the emerging markets, which is one of the things that I\u2019ve alluded to that we have to grow in these areas and grow at reasonable amounts, in Latin America we grew at 76% year over year. In the Middle East and Africa, we grew at 65%. In central and eastern Europe, we grew 115%. In China, we grew at 20%. However, as you know, we just added China Mobile, the largest carrier there, in this quarter, and did not have channel load in China Mobile last quarter. We just started selling those in January.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Also, in Japan, as we\u2019ve added Docomo, iPhone units were up 40%. Now, when you translate that performance into revenue in Japan, and we have the issue with the yen that Peter spoke about earlier, and so the revenue growth looks much less than that, because of the strength of the dollar there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">In North America, we did not do as well, and this weighed our results. Our North American business contracted somewhat year over year. And if you look at the reason for this, one was that as we entered the quarter, and forecasted our iPhone sales, where we achieved what we thought, we actually sold more iPhone 5Ss than we projected.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And so the mix was stronger to the 5S, and it took us some amount of time in order to build the mix that customers were demanding. And as a result, we lost some sort of units for part of the quarter in North America and relative to the world, it took us the bulk of the quarter, almost all the quarter, to get the iPhone 5S into proper supply.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">The other thing that happened in North America specifically was that some carriers changed their upgrade policies. And this affected last quarter, and will have some effect on the current quarter. This restricted customers who are used to upgrading earlier than the 24 months that they\u2019re allowed and sort of stretched the time out to be a hard and fast 24 months. And so that\u2019s a major factor playing into the North American results.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So as I back up and sort of zoom out on this, and look at it, one of the most important things for us in the iPhone business was to do really well in emerging markets, and we had the best quarter ever from that respect. Another was to grow in China, because I think you can\u2019t be in the business that we\u2019re in and not have a reasonable China business. And you can see how we did last quarter, and we\u2019ve now followed that up with a deal with China Mobile. And so I feel great about that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I think part of what\u2019s happening in North America is a short term effect because of these upgrade policy changes. This affects the period of time, three to six months, I would think, and then it washes through. So as I look at it, I feel very good about where we are, and I would guess that the market numbers, some of the stuff that you\u2019ve been seeing, will actually be decreased as the revisions come out, given what you\u2019re hearing and what everyone is saying.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I\u2019d like to follow that up, just on your comments on China. You\u2019ve characterized the agreement with China Mobile as huge. Could you tell me what would define success for you in China Mobile one and three years out? What ultimately should we be looking at to measure and ultimately determine whether this was huge?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Tim Cook </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I\u2019m not going to give you a forecast for it. I think if you just back up and look at it from a common sense point of view, China Mobile has more subscribers than anyone in the world. They have three quarters of a billion, and so I do see it as a watershed moment for Apple, and have a very strong belief in the ability of those two companies to do great things together.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Ben Reitzes with Barclays.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Ben Reitzes - Barclays</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">My question is for Tim. You\u2019re at the midpoint of your guidance. It obviously implies a decline in revenue in the quarter coming up, and you haven\u2019t done that forever. You came pretty close a couple of quarters ago, but you had some growth. And my question is, are you still a growth company? And should we expect the growth rate to accelerate as we go throughout the year? And why, if that\u2019s the case?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Tim Cook </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I think it\u2019s important to listen to what Peter said about the guidance, and about the compares year over year, and the point that he made that the underlying sell through, that we\u2019re very confident of growth year over year. And that is the way we look at it. Some people just look at the numbers on a piece of paper, but the way I\u2019d look at the business is our business from a sell through point of view less iPod, because I think all of us have known for some time that iPod is a declining business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And when you do that, the numbers from last quarter, and the deferral, which we\u2019ve just increased, as Peter went through, when you look at that, and look at the numbers from last quarter, it comes up to a double digit growth. And we\u2019re proud of that. I think that\u2019s a pretty good result. We\u2019ll see how we do in the March quarter, but I do think it\u2019s important in the March quarter to take into consideration sell through versus just a view of sell in.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Ben Reitzes - Barclays </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And I guess there\u2019s been a lot of things in the media about your potential to buy back more stock, and shares are around $500 tonight. I was wondering if you thought this was a good level, and whether it was time to accelerate the buyback from current levels. You obviously generated a ton of cash in the quarter, and what are your latest thoughts there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Tim Cook </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We\u2019ve been buying back stock. As you know, last year we increased the program overall, our cash return, doubling it to $100 billion. And $60 billion of that is buyback, and we\u2019ve been progressing on that. Luca can give you the precise numbers of it. So we\u2019re a big believer in buying back the stock, and that doesn\u2019t change today, whether the stock goes up or down.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">From UBS, we\u2019ll go to Steve Milunovich.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Steve Milunovich - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong> </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Could you talk a bit more about the gross margin? It did provide an upside surprise to your guidance in the quarter. What were the factors? And then looking forward, what are some of the gives and takes for the March quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Luca Maestri </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Let me answer that one. Let me start with the quarter. We were above the guidance range. It was primarily for two factors. We had favorable product mix, and we had favorable commodity pricing. And so those were the two things that actually helped us come in above the guidance range. For the quarter, for Q2, we\u2019re guiding 37% to 38%, compared to 37.9% in the December quarter. We\u2019re going to have some loss of leverage, as you can imagine, because of the usual seasonal decline in revenue. But we expect that loss of leverage to be largely offset by cost improvements and also by less deferred revenue that we\u2019re going to have in Q2.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Steve Milunovich - UBS </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And then regarding overall demand, one thing you didn\u2019t mention, Tim, is maturity of the particularly high end smartphone market. I know in our surveys we\u2019re finding, relative to a year ago, a lot higher percentage or Apple buyers already have an Apple handset. So I\u2019m curious if you think the Western world can show decent unit growth over the next year or two. And I was also wondering, the 5C generally is viewed as having turned out to be pretty light in the mix. What are you going to do with that product going forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Tim Cook </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Well, I\u2019ll sidestep the last question, of course, because it\u2019s about future products. But to your question about the 5S in particular, if I look at the sell through year over year, there was growth in that portion of the line, despite adding an entirely new phone underneath it. And so I think that\u2019s a good sign, and that\u2019s despite it being in short supply for the bulk or virtually all of the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And so I do believe that that category of product can grow in those markets, if you\u2019re thinking about the U.S. and western Europe, for example, and Japan. In Japan, we grew 40% last quarter. That\u2019s fairly good.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Brian Marshall with ISI Group.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Brian Marshall - ISI Group</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Obviously the iPhone business grew about 7% year over year, $200 million in [unintelligible] unit sales now. And that\u2019s with two new [unintelligible] being launched in the quarter. Can you help us think about how you guys view the iPhone new user growth out there in the marketplace versus simply a solid replacement cycle that the company has in its installed base?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Tim Cook </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We saw a significant new to iPhone number. It\u2019s not a number that we throw out, but we particularly saw that on the 5C, which is what we wanted to see. So it\u2019s clearly not just upgraders. As a matter of fact, the upgraders, particularly in North America, would have been less than we thought, because of the changes in the upgrade policy that I talked about earlier.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Brian Marshall - ISI Group </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And then with respect to innovation at the company, obviously iPhone came out in 2007, iPad came out in 2010. 2013 came around, we\u2019ve got some new products, obviously, but nothing really from our new product category. Do you care to comment on the innovation cycle of the company and the cadence there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Tim Cook </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">It\u2019s never been stronger. I\u2019m very confident with the work that\u2019s going on, and I think our customers are going to love what we\u2019re going to do.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">We\u2019ll go to Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I had a question and a follow up. And Tim, for you, the first one, to follow up from Brian\u2019s question, you\u2019re growing iPhones about 7%. I think the market is going to end up looking up to be 14%. Are you happy with the pricing umbrella that you currently have? When you originally brought out iPhones, in subsequent periods you talked about wanting to push some pricing umbrellas. But are you happy with the pricing umbrellas that you have? In particular, as you think about the 5C, I think most of the industry views have panned the product as not being enough features for that price point. But if you could just talk about the positioning of your broader product portfolio on iPhones. Are you happy where you are?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Tim Cook </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I think last quarter we did a tremendous job, particularly given the mix was something very different than we thought. It was the first time we\u2019d ever run that particular play before, and demand percentage turned out to be different than we thought. We obviously always look at our results, and conclude what to change moving forward. And if we decide it\u2019s in our best interest to make a change, then we\u2019ll make one. Obviously I\u2019m not going to predict price changes on the earnings call.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Sorry, not price changes, but at least product position. Are you willing to expand the product portfolio into new categories within the phone family?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Tim Cook </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">We\u2019re willing to make any product that\u2019s a great product. Where our line in the sand is, it\u2019s making something that\u2019s not fantastic.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. Then my follow up for you Peter is, you mentioned four factors that influenced guidance. In particular, you talked about inventory. I think most investors would conclude then December wasn\u2019t as good as it looked, if you had increases in channel inventory. So I was hoping you could peel off a little bit and talk about the foreign exchange impact and the higher deferrals. Is there a way to quantify that impact on the guidance in March in particular?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">As I had said to one of the early questions, the four factors, we expect to be over $2 billion. And the inventory is the largest, and then the other three are less than the inventory and not too terribly far apart. <strong> </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">From Pacific Crest Securities, we\u2019ll go to Andy Hargreaves.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Andy Hargreaves - Pacific Crest Securities </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Just a quick follow up to some of your comments about demand mix being significantly different, or different than what you thought, in the quarter. Do you have any thoughts on why it was so much different than what you expected it to be?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Tim Cook </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I think the 5S, people are really intrigued with Touch ID. It\u2019s a major feature that has excited people. And I think that, associated with the other things that are unique to the 5S, got the 5S to have a significant amount more attention and a higher mix of sales.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Andy Hargreaves - Pacific Crest Securities </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And then just on the comments on R&amp;D and working on things that aren\u2019t visible to us, you guys have done a lot of things in recent years, sort of in support of the existing products. Are we to read those comments that you\u2019re working on things that are material new revenue drivers, new potential legs of the stool? Or are these more services that would support the existing customer base? <strong> </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">What Luca is saying is that we\u2019re working on things that are things that you see that we\u2019re shipping today but that we\u2019re working on things that you can\u2019t see today.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">The next question will come from Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Mark Moskowitz - JPMorgan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">What\u2019s your user data kind of telling you right now in terms of the replacement cycle? Are you starting to see a lot of heritage Apple users now refresh their iPhone every three years plus, or their iPad every two years plus, versus previous? Are you seeing any major changes there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Tim Cook </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">We don\u2019t have great data yet from last quarter. And so I don\u2019t know the answer to your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Mark Moskowitz - JPMorgan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And then the follow up is around this opex being flat relative to the revenue guidance. Is there something around the vertical in terms of maybe increasing focus on the enterprise vertical that you see an opportunity to take advantage of, maybe hiring more folks to service that industry?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">It\u2019s clear that the enterprise area has huge potential, and we\u2019re doing well from a percentage of companies that are using iPhone and iPad. It\u2019s up to unbelievable numbers. The iPhone is used in 97% of the Fortune 500, and 91% of the Global 500, and iPad is used in 98% of the Fortune 500 and 93% of the Global 500. And we have a number of accounts, some of which Peter reviewed in the opening remarks, that have tens of thousands of iOS devices working.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And also, as I think was mentioned earlier, 90% of tablet activations in corporations are iPads. And 95% of total app activations were on iOS. And I think that\u2019s an incredible measure of ultimately how sticky the products are, because you can get so much productivity out of an iPad and an iPhone.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And so I think the road in enterprise is a longer one. The arc is longer than in consumer, which can immediately go out and buy things, etc. And I think we\u2019ve done a lot of the groundwork as you can tell from these numbers that I\u2019ve given you, and I would expect that it would have more and more payback in the future.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And the next question will come from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Just a follow up to some of the previous questions. Tim, I\u2019ve got to ask it. In the previous quarters, you\u2019ve talked about specifically product categories multiple, and that\u2019s different than variations of existing products. And that would be by the end of 2014. I just want to be clear that\u2019s still on track, and consistent with some of the expenses that we talked about earlier in the call?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Tim Cook </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes, absolutely. No change.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And then second, and this goes back to some of the other themes on the call here too, but you\u2019re obviously going to have a big year in terms of new product categories. And maybe even thinking beyond 2014, when the new products come out and they kind of ramp in 2015, how do you think about the trajectory of the platform, or what would you say to investors to say this is just a product cycle story?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I would just say, innovation is deeply embedded in everybody here, and there\u2019s still so much of the world that is full of very complex products, etc. We have zero issue coming up with things we want to do that we think we can disrupt in a major way. The challenge is always to focus to the very few that deserve all of our energy. And we\u2019ve always done that, and we\u2019re continuing to do that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">A replay of today\u2019s call will be available for two weeks as a podcast on the iTunes store, as a webcast on Apple.com/investor, and via telephone. And the numbers for the telephone replay are 888-203-1112 or 719-457-0820. And please enter confirmation code 9268358.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Speaking first today are Apple CEO, Tim Cook, and Vice President and Corporate Controller, Luca Maestri, and they will be joined by CFO, Peter Oppenheimer for the Q&amp;A session with the analysts.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Please note that some of the information you\u2019ll hear during our discussion today will consists of forward-looking statements, including without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margins, operating expenses, other income and expense, stock-based compensation expense, taxes, future products and capital allocation plans.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple\u2019s Form 10-K for 2013, the Form 10-Q for the first quarter of fiscal 2014, and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon, everyone. We have a lot to share with you over the next hour, and I\u2019d like to start right away with the very strong results we\u2019re reporting for the March quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We generated $45.6 billion in revenue, which was ahead of our expectations and represents a new March quarter record, and is our strongest non-holiday quarter ever. Our underlying business performance was even stronger than our reported results imply. When you take into account changes in channel inventory this year versus last year and foreign exchange had wins that we faced in several of our international markets. Setting foreign exchange and inventory changes aside, our underlying growth rate would have been close to double digits.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">These strong revenue results combined with our best gross margin percentage since September of 2012 resulted in earnings per share growth of 15%, which is our highest earnings growth rate in the last six quarters. iPhone was key in driving our stronger-than-expected results. We sold almost 44 million iPhones, setting a new March quarter record. These stronger results were broad-based both from a product point of view with demand for each of our three iPhone stronger than its predecessor and from a geographic standpoint.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We gained smartphone share in many developed and emerging markets including the U.S., the UK, Japan, Canada, Germany, France, Vietnam and Greater China, just to mention a few. In fact, we established a new all-time record for total iPhone sales in the BRIC countries.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">iTunes software and services revenue continue to grow at a double-digit rate, thanks to an incredible ecosystem and our very large, loyal and engaged customer base. With its strong momentum in growing profitability, iTunes is a very important driver of our business not only here in the United States, but around the world. We now have an almost 800 million iTunes accounts, most of these with credit cards. This is a staggering number.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We continue to gain share in the personal computer market as well. We defied industry trends again by growing while the market contracted. Our bold decision to make OS X free has resulted in the largest ever percentage of the Mac installed base running on the latest version of the operating system just months after its release.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">iPad sales came in at the high end of our expectations, but we realized they were below analyst estimates, and I would like to proactively address, why we think there was a difference. We believe almost all of the difference can be explained by two factors. First, in the March quarter last year, we significantly increased iPad channel inventory, while this year we significantly reduced it. Luca will go into more detail about this later.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Second, we ended the December quarter last year with a substantial backlog with iPad mini that was subsequently shipped in the March quarter, whereas we ended the December quarter this year near supply demand balance. We continue to believe that the tablet market will surpass the PC market in size within the next few years and we believe that Apple will be a major beneficiary of this trend.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">When we look at our company performance on a geographic basis, we\u2019re especially proud of our very strong results in Greater China, where we established an all time quarterly revenue record of almost $10 billion including the results from our retail stores. And in Japan, where revenue was up 26% in spite of the foreign exchange headwinds and where our smartphone market share reached an incredible 55%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We are continuing to invest in our retail stores and since our last call, we had opened our first stores in Brazil and Turkey and we now have retail stores in 15 countries around the world. I\u2019m looking forward to welcoming our new retail and online leader, Angela Ahrendts, who will be joining Apple\u2019s Executive Team next week. Stepping back, we are now just passed the halfway mark for fiscal 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Our strong March quarter results bring us to total revenues of over $103 billion for the first six months of the year and earnings per share growth close to double-digits. We estimate that over the last six months, we\u2019ve added over $60 million new registered users of our four product categories. Additionally, over two-third\u2019s of people registering an iPad in the last six months, were new to iPad, while over half of the people registering iPhones were new to iPhone.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">It is wonderful to add tens of millions of first time Apple product users, especially considering the strong halo effect, we\u2019ve seen over and over again in our history. Customers who have a great experience with their first Apple products, often become loyal and happy owners of the multiple Apple products overtime.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">As always, I\u2019d like to thank our talented employees who make these results possible through their creativity and passion they bring to their work everyday. And I\u2019d like to thank our hundreds of millions of customers for their loyalty and enthusiasm and for continually inspiring us to surprise and delight them.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In addition to our quarterly results, we are also announcing an update to our capital return program today, and I\u2019d like to share a few thoughts about our guiding principles for capital allocation and our conclusion on the changes we are making for this year. Apple has created tremendous value for shareholders by developing great products that enrich people\u2019s lives and that will always be our top priority and driving force.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We\u2019ll continue to innovate by investing in research and development and capitalizing on our strengths in hardware, software and services. We\u2019ll keep investing in our supply chains promote scale and efficiencies, expanding our global presence by building retail stores, investing in marketing and distribution and extending our reach into new markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We are expanding Apple\u2019s products and services into new categories and we are not going to under invest in this business. We are also investing through acquisitions and we\u2019ve acquired 24 companies in the past 18 months. To invest organically and to make acquisition strategically, we need to maintain financial flexibility. With this framework in mind, Apple\u2019s Board and management team, will do capital allocation regularly and we solicit input on our program from a broad base of shareholders.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We very much appreciate all of the input that so many of our shareholders have provided us on how the best to deploy our cash. We\u2019ve continued to seek investor input going forward and we\u2019ll update you on our conclusions around this time each year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">This regular process allows us to continually evaluate return of capital in light of the most current information available and it enables us to be thoughtful about the size, mix and pace of the program. We continue to be in the fortunate position of being able to return significant capital to shareholders. We started doing so two years ago when we announced our first program of $45 billion and we more than doubled the program last April to $100 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Today, we are announcing that we are increasing the size of our program once again with an addition of over $30 billion for a total program size of over $130 billion. The size and pace of our program is unprecedented and we still expect to complete it by December of 2015 as we announced last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We think very deliberately about how much and in which way to return cash to our shareholders. We decided to continue to allocate the vast majority of the incremental capital return to share repurchases because we believe our current stock price does not reflect the full value of the company. The size of the share back increases the signal of the Board and the management team\u2019s strong confidence in the future of Apple.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We also understand the importance of the dividend to many of our investors and we are increasing it for the second time in less than two years. We believe this is a meaningful increase for those shareholders who value income and we are planning for annual dividend increases going forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Now, I would like to turn the call over to Luca for the details of our quarterly results as well as more information about our capital return program.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"><strong>Luca Maestri</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Thank you Tim and good afternoon everyone. As Tim said revenue for the March quarter was $45.6 billion, up $2 billion or 5% from a year ago and above our guidance range. Sales in each of our major product categories were at the high end of our expectations or better and the vast majority of the revenue upside came from strong sales of iPhone.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Gross margin was 39.3%, also above our guidance range and operating margin was $15.6 billion, representing 29.8% of revenue. Net income was $10.2 billion translating to diluted earnings per share of $11.62.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">For details by product, I\u2019d like to start with iPhone. We sold 43.7 million iPhones which was a March quarter record. That\u2019s an increase of 6.3 million iPhones over last year that represents 17% growth. The addition of China Mobile coupled with great response to our more affordably priced iPhone 4S led to an all time quarterly record for iPhone sales in Greater China. We look forward to broadening our relationship with China Mobile as they expand points of sale and continue to build out their 4G network.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In Japan, iPhone sales were up over 50% year-over-year resulting in significant market share gains, as Tim mentioned we\u2019ll try strong growth and share gains in many other major developed markets based on IDCs latest estimates for the March quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">iPhone also continued to perform exceptionally well in many developing markets. In Greater China, Brazil, Indonesia, Poland and Turkey. iPhone sales grew by strong double-digits year-over-year, and in India and Vietnam sales more than doubled.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We exited the quarter with 15.4 million total iPhones in channel inventory, which represents a sequential increase of about 100,000 from the December quarter and left us within our target range of four to six weeks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In the enterprise market progressive organizations are leading the charge to replace legacy devices and systems, and are using iPhone and iOS to drive innovation at their companies. Deutsche Bank has nearly 20,000 iPhones running on its network and has created 40 internal apps that extend the capabilities of its mobile workforce.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Siemens have 30,000 iPhones on its network and has deployed over 50 internal apps for field service teams, sales associates and corporate executives for solution that are only possible with iOS and iPhone. We are really happy with the continued growth and strength of the Apple ecosystem.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Total revenue from iTunes software and services was $4.6 billion, an increase of 11% year-over-year at an all time quarterly record. Our iTunes stores generated record billings of $5.2 billion in the March quarter, up 24% year-over-year driven by very strong growth in App Store sales. These iTunes billings translated to quarterly iTunes revenue of over $2.6 billion, up 9% from the year ago quarter, and also a new all-time record.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Software and services revenue was over $1.9 billion, up 14% from a year ago. App Store momentum is incredibly strong as cumulative app downloads at 70 billion, 87% of iOS devices are now running iOS 7 and our highly engaged users are a great audience for developers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">According to App Annie, the App Store generated 85% more global revenue than Google Play in the March quarter despite the differences in unit market share between iOS and Android devices.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Now, I\u2019d like to talk about the Mac. We saw 4.1 million Macs compared to just under 4 million in the year ago quarter. Thanks to strong performance from MacBook Pro and MacBook Air and Macs have now gained global market share for 31 of the last 32 quarters. Response to Mavericks has been great, and we are very proud of the fact that so many of our Mac customers are taking advantage of the most advanced and secured experience possible. We ended the quarter with Mac channel inventory slightly below our four to five week target range.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to iPad, we saw 16.4 million units. As Tim explained earlier, our iPad results and the comparison to the March quarter last year were heavily influenced by channel inventory changes. Specifically, this year we saw 16.4 million iPads into our channels and sold through almost 17.5 million reducing our channel inventory by 1.1 million units.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Last year we sold over 19.4 million iPads into our channels and sold through 18 million and therefore increased channel inventory by 1.4 million units. As a result, the year-over-year sell through decline was only 3% compared to the sell in decline of 16%. We exit the March quarter with 5.1 million units of iPad channel inventory, which left us within our target range of four to six weeks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">iPad continues to lead all other tablets by far in terms of user engagement, size of ecosystem, customer satisfaction and e-commerce. A recent study by Chitika Insights found that iPad users in North America generate almost four times the web traffic of all Android tablet users combined.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In a February survey, ChangeWave measured a 98% customer satisfaction rate for both iPad Air and iPad Mini with Retina display. And also found that among people planning to purchase a tablet within 90 days two-thirds plan to buy an iPad. iPad continues to allow companies around the world to reimagine the way they use technology to drive efficiency and improve employee satisfaction. Thousands of iPads are used at FedEx everyday. In an industry where efficiency is critical FedEx pilots and maintenance crews around the world use iPad to transform operational processes and save the company millions of dollars.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Eli Lilly has deployed over 20,000 iPads and 50 internal apps as part of a laptop replacement program that dramatically increased the productivity and capabilities of its employees.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs is on its way to deploying iPads to 11,000 providers to transform the way doctors and patients interact. As part of this initiative, a suite of applications is being developed to allow quick access to real-time secure medical information. In education, according to the latest data published by IDC, iPad has over 95% share of the U.S. education tablet market as teachers and students increasingly benefit from the growing range of engaging iBooks, textbooks and solutions that are helping to transform the education experience.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $150.6 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential decline of $8.3 billion. Our domestic cash was $18.4 billion at the end of the March quarter, a sequential decline of $16 billion and $132.2 billion or 88% of our total cash was offshore. Cash flow from operations was very strong at $13.5 billion for the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">In total, we executed almost $21 billion worth of capital return activities during the March quarter. First, we launched our third accelerated share repurchase program in late January through which we will acquire an additional $12 billion of Apple stock. We received an initial delivery of 19.2 million shares under this ASR and we received a balance of shares due when the program concludes by December of this year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Second, we paid $2.7 billion in dividends in February. And finally, we spent $6 billion on open market purchases of 11.4 million shares throughout the March quarter. At the end of March, we also settled our second ASR program, which was launched in April of last year, resulting in the retirement of an additional 1.1 million shares.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">I would like now to go into more detail about the expansion of our capital return program that we\u2019re announcing today. Let me start by summarizing the progress that we\u2019ve made on the program we updated a year ago. By the end of March 2014, we\u2019ve already taken action of $46 billion of the current $60 billion share repurchase authorization, over 75% of the program with seven quarters remaining to its completion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We have acted aggressively and opportunistically and have delivered on our intention to return capital to shareholders at a fast pace. Including dividends and net-share-settlements, we\u2019ve taken action on $66 billion of total $100 billion program announced last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Today we\u2019ve taken additional steps that will increase the overall size of the program from $100 billion to over $130 billion within the same timeframe of December 2015 as before. There are two elements to the expansion of the program. First, we\u2019re increasing the size of our share repurchase authorization from $60 billion to $90 billion. We are very confident in Apple\u2019s future, and we believe our current stock price does not reflect the full value of the Company. That\u2019s why the vast majority of our capital program continues to be allocated to share repurchases. We will also continue to net-share-settle, restricted stock units and expect to utilize about $1 billion of cash annually for that purpose.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Second, our Board has declared a dividend of $3.29 per common share payable on May 15, 2014 to shareholders of record as of May 12, 2014. That represents an increase of about 8% in our quarterly dividend. We understand the importance of dividend increases to many of our investors, and we\u2019re increasing the dividend for the second time in less than two years. We are planning for continued annual increases and we\u2019re very proud that Apple is one of the largest dividend payers in the world, with annual payments of $11 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">All our capital return activities must be funded by domestic cash which as I mentioned was about $18 billion as we exited the March quarter, and down from $39 billion in the quarter that we paid our first dividend. We would maintain sufficient domestic liquidity to grow the business and execute capital expenditures and acquisitions. Thanks to Apple\u2019s strong growth in international expansion in recent years. We have built substantial offshore cash balances to repatriate our fall in cash on the current U.S. tax law, we will incur significant cash tax consequences and we don\u2019t believe this would be in the best interest of our shareholders.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We continue to advocate for comprehensive corporate tax reform and streamlining the tax code which we believe would be of great benefit to the U.S. economy. To execute our updated capital return program in a tax efficient manner and leverage our very strong balance sheet, we intend to access the debt markets again. We plan to be active in both the domestic and international bond markets during 2014 for an amount of term debt financing similar to what we issued in 2015, with a break down between markets currencies and tenures to be determined over the course of the year and subject to prevailing conditions in each market.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We have also prepared ourselves to access the commercial paper market given the substantial short term liquidity and flexibility that this channel can provide.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Now, as we move ahead into the June quarter, I\u2019d like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $36 billion and $38 billion compared to $35.3 billion in the year ago quarter. We expect gross margins to be between 37% and 38%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We expect OpEx to be between $4.4 billion and $4.5 billion. We are continuing to invest heavily in R&amp;D for current revenue generating categories as well as future products and services. We expect OI&amp;E to be about $200 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 26.1%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">And now, I\u2019d like to turn it back to Tim.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Thanks Luca. In addition to the changes to our capital return program<strong> </strong>today. We are also announcing a seven-for-one split of Apple common stock which will occur in June of this year. We are taking this action to make Apple stock more accessible to a larger number of investors. Each shareholder of record at the close of business on June the 2nd, 2014 will receive six additional shares for every outstanding share held on the record day and trading will begin on a split-adjusted basis on June the 9th, 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Finally, before we start the Q&amp;A, I would like to take a minute to talk about my dear friend and colleague Peter Oppenheimer. As you know, Peter will be transitioning from the CFO role in June. Peter has been Apple\u2019s CFO for 10 years and the list of his accomplishments is immense. Apple is now more than 20 times the size it was when Peter became our CFO and his expertise, leadership and incredibly hard work had been instrumental to the company\u2019s success. I\u2019d like to thank him very publicly for his contributions to Apple, from the very bottom of my heart and wish him all the best in his approaching retirement at the end of September.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">And I\u2019d also like to recognize him that he has never missed guidance in the 10 years as CFO which must be an all-time record for CFOs. We\u2019re really happy and fortunate to have someone with Luca\u2019s talent on Board to replace Peter. He has over 25 years of experience, building and leading finance teams in global companies and has an exceptionally broad international background, which you might be able to detect from his accent. He\u2019s been managing most of Apple\u2019s financial functions since coming on Board last year and has done an outstanding job. I\u2019m looking forward to working with Luca even closer as Apple\u2019s next CFO.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">With that, I\u2019d like to open the call for questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Thank you, Tim. We\u2019d like to ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up please. Operator, may we have the first question.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p7\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">(Operator Instructions) Your first question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Katy Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Thanks. Congrats on the great quarter. Tim, if I heard you right that $800 million account is a staggering jump from the last time you reported that number and yet iTunes, software and services growth decelerated again this quarter. Can you just talk a little bit about your view on the importance of better monetizing the installed base in the future? And then I have a follow-up.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Keep in mind, in that category there\u2019s several things, not just the App Store kind of revenues and so if you looked at App Store only, it would look a little different than what you\u2019re seeing. But in terms of your question about monetization, I do believe that we can monetize more than we owe from a services point of view in existing areas and in new areas. And I\u2019m particularly encouraged that when I look at the App Store and how it\u2019s doing the strength was broad based. And in fact in China the growth was in the triple digits.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Katy Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. And then question the around iPhone ASPs, just looking at the trend iPhone 5s, demand has surprised to the upside over this cycle. Does that give you any confidence that Apple could actually charge more for highly innovative products in the future or does the strategy remain to add innovation at the same price as previous versions of a product?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">We price things that we think \u2013 are priced in such a way that we think it\u2019s a fair price for the value that we\u2019re delivering and we make those on each thing as it gets closer time to come to market.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Katy Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. Thank you. Peter, much luck to you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Thanks, Katy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Thank you, Katy. Could we have the next question please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">From Goldman Sachs we\u2019ll hear from Bill Shope.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Bill C. Shope \u2013 Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay, great. Thanks. Can you walk through the key drivers of the June quarter gross margin guidance off of what was admittedly very sharp upside for the March quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Luca Maestri</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Sure. Bill, I\u2019ll take that. So March quarter was very good as you said. There were three seasons for it. We had obviously better volume as you\u2019ve seen from our revenue results. We had better cost than anticipated, and we had some favorable mix of both products and services. As we get into Q3, obviously as you\u2019ve seen from our revenue guidance we are expecting some loss of leverage, which would come from the sequential decline in revenue. It\u2019s about 19% at the midpoint of the range, and we\u2019re also expecting less favorable mix. This is something very typical that happens to us as we move farther away from the quarter when we launched the new products. To offset that, it's only going to be a partial offset. We will have some cost improvements.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Bill C. Shope \u2013 Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Then looking at the iPhone upside for the March quarter, obviously, it looks like China was a key driver here, but within the U.S., did you see as much pressure from the changes in U.S. carrier upgrade policy that you had discussed last quarter, and was demand I guess just strong enough to completely counter that? And then is this headwind behind us now, and potentially a tailwind in the U.S. as we head into the June quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">We saw some pressure in the quarter because of the stricter enforcement of upgrade policies. So this was primarily in the U.S. as I mentioned last time. But if you really look at iPhone, the strength of iPhone was very broad-based and as I've mentioned, we gained share in a whole host of markets, from developing markets like the U.S., U.K., France, Germany to more of the emerging markets like China, Vietnam, and had the largest total sales of iPhone in the BRIC countries that we've ever seen in our history. And so we feel very good about that the strength was broad-based.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Bill C. Shope \u2013 Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Great thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thanks Bill. Could we have the next question please.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">We\u2019ll hear from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Toni Sacconaghi \u2013 Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yes. Thank you. Peter best wishes going forward. I have one question for Luca and a follow-up for Tim please. Luca, on the iPhone ASPs this quarter, they were down a little over $40. I think that was the largest sequential decline that we've seen in history. I was wondering if you could help us understand what drove that. Was it entirely mix? You mentioned good growth in each of the three models, but were you seeing particularly strong growth in the 4s? I think you mentioned that in China. And how significant if any was selling older generation for iPhone 4?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Luca Maestri</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yes, Toni. When you look at the $41 of decline, I would say about half of that was driven by the fact that we have continued to do very well in emerging markets with the 4s. I have mentioned that there is a lot of markets where we've grown very strongly in Latin America, in Asia-Pacific, in Eastern Europe. So, about half of that decline came from the stronger sales of the 4s. And then the rest was primarily the fact that, again as we move away from the quarter where we launched a product, we tend to have lower capacity mix in our numbers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Toni Sacconaghi \u2013 Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. Tim, I was wondering if you could talk about how you think about replacement cycles generally for the iPhone over the longer term. Clearly U.S. carriers have started introducing plans that may ultimately encourage people to keep their phone longer than two years, because their total price paid is less. And so one could argue and I'd like your opinion on whether you think that could push out replacement cycles.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I guess, the other consideration is the imperative for Apple to continue to introduce really great products to want to have people upgrade at the same frequency. And I guess, the dilemma in doing that is as we've seen with the 5 and with the 4 is introducing really great products, typically puts pressure on your BOM and pressures margin. So perhaps you could just tell us how you think conceptually about where you think replacement cycles go over time and why? And then secondly, how do you address this dilemma of well in order to make a great phone it typically costs more to do so and managing their potential margin pressure.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">There is a lot there, let me see if I can address it quickly and I want to just add one thing to the point that you asked Luca. Just to be clear on the iPhone 4 question, we sold a very, very low single-digit percentage of those and so it had extremely minimal impact of results on the quarter. In terms of the general upgrade or the installed base, some of the programs that the carriers are running may serve to increase the upgrade cycle because there are some areas where customers can pay a bit more in the beginning and have the ability to essentially upgrade each year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So I think there is some that work that way. I think there is some that work the way that more of the way that you're leaning, and how these balanced are very difficult currently to conclude.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">But regardless of how those balance, what I see as the bigger opportunity for Apple is that the smartphone market is still only 1 billion or so units and it will eventually take over the entire mobile phone market. We've seen our ability to attract new users to iPhone to be very significant in the emerging markets. We were seeing new to iPhone numbers on the iPhone 4s sales in the 80 percentages in certain large geos. So, this to us give us a great comfort that we can continue to grow and we may not be able to attract some of those buyers to our top phone because of the price point. But if we can get them in on the entry iPhone, it gives them a great product, at a great value and gets them into the ecosystem.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And as you know from following us for a while, our ability to keep customers is very good and our ability to show other products that Apple produces to a family that's buying Apple product is also very good. And so, at the macro level, I see the opportunity of the market and getting more people into the Apple ecosystem much larger than any of the noise around the different carrier plans, some of which I think helped, and some of which I think worked the opposite way and it's completely unclear to me how those net.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">It's probably also important to know that the bulk of the things you're seeing in the U.S. are not occurring in many of the other geos in terms of the upgrade policies and so forth. I mean, each country has its own kind of cadence associated with this, and the U.S. is \u2013 it\u2019s in the 30% of our business, not 100%. So it\u2019s important to weigh it with a proper perspective.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Toni Sacconaghi \u2013 Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. And any comments on the latter part of that around, sort of the imperative to continue to come out with really great products that ensure people have an incentive to upgrade, yet when we\u2019ve seen you really revolutionize phones between iterations we\u2019ve seen margin pressure?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">The most important thing, Toni, that we do is to make great products that really get our users excited to want the next one and that will always be the case. And you can bet that that\u2019s where the vast majority of all of our attention is on doing this thing. In terms of the BOM pressure of any new product, you have seen in the past that exists. I think you\u2019ve also seen that we have a way of working down the cost curve. That was certainly very key in achieving the 39.3% gross margin from this past quarter. And as I said before, we price things at a level that is fair for the value that we are providing, and so we\u2019re certainly not stuck on certain price points. We price that values that are fair for the value that we are delivering.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Toni Sacconaghi \u2013 Sanford Bernstein</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thank you, Tony. Could we have the next question please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And from UBS we\u2019ll hear from Steve Milunovich.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Steven M. Milunovich \u2013 UBS Securities LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thank you. Tim, I understand that the iPad is not as weak as it appears on a sell-through basis, but still it\u2019s relatively flat over the last year in terms of sell-through. What are your thoughts in terms of why that is and can that accelerate with Office on the iPad going forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">It\u2019s a good question. Let\u2019s talk about iPad a little more than we did in the comments. When I backup from iPad, here\u2019s what I see. It absolutely has been the fastest growing product in Apple\u2019s history and it\u2019s been the only product that we\u2019ve ever made that was instantly a hit in three of our key markets, from consumer to business including the enterprise and education.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And so, if you really look at it in just four years after we launched the very first iPad, we\u2019ve sold over 210 million, which is more than we or I think anyone thought was possible at that period of time. And it\u2019s interesting to note that that\u2019s almost twice as many iPhones that we\u2019ve sold in a comparable period of time, and over seven times as many iPods as we\u2019ve sold in the period of time. So, I think it\u2019s important to kind of to put that in perspective. We\u2019ve come a long way very, very quickly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Looking at it by market a bit, which I think is important. I think Luca mentioned a little bit of this in his comments. In the education market in the U.S., we have a 95% share. And so the focus in education is on penetration, is on getting more schools to buy and my belief is the match has been lit, and it\u2019s very clear to the educators that have studied this is that student achievement is higher with iPad in the classroom than without it. And so I\u2019m confident we\u2019ve got a really great start in education far beyond the U.S. now. This is happening in many, many parts of the world.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">In the enterprise market, we\u2019re seeing virtually all, 98% of the Fortune 500 that using iPad. And we\u2019re seeing, according to Good Technology who looks at activations of tablets, the latest data we have from them is that 91% of the activation of tablets in enterprise were iPads. And so this is also an astonishing number and many of those enterprises are writing apps that are key proprietary apps for running that business, and this is great for that company because they\u2019re more productive as a result of that. And so once again, just like in education in a way, what we have to do in enterprise is focus on penetration. It has to be deeper and broader. But in terms of having people begin the process, beginning writing apps, we\u2019re doing a pretty good job of that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">In the retail market, if you look at the U.S. as a proxy, the NPD numbers for March just came out a few days ago and we had 46% share and embedded in that 46%, there\u2019s a lot of things in there that I personally wouldn\u2019t put in the same category as iPad and that are weighing the share down. It\u2019s certainly a market we wouldn\u2019t play in and a type of product you would never see an Apple brand on. So we feel like we\u2019re doing well there. Office, I believe does help. It\u2019s very unclear to say how much. I believe if it would have been done earlier, it would have been even better for Microsoft frankly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">There is a lots of alternatives out there from a productivity point of view, some of which we brought to the market, some of which many, many innovative companies have brought. But I do see that Office is still a very key franchise in the enterprise, in particular. And I think having it on iPad is good, and I wholeheartedly welcome Microsoft to the App Store to sell Office. Our customers are clearly responding in a good way that it\u2019s available. So, I do think it helps us particularly in the enterprise area.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">The other things you look at on iPad that are just blow away as customer sat is 98. There is almost nothing in the world with a 98% customer sat and the intention to buy numbers look good with two-thirds of the people planning to buy a tablet or planning to buy an iPad. The usage numbers are off the chart, far and exceeding Android tablets, four times the web traffic of all Android tablets combined.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And so, when I backup from all of these, I feel great. That doesn\u2019t mean that every quarter, every 90 days is going to be a number that everybody is thrilled with. But what it means to me is that the trend over the arc of time that things look very, very good, that iPad has a great future. And of course the thing that drives us more than any of this are the next iPads if you will, the things that are in the pipeline, the things that we can do to make the product even better and there is no shortage of work going in on that nor any shortage of ideas.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And so when I backup from all of this, I can\u2019t help but still be extremely excited about where we are.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I think we did a reasonable job of explaining what we think the disconnect was between what we had expected, which we hit it at the high end of our expectation and the street's view of this one. I believe the vast majority of it is that first thing was just channel inventory that maybe we should have been even clearer on last quarter to take into account. But I'm very bullish on iPad.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Steven M. Milunovich \u2013 UBS Securities LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay, very complete thank you. One other question, when you look at Google and Amazon and Facebook, they've very much diversified their business over time in a way that one has rarely seen. Apple, sort of the opposite. People say you ought to buy this or that and you'll do acquisitions, but you're obviously very focused. Is that because it's just a management philosophy of wanting to be more focused than some of these other companies? Or is there something about Apple's products that particularly being more hardware oriented that kind of prevents you from saying, yes, let's go make TV shows or let's go often do something else, even though you probably have the money and the technical capability to do all these things?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">The key thing for us, Steve, is to stay focused on things that we can do best and that we can perform at a really high-level of quality that our customers have come to expect. And so we currently feel comfortable in expanding the number of things we're working on. So we've been doing that in the background and we're not ready yet to pull the string on the curtain. But we've got some great things there. We're working on them. Very, very proud of and very, very excited about.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">But for us, we care about every detail and when you care about every detail and getting it right, it takes a bit longer to do that and that's always been the case, that's not something that just occur. As you probably know from following us for a long time, we didn't ship the first MP3 player, nor the first smartphone, nor the first tablet. In fact, there were tablets being shipped a decade or so before then, but arguably, we shipped the first successful modern tablet and the first successful modern smartphone and the first successful modern MP3 player. And so it means much more to us to get it right than to be first.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I think you can see so many examples out in the marketplace, where it's clear that the objective has been to be first. But customers at the end of the day don't care about that. That's not what they look for from Apple. They want great, insanely great and that's what we want to deliver, and so that's the way we look at it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">From an acquisition point of view, we have done 24 in 18 months. That shows that we're on the prowl, I suppose you could say. We look for companies that have great people and great technology and that fit culturally. And we don't have a rule that says we can't spend a lot or whatever. We'll spend what we think is a fair price. What's important to us is that strategically it makes sense and that it winds up adding value to our shareholders over the long haul. We are not in a race to spend the most or acquire the most. We're in a race to make the worlds' best product that really enrich people's lives.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So, to the tune that acquisitions can help us do that and they've done that and continue to do that, then we will acquire it. And so you can bet that you will continue to see acquisitions and some of which we'll try to keep quiet and some of which seems to be impossible to keep quiet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thank you, Steve. Could we have the next question please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">From Cross Research, we\u2019ll hear from Shannon Cross.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Shannon S. Cross \u2013 Cross Research LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thank you. First I just want to tell Peter, thank you very much, we've really enjoyed working with you over the past 10 years. But then secondly, in terms of a question for Tim, can you talk a bit about the competitive landscape for smartphone? If you look at some of your competitors seem to be have cut prices fairly quickly in the most recent product cycle, perhaps faster than before. You've got Microsoft about to close on Nokia. Lenovo is buying Motorola, there is a lot going on from a sort of competitive standpoint. So I'm curious as to how you're seeing the market?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes, there is a lot of moving parts, a lot of acquisitions, a lot of people giving up to some degree and deciding to do other things. But at the end of the day we see it much like we've always seen it, as the part of the market that we're interested in is the market of people that really want the best smartphone and that doesn't mean that they're all at the high end of the price stand. I mean, we have smartphones that go down to a very affordable price with the 4S because we're proud to ship that product.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I think that this quarter, if you were unsure, hopefully this quarter demonstrates to you that we can do well in a number of geographies from emerging markets to develop markets. Some of the numbers that we've experienced just to quote some of the more historic prepaid market through the first half of 2014; Brazil was up 61%, Russia was up 97%, Turkey was up 56%, India was up 55%, Vietnam was up 262%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I could go on, but the point is that there's a number of markets out there where we are beginning to really catch on to a number of customers, and I am particularly proud of the results in these markets because these have not been historic strong points for Apple. We've been working at China for a while and have learned a lot and I'm very proud of what we've done there. But I think some of these other numbers I just read demonstrates that we're beginning to have really nice success outside of there as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Shannon S. Cross \u2013 Cross Research LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Great and then, if you can just, actually as a follow-up on the China side, I think it grew at 13% year-over-year, and you mentioned obviously China Mobile has been the driver of that. But can you talk about some of the other categories as well, and perhaps some of the other carriers in terms of where you're seeing demand out of China?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes, really great question. We did have an all-time revenue record in Greater China, just under $10 billion at $9.8 billion. iPhone sales were up 28%, that's versus the IDCs market forecast of 20% growth. So we gained share. Mac units were up double-digit, in particular they were up 13%, and that's far outpacing IDCs PC market forecast of a negative 8%. So we gained share there as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">If you look at the iTunes software and services revenue in China, we more than doubled it. Year-over-year, we were in the triple digits percentages. And if you look at iPad and you take out the channel inventories, ins and outs and look at demand instead of sell in, we grew by 6% and that compares to IDC\u2019s forecast of a flat tablet market in China for last quarter. And so we literally did well in every single area in China. It wasn\u2019t just because we were able to come to an agreement with the world\u2019s largest carrier. That was certainly key, but as you can tell from the rest of these numbers there are other things going on.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Also, I\u2019d mentioned this briefly with Steve, but I think it\u2019s important to point out that if you look at some of the numbers we\u2019re seeing on first-time iPhone buyers, people that bought the iPhone 4s, 85% were first-time iPhone buyers, and the 5c, 69% first-time iPhone buyers. So these are extraordinary, and as you would expect, these are also heavily Android switchers. 62% of the people that bought the 4s switched from Android. 60% of the people that bought the 5c switched from Android. And so we\u2019re incredibly pleased with this.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">For the first half, including our retail stores, Greater China revenue topped $19 billion. So this is a 21% year-over-year, and is our fastest growing region. So, we\u2019re looking at this data and deciding to continue investing in a big way. We plan to triple the number of Apple Retail Stores over the next two years. We\u2019re continuing to expand in online. We\u2019re continuing to build out channels.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">We\u2019re up to 40,000 points of sales now in iPhone, but we\u2019re not nearly where we need to be on the rest of our product line and even the 40,000 is a low number in considering the broad landmass and the number of folks in China. And so, I feel like there\u2019s still loads of opportunity there, and feel really, really good about how we\u2019re doing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Shannon S. Cross \u2013 Cross Research LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Thanks, Shannon. Could we have the next question please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And from Piper Jaffray we got Gene Munster.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Gene Munster \u2013 Piper Jaffray</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Hey, good afternoon and I\u2019ll add congratulations to Peter on itinerary for the record there. And Tim, I want to talk a little bit about some of your comments at the recent shareholder meeting. You mentioned that Apple TV is no longer a hobby. Wanted to hear a little bit about why you made that distinction? And separately, it would be interesting to hear your feedback on the HBO Amazon announcement today and what you think that means, if anything, in terms of some content partners being a little more \u2013 work with some more players like yourself? Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Good questions, Gene. The reason that I stripped off the hobby label is that when you look at the sales of the Apple TV box itself, and you look at a content that was bought directly off of Apple TV for 2013, that number was over $1 billion. And so, it didn\u2019t feel right to me to refer to something that\u2019s over $1 billion as a hobby. Also from an investment point of view, we continue to make the product better and better. And so it doesn\u2019t feel right from that point of view either.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">We had HBO GO already on Apple TV and you have to authenticate in order to use it, but you have to do that with Amazon service as well from my brief read of their announcement. I think they in addition to that got some older content from HBO to put on there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I haven't had a chance to evaluate exactly what it is and don't have a personal point of view on that yet. But if I look broadly at the content on Apple TV, I think it compares extremely favorable to the content that is on the Amazon box. We've sold now, Gene, about 20 million of the Apple TV, and so we've got a pretty large installed base there. And I'm feeling quite good about that business and where it can go.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Gene Munster \u2013 Piper Jaffray</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Excellent, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">You bet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Thank you, Gene.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong><span>Nancy Paxton</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><span>Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks everyone for joining us today. Speaking first is Apple CEO, Tim Cook; and he will be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri, and then we'll open the call for questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you\u2019ll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margins, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, future products.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><span>Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast.

Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><span>I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong><span>Tim Cook</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><span>Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon, everyone. It\u2019s been a very busy and exciting time at Apple and I'd like to review some of the highlights of our June quarter. We hosted our best ever Worldwide Developer\u2019s Conference last month with over 20 million people from around the world watching our keynote session, which is the a record. We've had overwhelming response from customers and developers to the new features we previewed in OS X Yosemite and iOS 8. Yosemite has been redesigned with a fresh look and powerful new apps and iOS 8 is the biggest release since the launch of the App Store. With powerful continuity features, these upcoming releases will allow Macs and iOS devices to work together in even smarter ways.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><span>Customers can start on activity like writing an email on one device and pass it to another, picking up where they left off without missing a beat. They will even be able to make and receive iPhone calls on their Mac with just a click. These are features that only Apple can deliver. With iOS 8, we have opened over 4000 APIs providing more flexibility and opportunity for developers than ever before. iOS 8 provides developers with amazing new frameworks, enables wide use of Touch ID to securely authenticate users within apps and lets developers further customize the user experience with major extensibility features such as third-party keyboards.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><span>We have also introduced Swift, an innovative new programming language for both iOS and OS X. Swift is the result of the latest research on programming languages, combined with decades of experience within building Apple platforms. It makes writing code interactive and fun, eliminates entire classes of unsafe code and generates apps that run lightning fast. It's easy to learn, allowing even more people to dream big and create whole new categories of apps. We believe our new OS releases, combined with Swift will result in a huge leap forward for the Apple ecosystem and we can\u2019t wait to what developers will create with Yosemite, iOS 8 and Swift.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><span>When we introduced iOS 7 years ago, it was a revolutionary operating system for iPhone. Over the years we've extended it to the iPod family with iPod Touch and later to a tablet form factor with iPad. An explosion of apps, accessories and services for these devices has created an incredibly vibrant ecosystem. We\u2019re extending iOS in even more dimensions as customers around the world make iPhones and iPads an essential part of their lives, at home, at school, at work and on the go. We\u2019re putting a huge effort into delivering the best experience to our customers wherever they use iOS. That includes a safe and intuitive user interface for driving, called CarPlay, which is being integrated by 29 major car brands including Audi, BMW, Ford, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Mercedes, Toyota and Volvo; and after-market systems like Pioneer and Alpine.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><span>We\u2019ve created a new tool for developers called HealthKit, which allows health and fitness apps work to together and empowers customers to choose what health data they share. We're taking the first steps in this area in collaboration with the Mayo clinic, whose new apps can automatically receive data from a blood pressure app, for example and share it with a physician, or a nutrition app can inform fitness apps how many calories are being consumed each day. Our ARM health app will provide an easy to read dashboard of all health and fitness data.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><span>We're enabling new ways to control light and doors and thermostats and other connected devices around the house using Siri with the HomeKit feature of iOS 8. And in the Enterprise, we are including new security, productivity and device management features in iOS 8. We forged a relationship with IBM to deliver a new class of mobile business solutions to enterprise customers around the world. We are working together to provide companies access to the power of Big Data analytics, right on every employee's iPhone or iPad. Using Swift, we will collaborate to bring over 100 Mobile First apps to enterprise clients, each addressing a specific industry need or opportunity.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><span>This is a radical step for Enterprise and opens up a large market opportunity for Apple but more importantly, it\u2019s great for productivity and creativity of our enterprise customers. From the pocket to the car, to the workplace, home and gym, we have a very large vision of what iOS can be and we're incredibly excited about our plans.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><span>Turning to our financial results, today we are reporting record June quarter revenue, thanks to the very strong performance of iPhone, Mac and the continued growth of revenue from the Apple ecosystem. Our teams executed brilliantly during the quarter with earnings per share up 20% year-over-year, our highest growth rate in seven quarters.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><span>We sold over 35 million iPhones, setting a new third quarter record. We generated healthy growth in our entry priced, mid-tier and lead iPhone categories. I'm especially happy about our progress in the BRIC countries, where iPhone sales were up a very strong 55% year-over-year.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><span>We also had a record June quarter for Mac sales, with growth of 18% year-over-year in a market that is shrinking by 2% according to IDC\u2019s latest estimate. Demand has been very strong for our portables in particular and we've have had a great customer response to the new higher performance, lower priced MacBook Air. It was another strong performance for the App Store and the other services contributing to the thriving Apple ecosystem.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><span>In fact for the first nine months of this fiscal year, the line item that we call iTunes software and services has been the fastest growing part of our business. iTunes billings grew 25% year-over-year in the June quarter and reached an all-time quarterly high, thanks to the very strong results from the App Store. We're continuing to invest in our incredible ecosystem, which is a huge asset for Apple and a very important differentiator of our customer experience. iPad sales met our expectations but we realized they didn\u2019t meet many of yours. Our sales were gated in-part by a reduction in channel inventory and in-part by market softness in certain parts of the world. For example IDC\u2019s latest estimate indicates a 5% overall decline in the U.S. tablet market, as well as a decline in the Western European tablet market in the June quarter.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><span>But what\u2019s most important to us is that customers are enjoying their iPads and using them heavily. In a survey conducted in May by ChangeWave, iPad Air registered a 98% customer satisfaction rate, while iPad Mini with retina display received an astonishing 100% customer satisfaction rate. The survey also found that among people planning to purchase a tablet within 90 days, 63% plan to buy an iPad and our own data indicates that more than half of customers purchasing an iPad are buying their very first iPad.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"><span>Another recent study by Custora found that iPad accounts for 80% of all U.S. tablet based e-commerce purchases. We're very bullish about the future of the tablet market and we're confident that we can continue to bring significant innovation to this category through hardware, software and services. We think our partnership with IBM, providing a new generation of mobile enterprise applications, designed with iPad\u2019s legendary ease of use and backed by IBM\u2019s cloud services and data analytics will be one such catalyst for future iPad growth.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"><span>Looking ahead, we are very excited about our agreement to purchase Beats Electronics and Beats Music. We think its part of Apple\u2019s DNA and we think the addition of Beats team will be great for music lovers. Beats provides Apple with a fantastic subscription music service, access to rare talent and a fast growing line up of products that we can build upon. Not counting Beats, we've completed 29 acquisitions since the beginning of fiscal year 2013 including five since the end of the March quarter and we have brought some incredible technology and more importantly some incredible talent into Apple in the process. We are hard at work and investing heavily on exciting opportunities across our business and we have an incredible pipeline of new products and services that we can\u2019t wait to show you.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"><span>With that I would like to turn the call over to Luca to discuss our Q3 results in more detail.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"><strong><span>Luca Maestri</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"><span>Thank you, Tim and good afternoon everyone. We set a new June quarter record for revenue at $37.4 billion, up $2.1 billion or 6% year-over-year. This result was towards the high end of our guidance range, despite a reduction in channel inventory for both iPhone and iPad. The revenue growth was driven by strong sales of iPhones and Macs, as well as the continued great performance of iTunes softwares and services. Gross margin was 39.4%, above our guidance range and operating margin was $10.3 billion, representing 27.5% of revenue. Net income was $7.7 billion, translating to diluted earnings per share of $1.28, a 20% year-over-year increase.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"><span>For details by product, I'd like to start with iPhone. We sold 35.2 million iPhones, an increase of 4 million over last year, representing 13% growth. As Tim mentioned, iPhone sales grew well across all three of our entry-price, mid-tier and lead product categories.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"><span>In the U.S., iPhone accounts for 41.9% of the smartphone subscriber base according to the latest data from ComScore, up from 41.3% in the previous measurement period. Also based on the latest survey by ChangeWave, iPhone earned a 97% customer satisfaction rate and among responders planning purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 50% planned to purchase an iPhone, up from 42% in the March quarter and 44% a year ago.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"><span>iPhone sales were at the high end of our expectations, despite new product rumors that we believe resulted in purchase delay. In addition, tax increases and the regulatory environment in Japan affected smartphone sales in what has been one of iPhone\u2019s fastest growing markets in recent quarters. Considering these factors, the performance of iPhone was even more impressive in the June quarter and it boosts our confidence for the future. We reduced iPhone channel inventory by about 150,000 from the end of the March quarter, leaving us within our target range of four to six weeks.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"><span>Apple continues to innovate through hardware, software and services to make iPhone the best smartphone for business. Today, companies have equipped millions of employees with iPhones and they are seeing tremendous benefits in productivity, employee satisfaction and profitability. For instance medical device leader Medtronic has developed over 175 internal iOS apps for over 16,500 iPhones used by its employees to facilitate sales, improve productivity and ensure that essential marketing materials are up to date. Throughout the global offices of Nestle, the largest food company in the world, over 25,000 iPhones are accessing corporate networks, improving communication and connecting employees to critical internal resources. And at NASA over 26,000 iPhones are in use by scientists, flight crew members, technicians and researchers.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><span>Turning to iPad, we sold </span>13.3<span> million units, compared to 14.6 million in the June quarter last year. iPad sales grew overall in the developing markets with particularly strong year-over-year growth in the Middle-East, where iPad sales were up 64%, in China where they grew 51%, and in India, where they were up 45%. This growth was more than offset by lower sales in more mature markets. We reduced iPad channel inventory by 500,000 from the end of the March quarter, which left us within our target range of four to six weeks.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><span>In the Enterprise, global companies are using iPad to improve customer service, boost work and productivity and enhance critical processes. iPad continues to be the standard for teams across the airline industry. Qantas Airlines has over 15,000 iPads deployed to pilots as well as cabin, customer service and ground crews to enhance key processes across the daily operations and governments are deploying thousands of iPads worldwide. One of the largest examples is Sweden, where over 100,000 iPads are being used by local government offices across the country.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><span>In education, iPad remains the tablet of choice with 85% share of the U.S. education tablet market according to the latest published estimate from IDC. We\u2019ve now sold 13 million iPads to education customers globally. We\u2019re bringing teachers and students great new tools to build an experience educational count into an iPad. As of this month, teachers using the free iTunes U app can create, edit and manage entire courses that are on iPad for the first time and students can discover new ways to collaborate, including the ability to start class discussions and ask questions right from their iPad.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><span>Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. We sold 4.4 million Macs, compared to under 3.8 million in the year ago quarter, an increase of 18% year-over-year and a new June quarter record. The increase was driven by portables, thanks to very strong growth of MacBook Air. We achieved strong double digit Mac growth across many countries, including the U.S. Canada, Mexico, the UK, Germany, France, Australia, China, India and the Middle-East. This growth is particularly impressive, given the contraction of the overall PC market. Macs have now gained global market share for 32 of the last 33 quarters.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><span>Macs performed well in the U.S. education buying season with double-digit growth in the K to 12 market, driven primarily by large deployments of MacBook Air. The Shawnee Mission School District in Kansas chose Apple to provide an entire solution that will equip every teacher with a MacBook Air and an iPad Air, every high school student with a MacBook Air and every middle school and elementary student with an iPad. The Rowan-Salisbury School System in North Carolina is deploying thousands of MacBook Airs to students and teachers in grades 9 to 12 as part of the district's digital learning initiatives.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><span>We ended the quarter with Mac channel inventory slightly below our four to five week target range. The Apple ecosystem continues to grow and thrive. Total revenue from iTunes software and services was $4.5 billion, an increase of 12% year-over-year. Our iTunes stores generated all time record billings of $5.4 billion in the June quarter, up 25% year-over-year, driven by very strong growth in App Store sales. These items billings translated to quarterly iTunes revenue of almost $2.6 billion, up 8% from the year ago quarter. Software and services revenue was $1.9 billion, up 19% from a year ago.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><span>App Store momentum remains very strong and cumulative app downloads has topped 75 billion. We continue be amazed by our vibrant and diverse developer community and we are extremely proud that our developers have now earned over 20 billion for sales of their apps through the App Store, nearly half of which have been earned in the past 12 months. This number truly stands out among our competition as our developers continue to benefit from the broad reach and powerful design of the App Store, coupled with Apple\u2019s large, loyal and very engaged customer base.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><span>Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $164.5 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $13.9 billion. Our domestic cash was $26.8 billion at the end of the June quarter, a sequential increase of $8.3 billion and $137.7 billion or 84% of our total cash was offshore. Cash flow from operations was $10.3 billion.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><span>We executed another very successful debt offering in April, issuing a total of 12 billion in notes across 3, 5, 7, 10 and 30 year maturities. In addition, during the quarter, we entered the commercial paper market for the first time with $2 billion in short-term obligations outstanding as of the end of June. We also continued to execute our shareholder return program with $8.3 billion of capital returned to inventors during the June quarter. We spent $5 billion to repurchase 59 million Apple shares to open market transactions. We paid almost $2.9 billion in dividends and equivalents and utilized over $400 million to net share settle vesting employee RSUs.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><span>We've now taken action on over $74 billion of our $130 billion capital return program, including $51 billion in share repurchases with six quarters remaining to its completion. And finally our Board has declared a dividend of $0.47 per common share payable on August 14, 2014 to shareholders of record as of record as of August 11, 2014.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><span>Now as we move ahead into September quarter, I\u2019d like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $37 billion and $40 billion, compared to $37.5 billion in the year ago quarter. We expect gross margin to between 37% and 38%. We expect OpEx to be between $4.75 billion and $4.85 billion. We expect OI&amp;E to be about $250 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 26.1%. Finally, we expect the Beats transaction to close this quarter and we expect the acquisition to be accreted to our earnings in our fiscal 2015.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><span>With that, let me open the call to questions.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span>Nancy Paxton</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><span>Thank you, Luca. And we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up please. Operator, may we have the first question.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span>Question-And-Answer Session</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span>Operator</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><span>(Operator Instructions). And your first question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span>Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><span>Luca, this is the third quarter in a row that gross margin came in above your guidance. Can you talk about what\u2019s driving that gap and why you expect the margin to come down sequentially in the September quarter?</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span>Luca Maestri</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><span>Yes, Katy, it was obviously a surprise also to us. We were expecting obviously a loss in leverage from the sequential declining revenue which obviously happened. We also expect that some unfavorable mix, which also happens -- it's typical as we move away from the launch quarter. And we were expecting some cost improvements. These cost improvements came in. They came in stronger than we were anticipating. The commodity markets continue to be favorable, the product quality continues to be excellent, our teams executed really, really well. And all these things came together at the same time and it was a very nice surprise for us. As we look forward into Q4, yes, we\u2019ve guided to 37% to 38%. Again, the mix is the normal mix that we see as we continue to move through the product cycle. And obviously in Q4, we got some transition costs because we\u2019re expecting a very busy fall. We're bit excited about what we've got in the pipeline. And that\u2019s the reason why we guided to that range.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span>Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><span>And then just a follow-up on that last point, because in the press release you referenced the excitement about new products and services. Can you remind us of your guidance philosophy as it relates to product cycles? Do you embed assumptions around the contribution from new products? And if so, do those tend to be more conservative than for products that\u2019s already shipped today?</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span>Luca Maestri</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><span>So our guidance, Katy is that -- we put our numbers that we believe at this point in time with all the information that is available to us, we're going to land within. So we take into account the fact that we\u2019ve seen some purchase delays for executing Q3, but we have seen some safe trends in certain geographies. That continues to happen. And what you see this quarter is that our guidance range is $3 billion, as opposed to $2 billion during the third quarter, just to take into account the fact that we got many moving pieces.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span>Nancy Paxton</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><span>Thank you Katy. Can we have the next question please?</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span>Operator</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><span>From Goldman Sachs, we will hear from Bill Shope.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span>Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><span>With the pockets of market we just noted for tablets, could you give us some more detail on how you are thinking about the category longer term, and in particular in the context of your usage comments, how are you thinking about the competitive landscape now and how that may evolve? And then I guess, related to that, what do you think to be the next driver of renewed growth for the category?</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span>Tim Cook</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><span>It\u2019s Tim. If you sort of back up from this, the category that we created, which has just been a little over four years, we have now sold 225 million iPads, which is I think probably a larger number than anyone would have predicted at the time and including ourselves, quite frankly. We still feel that category as a whole is in its early days and that there is also significant innovation that can be brought to the iPad and we plan on doing that. When I look at the top level numbers, I get really excited when I see that more than 50% of the iPads that we're selling are going to someone who is a first time tablet buyer. I get excited when I see that our retail share according to the MPD in the month of June was 59% of UNIX and over 70% in terms of dollars. And of course, Luca has mentioned in his preamble that our education share is 85%.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><span>We also are in the -- virtually all Fortune 500 companies, we are in 99% of them to be exact and 93% of the Global 500. However, when we dig into the business market deeper, though our market share in the U.S., in the commercial sector is good at 76% -- this is according to IDC; the penetration in business is low. It\u2019s only 20%. And to put that in some kind of context, if you looked at penetration of notebooks in business, it would be over 60%. And so we think that there is a substantial upside in business. And this was one of the thinkings behind the partnership with IBM that we announced last week. We think that the core thing that unleashes this is a better go to market, which IBM clearly brings to the table, but even more importantly apps that are written with Mobile First in mind. Not all but many of the enterprises apps that have been written for iPad have been essentially ports from a desktop arrangement and haven\u2019t taken full advantage of mobile.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><span>And so we're excited about bringing that to business along with partnering with IBM, which we think is a first class company. And seeing what that can do to sales of business, which I honestly believe the opportunity is huge. The market is still predicted in 2018 -- I think these are Gartner numbers -- to be about 350 million in size and put that in some context, I think the PC market right now is about 315 million.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><span>And so I think our theory that has been there honestly since the first time that we shipped iPad, that the tablet market would eventually surpass the PC market, that theory is still intact. I just think we have to do some more things to get the business side of it moving in a faster trajectory and I think we're now on to something that can really do that. So as I look at it and sort of back up from the 90 day clock kind of thing, I'm incredibly excited. I'm excited about the plans that we have on the product side and also on the go to market side, and in particular the IBM announcement.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><span>One other point I might add on this, because I think this is interesting. I don\u2019t think it came out in our commentary so far as; the market's very bifurcated on iPad. In the BRIC countries, iPad did extremely well. The growth was very high. Like in the China it was in the 50%s, in the Middle East it was in the 60%s. Luca may have mentioned those numbers. In the developed countries like the U.S., the market is clearly weaker there. It\u2019s interesting to note however that the U.S. as an example, we had a very, very strong Macintosh market in the U.S. and so there is probably a bit of higher add kind of stuff beginning to play out too, where higher add is clearly still very much notebook oriented. K12 on the other hand, we sell 2.5 iPads for every Mac in the K12. And so we're clearly headed into that season now and it typically starts in graduation time prime in fiscal Q3 for us. And so I think that\u2019s probably another thing that we're seeing.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span>Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><span>One more question if I could. You've had obviously great performance in the BRIC countries and you've touched on China for few categories. Can you talk about the overall demand environment you saw for China in the quarter? Obviously there's some seasonal factors to consider but how should we think about your performance versus your expectations and how you are thinking about it for the rest of the calendar year?</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span>Tim Cook</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><span>China, honestly was surprising to us that it was -- we thought it would be strong but it well went past what we thought. We came in at 26% of revenue growth, including retail and if you look at the units, the unit growth was really off the charts across the board. I found 48% off that compares to a market estimate of 24%. So growing it two times the market. iPad was up as well, as I've mentioned before. The Mac was up 39% and that\u2019s versus a market in China that\u2019s also contracting along with markets in most parts of the world and China was projected to contract by 5%. And so we're seeing some substantial strength there and the thing that\u2019s actually growing the most is the iTunes software and services category, which has the App Store and et cetera and that area is almost doubling year-over-year.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><span>And so it\u2019s very, very exciting what we're seeing there. We are still in the process of rolling out along with our partner China Mobile, the TD-LTE into more cities and we're still in early going on that. That just started in January as you know. And my understanding is that later this year there will be a license for the other operators to begin shipping FDD-LTE, which I think is another big opportunity in China.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span>Nancy Paxton</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><span>Thank you, Bill. Could we have the next question please?</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span>Operator</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><span>Next we'll go to Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span>Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><span>I have one for Luca and one for Tim please. Luca, I wanted to revisit the gross margin question. You talked about guidance for next quarter, that the drivers of the sequential decline being a normal mix through the cycle on transition cost. Your guidance to the midpoint is down 190 basis points in gross margin, last year in Q4 gross margins were up 10 basis points sequentially in fiscal Q4 and the product transition issues or cycle issues that you alluded to seem essentially identical. So I'd like to try and understand what might make this Q4 different let\u2019s say than last Q4?</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span>Luca Maestri</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><span>If I understand the question, also when you look at it in terms of absolute levels of gross margin, last year it was 37%. So our range is above that level. There is obviously many, many things that affect us in different ways from one year to the other. Foreign exchange is a case where a lot of the emerging market currencies and the yen and the Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar, they have been weaker against the U.S. dollar. That has an impact on margin. And also when you think our product cycle, I think we don\u2019t get into the specifics but this is not exactly the same cycle as we've had a year ago.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span>Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><span>I mean is it better? If we look back two years to the iPhone 5, your product margins were down 260 basis points sequentially. So is the reference there that we should be thinking in terms of changes that are more akin to what we saw two years ago rather than to this year?</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span>Luca Maestri</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><span>I wouldn\u2019t necessarily draw that analogy. I think we need to start thinking from the fact that we had a very, very strong Q3. A lot of things came together extremely well. 37% to 38% is a range that is -- we think is very good, and that\u2019s where we are right now and we still have several weeks in the quarter.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span>Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><span>Tim, I wanted to get your input on the impact of trade-in programs for the iPhone, particularly in mature markets where they are most prevalent. As best I can tell, if I look at the last four quarters, they're not hyper-focused on 90 days. It looks like the iPhone has been about flat in unit terms in the Americas and up low single digits in Europe and I think Europe includes India, which is obviously very fast growing. So perhaps low single digits in Europe. So if we look at those western geographies, we've seen relatively flattish iPhone unit sales over the last year. I know you don\u2019t report it but just sort of based on overall revenue reporting, I'm wondering if you can comment on what you're seeing in terms of iPhone trade-in programs and this is four quarters, still over a complete cycle. Whether you think they are elongating or shrinking and what impact is very prevalent, increasingly prevalent trade-in programs might be having on them and what impact your pricing of older generation devices might be having on them.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span>Tim Cook</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><span>Yes, the theory that you have Toni is not precisely correct. Like if I look at Europe, the operating segment of Europe for quarter or year-to-date for 2014 versus the same period last year, iPhone units were actually up 10%. Your more macro question; what I understand to be your macro question of do I think there is some sort of cannibalization going on trade-in programs on new product sales? What I think is happening in the aggregate if you look across the world is that trade-ins are actually hugely beneficial for our ecosystem because people wind up -- we have more people that are able to join the party when we have a trade-in, because in essence, it winds up being used by -- probably the prime example someone else within the family or in the example that has become more common in the last year, someone trades it in and then that goes to either somebody else in that country that is very price sensitive or somebody in a different country and I see all of this as good.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><span>In looking at how much of it cannibalizes, it is very hard to answer that question with any degree of preciseness. But my gut is that the cannibalization factor is low, because you wind up having -- you wind up attracting people that are much more price sensitive in there. I think the great thing is that our products command a much higher resale value than others do. And so that leads to a larger trade-in and from my perspective, that being the larger ecosystem, more people that wind up getting on iPhone, and as you know from following us for quite some time, if we get somebody to try an Apple product and then buy an Apple product, the likelihood that they begin buying other Apple products that may be in different categories or upgrading to one in that category and the future is very high. And so net-net, I view it to be positive. It\u2019s very difficult to quantify with certainty.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span>Nancy Paxton</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><span>Thank you, Toni. Could we have the next question please?</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span>Operator</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><span>From UBS, we will hear from Steve Milunovich.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span>Steve Milunovich - UBS</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><span>Tim you mentioned that Japan was fairly flat due to regulations and taxes. Could you elaborate on that and what kind of comparisons perhaps you see going forward?</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span>Tim Cook</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><span>Yes, it was actually Luca, but I can comment on it. VAT was increased from 5% to 8% close to the beginning of the quarter. I think it was actually April 1 or so. That was the first planned VAT increase. There are other or at least one additional planned VAT increase in the future. This was a part of the overall tax reform package in Japan. Secondly, the carriers received some guidance from the regulators to essentially stop incenting people to transfer from another carrier at a higher amount than they were incenting their -- retaining their own customers. And so it appears that the combination of these two things dampened the whole market for smartphones in Japan.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><span>We haven\u2019t been able to get very detailed data on share but my expectation is we're not going to see very much of a share change. And we are beginning to see some coming back of that market as we step into this quarter, may be not back to the level that it was previously but you can begin to see the market growing again which we view as very positive. In the past when we've seen these type of things, tax changes et cetera, there is usually a rush to buy before the tax increase, a pause that happens thereafter and then the market eventually goes back to some kind of steady state that may not be exactly where it was but it nears it. And so I think that\u2019s likely our guts or that\u2019s what happens on the VAT side. The other piece is a little harder to conclude what will happen in terms of that guidance and how long that might be employed. I don\u2019t know that part.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span>Steve Milunovich - UBS</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><span>Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And then you talked about your three tiers of iPhones. I wonder if you would be willing to breakout in any more detail the growth and particularly how to defend the 5C in the mid-tier. I know our surveys continue to find in the U.S. that it's falling little bit as a percentage of business but you seem to believe it\u2019s doing exactly what you expected it to do.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span>Tim Cook</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><span>I can tell you this. That if you look at the growth rates, we don\u2019t divide out each one but if you look at year-over-year growth rates and so this would be comparing the 5C to last year. It would be comparing the 4S, which was in the mid-tier. The growth in that sector was the highest growth during the quarter we just finished.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span>Steve Milunovich - UBS</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><span>Of the three tiers?</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span>Tim Cook</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><span>Of the three tiers. And so we are extremely happy with how it performed last quarter.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span>Nancy Paxton</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><span>Thanks Steve. Can we have the next question please?</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span>Operator</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><span>Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span>Kulbinder Garcha - Credit Suisse</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><span>Thanks. I have just one question for Luca and one for Tim. And for Luca, you mentioned that commodity pricing, I guess the environment was good for you. Is it your working assumption in your guidance that continued to be favorable and a tailwind for you? And then my question for Tim is, with the installment plans that are being introduced in the U.S., I imagine that given the increases in flexibility for people to operate faster, would you expect that to happen? Are you seeing any evidence as these contests come up because we've had them out now for several months? And how do you see that impacting your business because obviously the U.S. iPhone part of your business is still very significant and it can be quite a big catalyst to your iPhone business going forward I would imagine or would you be more tensed in how these are playing out?</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span>Tim Cook</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><span>I will take both of these. This is Tim. On the component question, what we saw in the June quarter was that NAND, mobile DRAM and LCD, the pricing on all of those declined, while PC DRAM increased, despite the market for PCs contracting. In the September quarter, what is factored in our guidance is that LCDs and mobile DRAM continue to decline, that NAND pricing remains essentially flat last quarter and that PC DRAM has a slight price increase. And in terms of other commodities that I didn\u2019t talk about, we've assumed that they would decline at historical rates and so that\u2019s factored into the gross margin guidance that Luca gave you. In terms of the installment plans that you mentioned in the U.S. relative to iPhone, there is a lot of different models that are being tried in the U.S. and throughout the world. And actually last quarter, as we estimated and this is subject to estimating but we're estimating that less than one out of four iPhones were sold on a traditional subsidy plan. And so that number is markedly different than it would have been two years ago.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><span>The installment plan that you're speaking about which gives the customer the right to upgrade SAP or faster than a usual two year cycle, we think that plays to our customer base in a large way. And so that makes us incredibly bullish that customers on those plans would be very likely to upgrade when we announce a new product.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span>Nancy Paxton</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><span>Thank you, Kulbinder. May we have a next question please?</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span>Operator</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><span>Next we'll hear from Ben Reitzes with Barclays.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span>Ben Reitzes - Barclays</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><span>Thanks a lot. Tim, questions for you. I guess during the quarter you did two very big things in our opinion, obviously buying Beats, biggest acquisition in your history and you also did this IBM deal, which obviously was in this quarter, but since the last call, and that was very interesting, obviously really collaborating with another huge company to get further into the enterprise. And I was just wondering, what are you seeing in Apple that\u2019s changing? These seem like big deals that change your direction a bit, something that you wouldn\u2019t have done in the past. And do you see a lot more partnerships and larger acquisitions on the horizon to grow your TAM in various markets?</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span>Tim Cook</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><span>Well, I think we have a lot of really great people and I think we have the capability. As I've said before, I think we have the capability to acquire a sizable company and manage it. And relative to IBM, I feel the same way. I think you can only do so many partnerships well, and so it is unusual that we enter into a partnership. But in this particular case, I think arguably the companies are so complementary, and I've gotten to know Gini fairly well over the last couple of years and I think we see the importance of the customer, a lot of the same way and both feel that Mobile and Enterprise is just an enormous opportunity. And we\u2019re not competing with each other. And so I think a partnership in that case is particularly great. Would we do more of either of the things we did? We\u2019re always looking in the acquisition space, but we don\u2019t let our money burn a hole in our pocket and we don\u2019t do things that aren\u2019t strategic.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><span>And so with Beats we felt we were getting an incredible subscription service, a very rare set of talent that we think can do great things in Apple and access to a very fast growing businesses in their headphone and earphone space. And culturally we felt there was a match and music has been deeply embedded in Apple\u2019s DNA for many, many years. And so it was a great marriage and I think the partnership with IBM is a great marriage as well. It\u2019s more like that, presented themselves -- or I think we can manage more things. I think that we have a very, very strong executive team and can do that. But it\u2019s not my goal to acquire certain number of companies or spend a certain amount of money. We want to do things that help us make great products that are great for our customers and so forth.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span>Ben Reitzes - Barclays</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><span>I am sorry, just really quick on the IBM. Does this say something about Apple doing more in Big Data, and taking a cut maybe of some of the analytics opportunities as well?</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span>Tim Cook</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><span>Yes, we didn\u2019t talk about how the business model is going to work. But generally speaking, I think that each of us have revenue streams in the enterprise and each of us went from having those revenue streams. So that\u2019s how I look at that. And we win if we can drive that penetration number I spoke about from 20% to 60%. That would be incredibly exciting here. The walls would shake. And so that\u2019s what I hope for.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span>Nancy Paxton</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><span>Thank you Ben. Could we have the next question please?</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span>Operator</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><span>We will hear from Ben Schachter with Macquarie.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span>Ben Schachter - Macquarie</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><span>Tim, I just wanted to talk about the app market for Enterprise. Right now I believe that app developers can sell to the enterprise directly and therefore that they can bypass sharing revenue from these app sales with Apple. Is Apple going to allow that to continue, and can you also just more broadly discuss how Apple thinks about the opportunity to sell apps directly to the enterprise?</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span>Tim Cook</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><span>We have no plans to change the rules with Enterprise. Some enterprises like proprietary apps that they do not want to offer to others and so we obviously have a way for them to distribute those into their enterprise or just the employees that they want to and so I'm not worried about changing that. We\u2019re also taking friction out of the system and not adding it. Again, the big thing for us is getting the penetration number, I think getting our product, iPhones and iPads and Macs in more people hands and we think there is a huge opportunity in Enterprise to do that.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span>Nancy Paxton</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><span>Thank you Ben.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><span>At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong><span>Nancy Paxton</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><span>Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks everyone for joining us today. Speaking first today is Apple's CEO, Tim Cook; and he will be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri, and after some final remarks we'll open the call for questions from analysts.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><span>Please note that some of the information you\u2019ll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margins, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes and future products.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><span>Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast.

Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><span>And I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong><span>Tim Cook</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><span>Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon, everyone and thanks for joining us. Since we spoke in July, it's been an exciting and very busy time, so we have lots of great things to talk about today.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><span>Just last month, we launched the biggest advancements in iPhone's history with iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. These iPhones are the best we have ever created and customers absolutely love them.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><span>Our operational team has done an extraordinary job executing the manufacturing ramp throughout the entire supply chain. Today we've launched in 32 countries including China and our new iPhones will be shifting in 69 countries and territories by the end of this month, making this our fastest and most successful iPhone launch ever.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><span>Demand for the new iPhones has been staggering and geographically broad-based markedly higher in every single country where we've launched compared to the iPhone 5s a year ago.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><span>We're working hard to fill orders as fast as possible and we're on track to be in more than 115 countries by the end of December.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><span>Last month we introduced two new categories; the first is Apple Pay, an entirely new way to pay for things in stores and in apps. It makes mobile payments easier, more secure and more private. Apple Pay went live today and now making purchases and participating stores happens with just a touch of a finger.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><span>Paying within apps is as easy as selecting Apple Pay and placing a finger on Touch ID. Today Apple Pay supports credit and debit cards from the three major payment networks and the top U.S. banks and over 500 additional banks have signed on and will be supporting Apple Pay beginning this year and early next year. Apple Pay is being supported by many of the nation's top retailers and we continue to sign more retailers.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><span>The second new category is Apple Watch, our most personal device ever and one that has already captured the world's imagination. We can't wait to get Apple Watch to customers beginning in early calendar 2015. We'll be providing more details on Apple Watch as we get closer to the shipment day.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><span>Last week we launched the new iPad Air 2 and iPad Mini 3 with innovations that make them dramatically better than previous generation and the stunning new iMac with a Retina 5K display.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><span>We released iOS 8 last month and our customers are enjoying new ways to use their iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch with intuitive new features and groundbreaking security.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><span>Last week, we also released OS X Yosemite, with an all new design and continuity features that deliver an even more fluid experience across all of our iOS devices and Mac.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><span>These introductions reflect years of innovation and hard work by teams all across Apple and they demonstrate the seamless integration of hardware, software and services that provides unparallel user experiences for our customers. These are things that only Apple can do.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><span>We've also communicated and demonstrated our commitment to respecting and protecting users' privacy with strong encryption and strict policies that govern how our data is handled.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><span>Today we're also reporting very strong results for Apple's fourth fiscal quarter. We generated our strongest revenue growth rate in seven quarters far surpassing our expectations we communicated in July and establishing a new record for Apple's September quarter revenue.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><span>We're also reporting gross margin of 38% compared to 37% last year, leading to a very strong EPS growth of 20%. Fueled by the launch of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus and strong demand for our previous iPhone models, we set a new September quarter record for iPhone with revenue growth of 21% year-over-year.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><span>Demand for iPhone was strong across all geographies with global unit sell-through growth of 26% and we exited the quarter with significant backlog for both iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><span>We established an all-time quarterly record for Mac sales with revenue growing 18% year-over-year, thanks in particular to the very strong performance of our portables.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><span>We're especially proud of our Mac results considering the overall contraction of the global PC market this year and we achieved our highest quarterly market share since 1995.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><span>We also set an all-time record for the App Store revenue, thanks to the tremendous momentum and ongoing success of our developer community. App Store revenue grew 36% over last year and cumulative app downloads have now topped 85 billion.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><span>These results bring to a close a record breaking fiscal 2014. Over the last four quarters, our products and services have generated a $183 billion in revenues, an increase of $12 billion over last year. We sold 243 million iOS devices and 19 million Macs, both all-time highs.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><span>Our revenue from iTunes software and services reached $18 billion, which was more than the annual sales of two thirds of the companies in the Fortune 500 and we generated $6.45 in earnings per share, which is 14% higher than last year and also set a new record.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><span>We made big investments in our business and have continued to expand our global footprint. Today we have 437 Apple retail stores in 15 countries and our partners are selling Apple products in hundreds of thousands of locations around the world.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><span>We're continuing to invest in developing markets where revenues approached $50 million in fiscal year '14, up 16% over last year and twice the rate of growth of the company overall.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><span>We [forged] (ph) a landmark partnership with IBM to provide a new generation of mobile enterprise application designed with our products legendary ease of use and backed by IBM's cloud services and data analytics.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><span>Our partnership aims to redefine the way work is done, address key industry mobility challenges and sparked true mobile-led business change.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><span>Developer teams have been working closely to develop the first wave of Mobile First solutions and these solutions will be ready for customers beginning next month across six sectors; banking, government, insurance, retail, travel and transportation and telecommunication.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"><span>We brought tremendous new talent and technology into Apple through 20 acquisitions in fiscal '14 including seven alone in the September quarter. We closed the Beats transition in July and we're off to a great start with some wonderful plans we'll share with you in the future.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"><span>Our strong results continue to generate significant cash and we're extremely happy that this has enabled us to make substantial investments in Apple's future, while retaining -- while returning cash to our shareholders.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"><span>We had executed aggressively against our share repurchase program, spending $17 billion in the September quarter alone and $45 billion in the last year.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"><span>In addition to Apple's strong business performance over the past four quarters, I am incredibly proud of all of our work to protect the environment, to advance human rights, to improve working conditions in the supply chain and to change the way teachers teach and students learn.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"><span>I'd like to thank all of our customers, employees, developers and business partners for making fiscal 2014 Apple's best year yet and I'd like to thank all of our shareholders for their continued support. I could not be more excited about the road ahead in fiscal 2015.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"><span>With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Luca to discuss our September quarter results in more detail.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"><strong><span>Luca Maestri</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"><span>Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. During the September quarter we generated record revenue of $42.1 billion, an increase $4.7 billion or 12% year-over-year. These results exceeded our guidance range due to better than expected sales of iPhones and Macs for which customer demand grew strongly year-over-year in all our segments.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"><span>Gross margin was 38% at the high end of the guidance range, operating margin was $11.2 billion representing 26.5% of revenue. Net income was $8.5 billion, a new September quarter record translating to diluted earnings per share of $1.42, a 20% year-over-year increase. Cash flow from operations was very strong, a $13.3 billion, also a new Q4 record.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"><span>For details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 39.3 million iPhones, an increase of 5.5 million over last year or 16% growth. Underlying demand was even stronger with sell-through growth of 26%.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"><span>iPhone sales grew across both developed and emerging markets. Unit sales in the U.S. grew 17% year-over-year, and in Western Europe they were up 20%. We saw even stronger growth in Latin America and the Middle East with sales up more than 50% and in Central and Eastern Europe where sales more than doubled.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"><span>We increased iPhone channel inventory by just under one million units during the September quarter this year, significantly less than the 3.3 million unit increase in the September quarter a year ago.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"><span>Based on the very strong demand for our new iPhones, this left us below our target range of four to six weeks for channel inventory on a look forward basis.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"><span>iPhone momentum in enterprise market remains very strong. The latest data published by IDC indicates that iPhone have 69% share of the U.S. commercial smartphone market.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"><span>Also, In August ChangeWave survey of U.S. corporate IT buyers found that among those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter 75% plan to purchase iPhones. An iPhone continues to fuel innovation of companies around the world.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"><span>Schindler, a leading global escalator and elevator manufacturer has deployed over 20,000 iPhones and 20 customer apps to improve customer engagements for safety and to allow service technicians to access vital documentation, repair and safety functions when they are in the field.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"><span>Baidu, </span>China's<span> top search provider currently has over 20,000 employees using iPhones and the company has developed over 30 in-house iOS apps to help its employees work more efficiently, track sales leads and manage internal IT infrastructure and processes.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><span>Next, I would like to talk about the Mac. We sold 5.5 million Macs, an increase of almost a million over last year. That represents 21% growth year-over-year and an all-time quarterly record. We saw great demand in the back-to-school season for both desktops and portables with especially strong growth for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><span>We achieved double-digit Mac growth across most markets around the world, with particularly impressive performance in emerging markets where Mac sales were up 46%.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><span>These results are truly remarkable given the contraction in the global PC market and we now gain market share for 33 of the last 34 quarters. We ended the quarter with Mac channel inventory slightly below our four to five week target range.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><span>Turning to iPad, we sold 12.3 million units compared to 14.1 million in the September quarter last year. In anticipation of our October new product announcement we reduced iPad channel inventory by 500,000 from the end of the June quarter, which left us within our target range of channel inventory on a look-back basis.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><span>iPad sales were consistent with our expectations and we experienced very strong results in Japan where iPad sales were up 46% year-over-year. Customers continue to love their iPads. In an August survey by ChangeWave iPad Mini with retina display earned an incredible 100% satisfaction rate, and among consumers planning to purchase a tablet within 90 days, the survey indicated a 55% plan to buy an iPad.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><span>We continue to see some momentum in enterprise for iPad. Progressive IT organizations around the world continue to deploy, manage and develop amazing in-house apps for iPad.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><span>Healthcare leader Sanofi has over 25,000 iPads and over 450 in-house apps for sales teams and corporate employees to get their products and information into the hands of doctors and other healthcare providers.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><span>Premium eyewear designer Luxottica has deployed over 10,000 iPads to improve how customers experience the size, fit and overall look of eyewear in a retail environment. Importantly, since the announcement of the partnership with IBM hundreds of corporations around the world have expressed interest in MobileFirst solutions and we are actively working with over 50 of them to become foundational client for MobileFirst solutions in their industries.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><span>iPad continues to lead the U.S. education tablet market with 90% share based on the latest data from IDC. In the September quarter the St. Paul public school in Minnesota purchased over 22,000 iPad Airs and over 5,000 iPad Minis in the first race of the district's personalized learning through technology plan that will ultimately equip every student with an iPad.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><span>We are fully consistent and continue to strive. Our item store generated all time record billings of $5.4 billion in the September quarter, up 22% year-over-year, thanks to the tremendous momentum of the app store. Developers around the world have embraced the iOS platform and keep broadening the appeal of our thoughtfully designed app store to a large, loyal and engaged customer base.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><span>Across all of our programs the number of registered app developers has grown by 22% in the last year and we are rapidly approaching 10 million. We are seeing especially strong interest in the enterprise with a number of registered developers is up 39% over a year ago.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><span>Our retail stores also generated strong results. Revenue for the quarter was $5.1 billion, up 15% from a year ago and a new September quarter record. We opened 10 new stores and completed the remodels of three stores during the quarter ending with a total of 437 stores, 41% of which are outside the United States.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><span>We are projecting a total of approximately 25 new store openings in fiscal '15, about three quarters of which will be outside the U.S. We also plan to remodel about five stores over the course of the year.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><span>With an average of 432 stores opened in the September quarter average revenue per store was $11.9 million compared to $10.9 million in the year ago quarter. We hosted 102 million visitors to our stores during the quarter, which translates to over 18,000 visitors per store per week.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><span>Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $155.2 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential decline of $9.3 billion. We are continue to execute our capital return program aggressively with the total spend of over $20 billion in just the September quarter.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><span>We launched our fourth accelerated share repurchase program at the end of August spending $9 billion. We also spent $8 billion to repurchase $81 million Apple's shares to open market transactions, paid $2.8 billion in dividends and equivalence and utilized over $300 million to net share sell vesting employee RSUs.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><span>So, we've already taken action on over $94 billion of our $130 billion capital return program including $68 billion in share repurchases with five quarters remaining to its completion. We remained firmly committed to our objective of delivering attractive returns to shareholders through both business performance and return of capital.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><span>As we said before, we review our capital allocation regularly. We have solicited feedback on our capital return program from shareholders in the past and we will continue to do so. We plan to report on our conclusions in a timeframe similar to last year.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><span>Now, as we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $63.5 billion and $66.5 billion compared to $57.6 billion in the year ago quarter.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><span>This represents a double-digit revenue increase despite significant foreign exchange headwinds from the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most currencies. We expect gross margin to be between 37.5% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $5.4 billion and $5.5 billion. We expect OI&amp;E to be about $325 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 26.5%.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><span>Also today our Board has declared a dividend of $0.47 per common share payable on November 13, 2014, to shareholders of record as of November 10, 2014.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><span>With that, I will hand it over to Nancy for some final remarks.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span>Nancy Paxton</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><span>Thanks, Luca. We'd like to let you know about some reporting changes that we'll be making beginning with the release of our Q1 '15 results.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><span>First, to better serve our customers and optimize our results around the world we are collaborating like never before across our direct and indirect channels.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><span>Accordingly, beginning in Q1 '15, we'll be including the results of our retail stores in the geographic segments where the stores are located providing a consolidated view of regional performance that is consistent with the way our executive team measures the business.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><span>This means that going forward our reportable segment will be Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and the rest of Asia-Pacific with the retail no longer classified as a segment.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><span>Second, to better reflect our evolving products and services, we'll be making some changes to our product summary reporting. We will continue to report iPhone, iPad and Macs as separate line items and we'll also have a category that we refer to as services and this will encompass everything we report under the heading of iTunes software and services today including content, apps, licensing and other services and beginning this month it will also include Apple Pay.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><span>We'll be creating a new reporting category called other products. This will encompass everything we report in the accessories category today including Beats headphones and speakers, Apple TV and peripherals and accessories for iPhone, iPad, Mac and iPod.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><span>In addition, we will begin to include iPod sales in the other products category and we will also reflect sales of Apple Watch in this line item once it begins shipping in early calendar 2015.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><span>So to recap, beginning in Q1 '15. our products reporting categories will be iPhone, iPad, Mac, services and other products. We wanted to give analysts and investors a heads up on these plans so you can reflect them in your models accordingly.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><span>We'll also reclassify historical results to be consistent with these newer groupings and we'll provide that information on our Investor Relations website when we release Q1 results.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><span>And finally, our distribution channels have evolved and expanded significantly in the last couple of years including traditional resellers, consumer electronic stores, mass retailers, distributors and carriers, and each of these channels have the different distribution model. Today, iPhone is sold in over 200,000 locations around the world and iPad is sold in more than 100,000.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><span>In addition, revenue from emerging markets has increased considerably over the last few years and now accounts for over quarter of our sales. And channel inventory requirements in those markets tend to be much longer.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><span>So, due to the size, complexity and different needs of our channels around the world we've determined that a five to seven week average range for both iPhone and iPad channel inventory is more appropriate and that will be our target range going forward. However, given the backlog for our new products, we expect to exit the December quarter within our old four to six weeks target range.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><span>So with that let's open the call to questions and we ask that you please limit yourself to one one-part question and one follow-up.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span>Question-and-Answer Session</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span>Operator</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><span>(Operator Instructions) Your first question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span>Shannon Cross - Cross Research</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><span>Thank you very much. Good afternoon. My first question is with regard to Apple Pay, which we actually used this afternoon and where it was rolled out it actually worked pretty well which was nice, but could you provide some more color, Tim and Luca, on how you see the business model for Apple?</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><span>And maybe from a high level perspective, if you see there's more over time becoming a standalone business like you look at iTunes, or is this more just a way to sell incremental product?</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span>Tim Cook</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><span>Shannon, hi, it's Tim. The -- what we wanted to achieve with Apple Pay was first and foremost to have an incredible consumer experience. And so we focused very much on making it elegant and simple and hopefully your trails have proven them. I know I used it over the weekend and it worked fantastically.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><span>We also wanted to focus on security and privacy, and so we see huge issues with the security of the traditional credit card system. And many people that have entered mobile payments are doing still in a way that they want to monetize the data that they collect from the customers and we think customers in general do not want this that they'd like to keep their data private. And so, we wanted to have ease of use, security and privacy and maximize all three.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><span>By doing so, we think we will sell more devices because we think it's a killer feature. It's far better than reaching in your pocket book and trying to find the card that you're looking for and half the time it's not working.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><span>There -- we do not charge the customer for the benefit. We do not charge the merchant for the benefit. However, there are commercial terms between Apple and the issuing banks, but we're not disclosing what they are, like any other contractual arrangement those are private things.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><span>And so as Nancy was saying in her closing comments, we'll be reporting Apple Pay in the services line item on the data sheet. And so, we see it as an incredible service that is the most customer-centric mobile payment system that there is. And we are very proud of it and can't wait to sign up more retailers and also extend it around the world.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span>Shannon Cross - Cross Research</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><span>Thank you. And then, Luca, if you could talk a little bit about the impact of currency. In IBM's results this morning they talked substantially about potential pressure going forward from currency. So could you walk us through how your hedges work, how we should think about currency and how you reflected in at least the current quarter guidance?</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span>Luca Maestri</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><span>Yeah. Definitely, Shannon. As you know, the U.S. dollar has strengthened quite significantly against most currencies in recent weeks. When we looked at our Q4 results actually the impact was fairly limited combination of the hedging program and the fact that the dollar really strengthened towards the very end of the quarter.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><span>Not much impact in Q4. It is becoming a significant headwind in Q1 both on a year-over-year basis and on a sequential basis.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><span>As I said before, we have reflected the new FX situation at current levels into our guidance that we provided for both revenue and gross margins. And it's a fact of life if the U.S. dollar strengthens, that creates a headwind for us both in revenue and margins for our business outside the United States.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><span>As you know, we have a comprehensive hedging program in place that mitigates the impact of foreign exchange. Over time, of course, these hedges roll off and get replaced by new hedges at new spot levels, and so the protection that you get from hedging program is temporary. But again, the guidance that we provided fully reflects that current situation in the FX markets.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span>Shannon Cross - Cross Research</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><span>Thank you.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span>Nancy Paxton</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><span>Thanks Shannon, can we have the next question please?</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span>Operator</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><span>And from Goldman Sachs we'll hear from Bill Shope.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span>Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><span>Okay. Thank you. Could you comment on how we should think about the key swing factors for gross margins in the December quarter, obviously outside the FX impact you just mentioned, Luca?</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><span>And more broadly, I know it's still early, but how should we think about the gross margin path as the iPhone 6 family ramps versus what we saw with the 5S and 5C cycle. I guess you can answer that specifically. I'm trying to figure out if you characterize this as a fairly normal cycle in terms of expected cost improvements over the life of the product.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span>Luca Maestri</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><span>Yes, Bill let me start with put and takes of margins for Q1. I would say that on the positive we are so pleased with the launch of new phones you might have seen phenomenal. So we think we're going to be getting favorable impact from iPhone mix.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><span>Of course, we're also going to be getting some positive leverage from the higher revenues that we guided to and we continue to see fairly favorable commodity environment. So these are the things that are on the positive side.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><span>On the negative side I've talked about FX. Obviously we have launched a lot of new products even in the last six weeks and we've got transition costs as we move from current products to new products and that tends to be a headwind.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><span>And every time we launch new products, we make them better and what that means is that our cost structures tend to go up when we produce new products. We have a very good track record of taking those cost structures down over time and so when you take the positives and negatives that I have just mentioned that is what gives us the guidance that we just provided.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span>Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><span>Okay great. And then my second question is, looking at that current supply constraints of the iPhone, could you confirm that your guidance is assuming you will reach supply demand balance before the end of the quarter, I think that's what was implied by your commentary on channel inventory?</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><span>And related to that, could you give us some more color on what you see as the key bottlenecks at this point for supply on the iPhone side?</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span>Tim Cook</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><span>Bill its Tim. The ramp itself is going great. The chances are ever in our history, so I couldn\u2019t be happier with it. That said, today demand is far obstructing supply. It is unclear looking at the data when supply will catch up with demand.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><span>And so I don\u2019t want to leave you with a view that we know that we're going to get to a supply-demand balance on both of the new products this quarter because I don\u2019t know that at this point.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><span>It's very difficult to gauge demand without first achieving finding the balance and it's clear that as of today, and certainly as of the end of the quarter where you're looking at the data, we're not nearly, we're not close, we're not on the same plan.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><span>And -- but that said, I am really confident that supply is going to be great and that's the reason you see incredibly strong guidance that we're giving from $63.5 billion to $66.5 billion.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><span>At -- but at this point, it's just very difficult to gauge what the true demand is. When you see it's very unusual to see every country having a marked improvement over the previous year and that's what we're seeing on iPhone.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><span>And so, I couldn\u2019t be happier with the way the demand looks. Nancy's comment at the end was meant to tell you that we do not envision as of today being able to achieve the extra inventory in the channel that we believe is needed when you think about the long food chains in some of the emerging markets where the distribution channels are not as official, so that's the purpose of that comment.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span>Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><span>Okay, that's helpful, thank you.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span>Tim Cook</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><span>Yes.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span>Nancy Paxton</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><span>Thanks Bill. Can we have the next question please?</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span>Operator</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><span>We'll hear from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span>Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><span>Thanks. Luca I wonder if you can quantify the currency headwind on gross margin in the December quarter, just because there is a big focus on currency across tech right now and should we expect price harmonization if the dollar remained strong? And then I have a follow-up.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span>Luca Maestri</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><span>Katy, it's you know I said that there's headwinds from foreign exchange are going to be significant. So -- and I would tell you that they are more significant when you look at it from a year-over-year basis that it is on a sequential basis because clearly the dollar has been strengthening for quite a while particularly against certain currencies like the Yen or the Canadian dollar a lot of the emerging market currencies. So it's again impact and that's the reason why we wanted to call it out.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span>Katy Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><span>Will you do any price harmonization if the dollar remained strong?</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span>Luca Maestri</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><span>No, we price our products in a way that is in general reflective of pricing here in the United States and it's a pricing that we want to keep in place for reasonable periods of time. We do not like to make sudden changes to our pricing.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span>Katy Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><span>Okay, then as a follow up, I wonder if you can comment on the how NAND capacity and SKU mix is tracking versus your expectations for iPhone 6?</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span>Tim Cook</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><span>Yeah Katy, it's Tim. At this point, we're selling everything we made. And so it's difficult to say that we've been -- that we've absolutely made it well on the SKU mix and the split between the iPhone 6 and the 6 Plus.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><span>From everything we can tell, we've done a pretty good job on that. But I'll stop short of saying there is no issue at all, because it's hard to tell when you are at a point where you are selling everything you are making. It is a good problem to have.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span>Katy Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><span>Got it, congrats on the quarter.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span>Tim Cook</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><span>Thank you, very much, thank you.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span>Nancy Paxton</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><span>Thanks Katy. Can we have the next question please?</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span>Operator</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><span>From Sanford Bernstein we'll hear from Toni Sacconaghi. And Toni you may want to check your mute button.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span>Toni Sacconaghi \u2013 Sanford Bernstein</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><span>Yes, sorry about that. I have one for Luca and one for Tim please. Luca the question for you is a bit of a follow up from the last one which is that we saw a pretty robust sequential increase in ASPs this quarter in the iPhone and I was wondering if you could qualitatively help us understand whether that was a higher mix of new phones than you typically see in the September quarter or was it really a function of the new phones having a richer ASP?</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><span>And if we look forward to calendar fiscal Q1, last year you had a very substantial ASP increase, should we be thinking about a similar kind of ASP increase this quarter given I think a widespread belief that availability on the 6 Plus has been even more constrained and that we could see a much higher percentage of 6 Plus as a percentage of total iPhones shipped in the quarter and next quarter?</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span>Luca Maestri</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><span>Yes Toni. So, on a sequential basis our ASPs for iPhone were up $42. And as you said correctly the reason for the increase was a higher mix of the new iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><span>There was a partial offset in the quarter from the transition cost that we incurred typically when we moved to a new product.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><span>Going forward obviously, the percentage of new iPhone 6 and 6 Plus will increase sequentially as we are going to have the full quarter available to us and it's correct that iPhone 6 Plus is supply constrained right now.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span>Toni Sacconaghi \u2013 Sanford Bernstein</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><span>Okay and then Tim for you, I was wondering again qualitatively if you could help us understand what you think the mix of repeat buyers is for iPhone 6 let's say over the next year versus first time iPhone customers.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><span>And you know the question in that is, do you believe that because the iPhone 6 is so compelling that that traditional replacement cycle might be accelerated over the next several quarters? And if that\u2019s ultimately the case, do you in the future run reversion back towards in the elongating of that replacement cycle in future generations?</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span>Tim Cook</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><span>It is difficult to answer exactly, but let me sort of back up and give you some data, maybe that will help frame the topic. So if you look at some of our top countries and how they did in the mid year of selling a customer the first iPhone they had ever bought.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><span>What you would see is that in countries like China over 80% of the people that we were selling the 4s2 were buying the first iPhone ever in the U.S. it was over 60%.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><span>And so those kind of give you some goalpost of large countries in terms of first time ownership at our entry level. As you step across and look at the 5s, which was at that time the top end phone, in China still almost half the people were buying their first iPhone ever buying try this and about a quarter of the U.S. population buying a 5s or buying their first one.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><span>So that kind of gives you some goalpost and so, the way I look at those numbers are, that on a forward basis what would I expect, obviously we don\u2019t give guidance on this kind of stuff is that I still see a fairly large opportunity in people buying their first iPhone ever and I think with these products that we just announced with 6 and 6 Plus that opportunity increases not decreases.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><span>I also believe that the upgrade market for people that were waiting for 6, for iPhone 6 or 6 Plus, as we can see from our order backlog that number is huge. And so I would expect that to go on for some period of time because you have people that time out of contract at different time, no everybody does that at launch time.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><span>And so I see both the first time buyer being a great opportunity and the up-grader. Some of the first time buyers are people that have never owned a smartphone before and some of them are switchers from android.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><span>And so, right now, everything, all of those look very good to us, but we're in the early going and we're selling everything we're making and so it's going to take some period of time before we have a better handle on what those numbers will look like in steady state. But I've never felt so great after a launch before, maybe that's the best way to summarized it all.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span>Toni Sacconaghi \u2013 Sanford Bernstein</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><span>Thank you.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span>Nancy Paxton</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><span>Thanks Toni. Can we have the next question please?</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span>Operator</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><span>From UBS we'll hear from Steven Milunovich.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span>Steven Milunovich - UBS</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><span>Thanks. Is there more color you can give us on the mix of 6 and 6 Plus, particularly to the degree you see it in the order book? Our book suggests it's maybe 2.5 to 1, 6 to 6 Plus in the U.S., but and maybe that geographically it's quite different. Asia may be going for the bigger screen is there any color you can give us?</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span>Tim Cook</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><span>Steve, there's not a lot of color that I can give that I feel is terribly accurate because as I said before, we're selling everything we're making and so essentially what our current sell through looks like is our current supply.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><span>And so in the long arc of time, once there is enough supply to meet demand that mix might look differently. Digits clear or at least I think that we will see a difference by geography in terms of preference and we thought that going into the launch of -- and there's no data that we perceived to date that would suggest that, that's not the case and so that's all about all I can say at this point.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span>Steven Milunovich - UBS</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><span>Okay. And then regarding the strength in Mac and the weakness in iPad I guess, what's the message from the market that you take away from that and does that perhaps at all affect your view of doing a convertible type product which in the past has not kind of an Apple's approach, you tend to like to do very focused products there might be that there is something in between that could be quite successful?</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span>Tim Cook</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><span>Let me comment on both the Mac and the iPad. On the Mac it was just absolutely blow-away order. Our best ever, it will result in our highest market share since 1995. It's just absolutely stunning.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><span>Get back-to-school season voted and the Mac 1 and carried the day and we're really proud of that. I'm proud of the Mac team. It's clear that the -- all the work that we've put into our Notebooks, on the hardware and the software side is resonating with our customers and I think if you went out to college campuses about now, you will see a lot of Mac and there are lot of new Mac Notebooks there based on the sales.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><span>And so that feels fantastic being up 21% in that market that's shrinking it just -- it doesn\u2019t get better than that.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><span>For iPad, if I take a step back on iPad, and I know that there is a lot of negative commentary in the market on this, but I have a little different perspective on it. Here's sort of my simple perspective.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><span>If you look at, instead of looking at this thing each 90 days, if you back up and look at it, we've sold 237 million in just over four years. That's about twice the number of iPhones that we sold over the first four years of iPhone.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><span>If you look at the last 12 months of iPad, we sold 68 million in '13, in fiscal year '13 we sold 71 million. So we were down, but we were down 4% on sell in and the sell-through was a bit better than the negative 4 because we took down channel inventories. And so, to me I view it as a speed bob, not a huge issue.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><span>That's said, we want to grow. We don\u2019t like negative numbers on these things and so, looking further in the data, I know that there is a popular view that the market is saturated, but we don\u2019t see that. I can't speak to other people but I do look at our data deeply.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><span>And in the last market research data we have is in the June quarter, and let me give you some of this -- the real data that we've got. is that if you look at our top six revenue countries, in the country that\u2019s sold the lowest percentage of iPads to people who had never bought an iPad before that number is 50%.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><span>And the range goes from 50 to over 70. And so when I look at number, our first time buyer rates in that area, it is saturated, that's not a saturated market. You never have first time buyer rates at 50% and 70%. What you do see is that people hold on to iPad longer than they do a phone.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><span>And because we've only been in this business four years, we don\u2019t really know what the upgrade cycle will be for people. And so that's a difficult thing to call.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><span>What we do know is that people always respond for us doing great products and we feel really great about what we introduced last week. We also know that the deeper the Apps go in the enterprise, the more it opens up avenues in enterprise and that's a key part of the IBM partnership and what I think customers will get out of that, which is more important than our selling is changing the right people who work.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><span>And so I see catalyst going forward. There are obvious cannibalization; things that are occurring. I'm sure that some people looked at the Mac and iPad and decided on a Mac. I don\u2019t have research to demonstrate that, but I am sure that will be just looking at the numbers and I am fine with that by the way.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><span>I am sure that some people will look at an iPad and an iPhone and decide just to get an iPhone and I'm fine with that as well. But over the long arc of time, my own judgment is that iPad has a great future, healthy individual 90-day clicks workout, I don\u2019t know, But I'm very bullish on where we can take iPad over time and so we're continuing to invest in the product pipeline.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><span>We're continuing to invest in distribution. If you look at how we did in emerging markets like BRIC countries as an example, we were up 20% for the full year of '14. And so these numbers are impressive and obviously the BRIC countries are growing as a percentage of our total as is developing markets.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><span>And so, it looks a bit different geography to geography, and so that\u2019s a long answer to your question, but I thought it was important for you to at least share my perspective and you can judge it as you will.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span>Steven Milunovich - UBS</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><span>Thanks.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span>Nancy Paxton</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><span>Thanks Steve. Can we have the next question please?</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span>Operator</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><span>And we'll hear from Ben Reitzes from Barclays.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span>Ben Reitzes - Barclays</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><span>Hey, thanks a lot. Tim, I was wondering what we were to make out of your new segments with the Apple Watch being in the other category. We were just a little surprised to hear that because it seems like such a substantial new category and you could sell may be even tens of millions of unit.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><span>So by putting it lumped in the other with iPods and a lot of other things, does that say something about your expectations for that product or do you think that you'll just break it out after a little while?</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span>Tim Cook</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><span>Probably it says nothing about our expectation for the product. We didn't form those categories based on expectations. We looked at current revenue, today revenue, and decided that we would love everything that wasn\u2019t a Mac, an iPad, or an iPhone or a service in one kind of category.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><span>In the future, we might decide something different, but for now, in Q1 we're not shipping any iPhone or excuse me, Apple Watches and so it seems appropriate to start it that way.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><span>And also to be also straight is I am not very anxious in reporting a lot of numbers on Apple Watch because of the -- and giving a lot of detail on it because our competitors are looking for it and so aggregating it is helpful from that point of view as well.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span>Ben Reitzes - Barclays</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><span>Okay. Got it. And then with regard to my next question is you put out a lot of products and we obviously everybody gives you a lot of credit for the great new product lineup that we have, but everybody talks about what's next.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><span>You said in an interview recently on TV that you were working on products that people didn't even speculate on yet and that's pretty hard with Apple considering how many people watch your company and write about it.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><span>So I was just wondering if you could elaborate on that may be in terms of your excitement around new products and what did you mean by that comment and how do you feel about the future in light of that comment you made? Thanks a lot.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span>Tim Cook</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><span>I am incredibly optimistic about the future. We've already announced two new categories in the last 60 days or so or less than 60 days with Apple Pay and Apple Watch. So shipping the watch early next year and obviously we're working on other things as well and to the degree that I can keep that in the cone of silence, I am going to do it and so I am not sure what to say.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><span>I am not going to give any answer or anything. We look at a lot of different things and we're fortunate to have a lot of creative people here that want to change the world and have a lot of great ideas.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span>Ben Reitzes - Barclays</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><span>All right. Thanks Tim.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span>Nancy Paxton</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><span>Thanks. And could we have the next question please?</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span>Operator</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><span>We'll go to Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span>Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><span>Hey, good afternoon. A follow-up to Ben's question in terms of the last year you had higher expectations in terms of new product categories and the iPhone 6 launch but there are some investors who think about Apple and a products type of story.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><span>So Tim, I'd be interested in how you think about the story broadly in 2015 and kind of exciting things to be focused on as an investor and then I have a follow-up to Luca.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span>Tim Cook</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><span>Well for Apple if as an investor I would hope that people would look at what we've done and what we've delivered and the power and strength of the product line that we've announced and maybe more importantly then all the stuff that you see, is to look at the skills within this company.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><span>And the fact that I think it's the only company on the planet that has the ability to integrate hardware and software and services at a world-class level and that in itself allows Apple to play in so many different areas and so the challenge becomes one of deciding which ones to say no to and which ones to say yes to and want to focus not once -- not once do we have any great ideas and we always had more ideas than we have resources to deal with.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><span>And so I would look at that. I would look at what we talked about last week. Things like continuity and if you use your imagination and think about where that goes, there is no other company that can do this. Apple is the only one and I think this becomes so incredibly important moving forward for customers living in an environment where they're using multiple devices.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><span>And so I would look at the skills, the capabilities, the passion of the company and the creative engine has never been stronger. And I think you can see that from the Apple Watch, you can see that with Apple Pay. Apple Pay is a classic app for taking something that is incredibly old, outdated, kludgy.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><span>Everybody is focused on everything except for the customer and putting the customer at the center of the experience and making something very elegant. And so I would look at those things and when I look at those things, I would as an investor, I feel great, as a personal investor I feel great.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span>Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><span>No. That's helpful. And a follow-up for Luca, you mentioned that you have typical transition costs that involve in new products you're rolling out. Do those costs start to ease in the March quarter and would that presumably have a positive impact on gross margins in March versus December. Thanks.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span>Luca Maestri</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><span>Yes, and you know pretty much what our product cadence is and what it's been in the past and you know that the holiday season is a period where we have significant product events and we're not providing any guidance for the March quarter.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><span>And also keep in mind Gene if you're trying to extrapolate gross margins into the future, there are so many factors that affect gross margin over time and it's not only transition cost, but its product mix, its foreign exchange, its commodity markets.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span>Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><span>Okay. Great. Thanks. Congratulations.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span>Luca Maestri</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><span>Thank you.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span>Nancy Paxton</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><span>Thanks Gene. Could we have the next question please?</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span>Operator</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><span>And from Bank of Montreal, we'll go to Keith Buckman.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span>Keith Buckman - Bank of Montreal</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><span>Hi, Tim, I was wondering if you could characterize China a little bit. The numbers I understand weren't as good as the rest of the company this quarter but presumably that was all the delay of the iPhone.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><span>So I'm really asking if you talk about the last few weeks and more importantly as you look at December quarter in particular related to some of the political backdrop including the carriers have been mandated not to spend the same level of subsidies.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><span>Do you see any of that impacting your opportunities for Apple broadly speaking but more specifically for iPhones as it relates to subsidy levels?</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span>Tim Cook</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><span>That's a good question. If you -- if you just -- if you look at Greater China Q4 of '14 compared to Q4 of '13, the obvious difference is that we launched the 5s in Q4 of '13 and in this year, we didn't have a new product launch. We were launching in this quarter in Q1 of '15.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><span>The second thing that's not as apparent probably, but is more related to that is that last year we increased our channel inventory by $1.3 million. This year, we actually decreased it slightly. And so you have a compounded effect of their launch and a huge change in channel inventory on a year-over-year basis.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><span>So the way that I assess the strength of the market is I look at unit sell-through and to share with you what it was in Greater China, iPhone unit sell through despite no launch in Q4 was up 32% year-over-year.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><span>The market was projected by IDC to only grow 13%. So we feel incredibly great about that. Macs were up 54% year-over-year and that's against the IDC's estimate of the market contraction in China of 7% and so those are two stalwarts that were really driving results and so the underlying results look totally different than the reported results because of the channel inventory kind of differences.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><span>The App Store in China is also doing great. The growth there is phenomenal. iPad concreted some during the quarter, but for the full year we did grow -- we were up 9% year-over-year for the full year and so I see lots of positives.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><span>As you know China is on the early stages of their huge 4G rollout.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span>Keith Buckman - Bank of Montreal</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><span>Yes.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span>Tim Cook</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><span>And this weekend -- this past weekend we launched it with China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom. This was the first time we've launched a new iPhone with all three carriers and we've done it at the early stages of the 4G rollout and so I am incredibly bullish over it.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><span>In terms of subsidies there are regulatory pressures on subsidies. We have -- we've seen that. However, only 20% of the iPhones that we've been selling in China have had a traditional subsidy applied to it and so the vast majority don't.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><span>And so will it make a difference with that 20%, I don't know yet. Intuitively you were thinking, it would, but it's at least a percentage of a 20% instead of a percentage of 100%.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><span>And so when I look at China, I see an enormous market where there are more people graduating into the middle class than any nation on earth in history and just an incredible market where people brought the latest technology and products that we were providing.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><span>And so we're investing like crazy in the market. We're more than doubling our stores. We've got 15 in Greater China today. We're going to be close to 40 in the next couple of years. We've expanded our online store to cover now 315 cities in China. The revenue results for Q4 were up more than double the previous year.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><span>The App Store is growing. Chinese developers have now created a 150,000 apps -- of the apps on the App Store and so I see lots of very, very positive factors there and I couldn\u2019t be more excited.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span>Keith Buckman - Bank of Montreal</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><span>Okay. And then as my follow-up if I could, Tim, you mentioned before on a previous comment on iPad where you saw I think 50% to 70% in the top six countries were new buyers and related to a previous question, wondered if you could give that same range. I understand it's probably a pretty wide range for iPhones and that was to the June quarter I think.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><span>And broadly speaking, how does that number change at least your guess as you look out over the next couple quarters given the launch of the 6 and the 6 Plus.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span>Tim Cook</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><span>For iPhone I really have it by model from the June quarter and as I had mentioned before, the highest percentage is the 4s buyer in China over 80% of the people were buying their first iPhone.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><span>And for a 5s in China, 50% were and so I think what that says. Those numbers are so high, the 80 that I think are great -- my gut tells me, a great percentage of 6 and 6 Plus buyers will eventually -- a great percentage of those will be new to iPhone. That's what I would predict.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span>Keith Buckman - Bank of Montreal</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><span>Okay. That's it for me guys. Thank you.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span>Tim Cook</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><span>Thank you, Keith.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span>Nancy Paxton</span></strong><span></span></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><span>Thank Keith. A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks as a podcast on the iTunes Store, as a webcast on apple.com/investor and via telephone and the numbers for the telephone replay are 888-203-1112 or 719-457-0820 and please enter a confirmation code 1997837.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><span>And these replays will be available by approximately 5.00 PM Pacific Time today.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead ma\u2019am.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple's CEO, Tim Cook; and he will be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri, and after that we\u2019ll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you\u2019ll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margins, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes and future products.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple\u2019s Form 10-K for 2014 and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates. And I\u2019d also just like to remind you that as we indicated in our last quarterly call, we\u2019re now including the results of our retail stores in the geographic segments where the stores are located and retail is no longer classified as an operating segment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We\u2019ve also updated our product summary reporting and we\u2019re now reflecting five categories of results; iPhone, iPad, Mac, Services and Other Products. We\u2019ve prepared schedules showing reclassifications of historical operating segment and product results for each of the last 12 quarters to conform to these new groupings and they are available now on our Web site at apple.com/investor.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">So I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us. Today we\u2019re reporting on a historic quarter and I'm incredibly proud of everyone who contributed to the amazing results you\u2019re about to hear. Interest in Apple products is at an all time high, with over 0.5 billion customer visits to our physical and online stores during the quarter. Demand for iPhone has been staggering, shattering our high expectations with sales of over 74 million units, driven by the unprecedented popularity of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. This volume is hard to comprehend. On average we sold over 34,000 iPhones every hour, 24 hours a day, everyday of the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">The execution by all of our teams to achieve these results was spectacular. By the end of the quarter, our new iPhones were available in 130 countries around the world, making this our fastest and most successful roll out ever. Additionally, the App Store and the Mac each set new records for quarterly revenues. Mac units were up 14% to 5.5 million, while the rest of the PC market continued to decline. App Store revenues was up a remarkable 41%. Demand was strong around the world. Flurry estimated that Apple products accounted for over half of all mobile device activations globally from December 19th to December 25th.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">It was truly a momentous quarter for iOS. On November 22nd we shipped our 1 billionth iOS device. It was a Space Gray 64 gigabyte iPhone 6 Plus, which we\u2019ve saved here at Apple. 1 billion devices is an almost unfathomable milestone, and we are all incredibly proud to be a part of it. Apple\u2019s mission is to make the greatest products on earth and enrich the lives of others. Through the success of iOS we have provided hundreds and millions of people with powerful personal technology that is simple and fun to use. Our customers are using Apple products to transform education, discover new ideas for business and express their creativity in ways that no one could have imagined when we sold the first iPhone less than eight years ago. It\u2019s amazing to watch and it reminds that people and great ideas are the reasons we make the things we make.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Our strong overall performance in the December quarter resulted in total company revenue of $74.6 billion, and earnings of $18 billion. Both of these numbers are all-time records for us, with revenues up 30% and earnings up 38% over last year. And due to our very large capital return activities, earnings per share were up even more at 48% to $3.06, also an all-time quarterly record. Our results would have been even stronger, absent fierce foreign exchange volatility.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We\u2019ve also made great progress on a number of very exciting new initiatives to further strengthen our ecosystem. We\u2019ve been blown away by the reaction to Swift, our new programing language. Inventing a new programing language is something very few companies can do, and we believe it will have a profound effect on our ecosystem. Swift became available in September as part of the Xcode tools and in the first month those tools were downloaded over 11 million times. A recent report from Redmonk showed that Swift has had unprecedented growth and is quickly climbing the list of the most popular programing languages.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We\u2019ve seen many of our developers choosing Swift as they build significant new projects, and we are seeing fantastic work with Swift going on in education. Very recently, Stanford University released their Developing iOS 8 Apps with Swift course, which was posted to iTunes University making this amazing resource available to everyone in the world.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">There has also been incredible interest in HealthKit with over 600 developers now integrating it into their apps. Consumers can now choose to securely share their health and wellness metrics with these apps and this has led to some great, new and innovative experiences in fitness and wellness, food and nutrition and healthcare.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">For example, with apps such as an American Well, users can securely share data such as blood pressure, weight or activity directly with physicians, and leading hospitals such as Duke Medicine, Stanford Children and Penn Medicine are integrating data from HealthKit into their electronic medical record so that physicians can reach out to patients proactively when they see a problem that needs attention.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">With HealthKit and the iOS health app, we believe we\u2019re just at the beginning of amazing new health and wellness solutions for our customers. Our extensions of iOS in the home with HomeKit and in the car with CarPlay also continue to progress and this year we are looking forward to amazing HomeKit enabled products from several companies, and CarPlay enabled vehicles from over 30 automotive brands.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Also as you know, we introduced two new categories in the fall and we\u2019re making great progress on both of them. Apple Pay is off to a very strong start and the feedback that we are getting from both individuals and institutions is extremely positive. Today about 750 banks and credit unions have signed on to bring Apple Pay to their customers, and in just three months after launch, Apple Pay makes up more than $2 out of $3 spent on purchases using contactless payment across the three major U.S. card networks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In merchants who already accept Apple Pay, the rates are even higher. Panera Bread tells us Apple Pay represents nearly 80% of their mobile payment transactions, and since the launch of Apple Pay, Whole Foods Market had seen mobile payments increased by more than 400%. You can use Apple Pay up and down Mainstreet, to pick up a prescription at Walgreens at Duane Reade, get office or school supplies at Office Depot and Staples and shop for groceries at national and regional stores from coast-to-coast, including BI-LO, Harvey\u2019s, Save Mart, Wegmans Food Markets, Whole Foods and Winn-Dixie among others.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">More merchants are excited to bring Apple Pay to their customers and adoption is strong. Just today USA Technologies announced they made Apple Pay available at about 200,000 places where everyday payments happen, including vending machines and businesses, airports and schools, commercial laundry machines and colleges, universities and laundromats and parking meters and payment kiosks in lots across the country. Point-of-sale suppliers tell us they are seeing unprecedented demand from merchants, and all of our partners and customers simply love this new service. With all of this momentum in the early days, we are more convinced than ever that 2015 will be the year of Apple Pay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Development for Apple Watch is right on schedule and we expect to begin shipping in April. Developers are hard at work on apps, notifications and information summaries that we call Glances, all designed specifically for the Watch's user interface. The creativity and software innovation going on around Apple Watch is incredibly exciting and we can\u2019t wait for our customers to experience them when Apple Watch becomes available.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We\u2019re also making great progress in our partnership with IBM and our collaboration is winning over new customers. In December, we delivered the first 10 MobileFirst for iOS apps for banking, retail, insurance, financial services, telecommunications, governments and airlines, making iPhone and iPad even more productive for enterprises by providing [Apple] [ph] Cloud services with IBM's Big Data and analytics capabilities. Another 12 apps will be released this quarter, including three new industries, healthcare, energy and utilities, and industrial products. This will bring us to a total of 22 apps and we\u2019re on track to have over 100 by the end of 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In just over a month, more than a dozen enterprise customers have signed on as foundation clients to transform their companies with iPhone, iPad and IBM MobileFirst solutions including Miami Dade County, the seventh largest county in the United States by population, and American Eagle Outfitters, which operates more than 1,000 retail stores and ships to over 80 countries worldwide. And the list of new customers is expanding rapidly. IBM is engaged with more than 130 additional companies looking to empower their employees with MobileFirst for iOS solutions and the list keeps growing. We couldn\u2019t be more pleased with this partnership.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In addition to all these initiatives, we have a robust product and services pipeline that we are very excited about, and we look forward to sharing more about them with you throughout the year. In addition to the contributions we make to humanity through our products, we made great progress on imported projects during the quarter including ConnectED and (PRODUCT)RED. With ConnectED we\u2019re focused on making a difference for students in communities who need it the most. We recently chose 114 schools across 29 states to receive an Apple ConnectED grant. Despite their economic challenges, all of these schools share a vision of what their students' lives would be like with Apple technology and we\u2019re proud to help them bring that to life.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">And in December, we undertook our largest ever initiative to help (PRODUCT)RED achieve the goal of an AIDS free generation. To commemorate World AIDS Day, we worked with some of our developer partners to create and donate the proceeds from 25 special apps and we also contributed a portion of sales at our retail and online stores on two of the year\u2019s busiest shopping days. As a result, Apple\u2019s donation set a new record.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Delivering the results we\u2019re reporting today reflects months and years of focus and determination from teams across Apple as well as our amazing developers and business partners. I\u2019d like to thank all of them for their commitment and performance and I\u2019d also like to thank our incredible customers for their ongoing loyalty and enthusiasm.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Luca to discuss our December quarter results in more detail.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"><strong>Luca Maestri</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Thank you, Tim and good afternoon everyone. In the December quarter we generated all time record revenue of $74.6 billion, an increase of $17 billion, or 30% year-over-year. We achieved this exceptional performance despite significant foreign exchange headwinds from many currencies.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Our growth was broad based across the world, with revenue from developed countries up 20% and revenue from emerging countries up 58%. The performance of our Greater China segment was particularly impressive, with revenue up 70%. Sales were well ahead of our expectations in a number of areas. The unprecedented demand for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus combined with our tremendously successful production ramp allowed us to build and ship several million more iPhones than we had expected when we provided guidance back in October. And also Mac revenue and services revenue reached all-time highs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Gross margin was 39.9% above our guidance range and operating margin was $24.2 billion, representing 32.5% of revenue, and our highest operating margin percentage in 10 quarters. Net income was $18 billion, surpassing our previous all-time record by almost $5 billion. This translated to diluted earnings per share of $3.06, a 48% year-over-year increase. Cash flow from operations was exceptional at $33.7 billion, also a new all-time record.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">For details by product I will start with iPhone. We sold 74.5 million iPhones, an increase of 23.4 million over last year, representing 46% growth. iPhone sales grew strongly in both developed and emerging markets. Among many great results around the world, unit sales were up 44% in the U.S. and up 97% in the BRIC countries.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Sales doubled year-over-year in China, our second largest iPhone market, as well as in Brazil and in Singapore. Thanks to the popularity of iPhone 6 Plus, and the increased value customers saw in our higher storage capacity offerings, iPhone ASPs were $687, an increase of $50 over the year ago quarter. This led to iPhone revenue growth of 57% year-over-year, with quarterly sales exceeding $50 billion for the first time ever.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We had a 200,000 unit decline in iPhone channel inventory during December quarter this year, compared to an increase of about 1 million iPhones during the year ago period, and we were not able to reach supply demand balance until this month. This left us below our target range of five to seven weeks of channel inventory on a look forward basis. We\u2019re now working with about 375 carriers, representing 72% of the world\u2019s mobile phone subscriber base, and we have over 210,000 points of sale for iPhone across the globe.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Our customers love their iPhones. A December ChangeWave survey measured a 97% customer satisfaction rating for iPhone. A study published by Chitika Insights last month indicated that iPhone accounts for 53% of North America smartphone web traffic, almost twice the level of the next closest brand. And in the corporate market ChangeWave found that among IT buyers planning to purchase smartphones in the March quarter this year, 77% intend to purchase iPhones.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Next I\u2019d like to talk about the Mac. We sold 5.5 million Macs, an increase of almost 700,000 units over last year, a 14% growth rate. Thanks for the popularity of our stunning new iMac with Retina 5K display, Mac ASPs increased by $58 sequentially, driving all time record revenue for Mac of 6.9 billion. We achieved double-digit year-over-year unit growth in both desktops and portables. These results are truly remarkable, given the contraction in the global PC market which IDC estimates declined by 3% in the quarter. We have now gained market share for 34 of the last 35 quarters. We ended the quarter with Mac channel inventory slightly below our four to five week target range.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to iPad, we sold 21.4 million units compared to 26 million in the December quarter last year. Given the introduction of new iPads in October, we increased iPad channel inventory by 1.1 million units during the quarter, compared to an increase of about 2.1 million in the December quarter last year. This left us within our five to seven week target range of channel inventory on a look forward basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Customer experience and usage data for iPad continue to be excellent. In our November survey, ChangeWave measured a 98% customer satisfaction rate for iPad Air, and also found that among people to finding a purchase a tabled within 90 days, 60% plan to purchase an iPad. And among businesses planning to purchase tablets, the intent was even stronger at 78%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Chitika Insights' most recent report indicated that iPad users in North America generate over 70% of tablet based web traffic, more than six times the web traffic of the next closest competitor and Custora\u2019s latest e-commerce report indicates that iPad accounts for 82% of all U.S. e-commerce transactions from tablets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">All these results are consistent with usage data from the holiday shopping season. IBM\u2019s digital analytics benchmark service found that iOS devices accounted for more than twice the online traffic and almost four times the e-commerce sales on Android devices during November and December. The Apple ecosystem continues to thrive. Combining all of our services, revenue grew to 4.8 billion in the December quarter, a new all-time high and an increase of 9% year-over-year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">This record performance was driven primarily by the tremendous momentum of the App Store, with revenue growing 41% in the December quarter. Our iOS developers have earned over $25 billion from the App Store to date, and we\u2019re thrilled with their success. Total sales of media and software from iTunes were $2.6 billion, compared to $2.4 billion in the year ago quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Our direct China performance was also outstanding. We welcomed more visitors than ever before and generated record revenue in both our physical and online stores. We opened 10 new retail stores during the quarter, bringing us to a total of 447, 182 of which are outside the United States. We\u2019ve opened two new stores this month in Greater China and we\u2019re on track towards 40 stores in Greater China by mid-2016.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $178 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $22.7 billion. We completed our first international debt offering, issuing 2.8 billion euro denominated notes at very attractive interest rates and greatly diversifying our debt investor base. We spent 5 billion to repurchase 45 million Apple shares through open market transactions, paid 2.8 billion in dividends and equivalents, and utilized over 500 million to net share settle vesting employee RSUs. We also retired an additional 8 million shares in connection with our accelerated share repurchase programs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We have now taken action on almost $103 billion of our $130 billion capital return program, including $73 billion in share repurchases, with four quarters remaining to its completion. In the last 12 months alone, we have returned over $57 billion to our investors. We review our capital return program on an ongoing basis. We continue to solicit feedback from a broad base of investors and we're on track to announce an update to the program in April when we report our second quarter results.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Now as we move ahead into the March quarter, I\u2019d like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $52 billion and $55 billion, compared to $45.6 billion in the year ago quarter, and this represents a very significant revenue increase, despite growing foreign exchange headwinds from the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most currencies.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We expect gross margin to be between 38.5% and 39.5%, we expect OpEx to be between $5.4 billion and $5.5 billion and we expect OI&amp;E to be about $350 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 26.3%. Also today our Board has declared dividend of $0.47 per common share payable on February 12, 2015 to shareholders of record as of February 9, 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">With that let's open the call to questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">And we ask that you limit yourself to one part question and one follow-up. Operator may we have the first question please. </p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p5\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">[Operator Instructions] First we\u2019ll hear from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Shannon Cross </span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Thank you very much and nice iPhone numbers. Can you talk about Luca about currency? How you are thinking about it? What it did this quarter? What it does to gross margin? And what\u2019s it\u2019s going to do during the year? Because that\u2019s clearly a big topic of conversation?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Luca Maestri</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Yes, Shannon I\u2019ll do that now. I\u2019ll talk about Q1. I\u2019ll talk about what we are looking for Q2 and possibly even further. Obviously, what we\u2019ve seen during Q1 has been unprecedented movements in currencies. I would say during the course of the quarter the biggest impact came from the Japanese yen, the Russian rubel, but also from euro, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar. Our revenue growth during Q1 would have been four percentage points higher on a constant currency basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On a profitability standpoint, our hedging program partially mitigated the impact from the volatility in currencies. As we look forward, and we look into particularly the March quarter, the foreign exchange headwinds will be stronger in Q2 than they were in Q1 for two main reasons. The first one is the fact that the U.S. dollar has continued to appreciate against foreign currencies during the last few weeks. And the other one is the fact that our existing hedges expire. They get replace by new contracts at current levels and therefore the protection that is provided to us by our hedging program diminishes over time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">What that means to us going forward for the March quarter is that revenue growth on a year-over-year basis in constant currency would be five point higher than what we are guiding to, if it wasn\u2019t for the FX movements. In terms of gross margins, and you know that we look our gross margins on a sequential basis, the gross margin percentage after the offset that we're getting from the hedging program will be impacted by over 100 basis points.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Now having said that, we have factored the impact that I just described into the guidance that we provided to you. So that\u2019s where we are right now. Of course, as you look further out, you know we do not provide guidance past the March quarter, but it goes without saying that at current levels, again those headwinds will continue to become stronger for the reason I explained earlier, that our hedges continue to expire, they get replaced by new hedging contracts at current levels and so -- and there is the impact that we would see during the course of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">It goes without saying strong U.S. dollar has negative impact on our international business. Having said all that, we have provided what we believe is very strong guidance for the March quarter. We remain very, very confident about the portfolio of products and services that we have in the market today and we remain very, very confident in the pipeline of products and services that we have.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Shannon Cross </span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">And as a follow-up to that, can you talk a little bit about pricing power? Basically as you think about currency and euro movements and that -- and then the contracts you have with the carriers, can you talk about maybe the opportunities to raise prices, because I know it's something that a lot of companies are balancing right now?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Luca Maestri</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">I think as you know, we prefer to adjust local pricing at the time of new product launches. That will be obviously our preference. That\u2019s what we do in normal times. When currencies move as much as they have been in places like Russia for example, sometimes we need to take mid-cycle action to realign pricing. So we\u2019ll see what happens. As you know currency markets tend to be very volatile. So we just want to understand a bit better what is happening.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">From UBS we\u2019ll hear from Steve Milunovich.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steve Milunovich</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">I wonder if you could address the mix of the iPhone 6 line. Specifically, how did the 6 Plus do? I don\u2019t know if you can give us a sense relative to total units, maybe geographic view, and also availability? Are you calling up on the 6 Plus?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Cook</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Steve, its Tim. We don\u2019t report out the precise mix. But what I can tell you is that iPhone 6 was the most popular iPhone last quarter, but I just believe to sell 74.5 million they were really all popular. And all did well. There is clearly a geographic difference where some geos would skew much higher on their preference to iPhone 6 Plus than other geos. And so it\u2019s something that is not consistent around the world. But both did incredibly well, and we\u2019re really proud of them, along with the iPhone 5S and 5C as well, which continues to in the lineup.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steve Milunovich</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. And then could you update us in terms of the sell through relative to the reported numbers for the Phone, the Pad and your biggest plans to increase by roughly a week of channel inventory?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Cook</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">From an iPhone point of view, as I think Luca covered, our channel inventory decreased from the beginning of the quarter by 200,000 units, and that left us outside of our target range on the low -- outside the low end of the range to be specific. Just recently we became in supply demand balance on the 6 and 6 Plus in January. We were not able to reach a balanced state during our fiscal Q1.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">On iPad, we increased channel inventory by 1.1 million units from beginning of the quarter to end of the quarter. That compares to the previous year where we're increased to 2.1 million. Obviously, that inventory was required because of all the new products that we announced on iPad with the iPad Air 2 and the iPad Mini 3 in the October timeframe during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">At the end of the quarter, we were within the target range of channel inventory on iPad. In terms of growing channel inventory, in particular on iPhone where we\u2019re outside of it, we wouldn\u2019t expect to see a large step function increase. We would expect it to occur more gradually over time than sort of all at once type of thing. But we don\u2019t guide to channel inventory specifically as you know.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Nancy Paxton</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Thank you, Steve. Can we have the next question please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">From Morgan Stanley we\u2019ll go to Katy Huberty.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Katy Huberty</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So not to dilute the fantastic performance in December, but can you talk a little bit about how you think about the sustainability of this very strong iPhone demand into 2015, particularly given that most carriers had access to that product during the quarter? And then I have a follow up on margin?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Cook</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Sure Katy. It\u2019s Tim. You can see from the March guidance that we\u2019ve given, that we are incredibly bullish about iPhone going forward. We believe that it\u2019s the best smartphone in the world. Our customers are telling us that. The market is telling us that. We\u2019re doing well in virtually every corner of the world. And so we\u2019re very bullish that it does have legs. I would point out that only a small fraction of the installed base has upgraded. And so there is a lot more people within the installed base. But I would also point out that we had the highest number of customers new to iPhone last quarter than in any prior launch. And also that the current iPhone line up experienced the highest Android switcher rate in any of the last three launches in the three previous years. And we didn\u2019t look back to the other years. So I don\u2019t know about those.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And so we see that we\u2019re appealing to new customers, both new to smartphone and new to iPhone and people switching. We\u2019re very bullish on the product and getting great feedback about the quality of the products we\u2019re shipping. And so we\u2019re very, very bullish. The emerging markets which has been a source to great questions over time, the growth was absolutely stunning, in Brazil and Mainland China more than doubling year-over-year which is 3x to 4x what those markets were doing according to IDC. And so we enter the quarter with quite a bit of momentum.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Katy Huberty</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And Luca as you know, you typically enjoy component cost downs and yield improvements as you move through a product cycle. Is there anything other than currency that keeps you from potentially locking the gross margins higher over the course of the year? Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Luca Maestri</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Katy, you\u2019re right. I mean on both fronts. We certainly expect more favorable cost in the March quarter than we\u2019ve seen in the December quarter. It goes with our product cycle. The foreign exchange headwinds as I was explaining to Shannon, they will be on a sequential basis a headwind of more than 100 basis points. So if you were to exclude that foreign exchange impact, we would actually be guiding to sequential increase in margins.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">The other element that is there and it\u2019s very seasonal, it\u2019s always there, it\u2019s the loss of leverage that we got from Q1 to Q2. When you look at our revenue guidance, we are guiding to a sequential decline between 26% and 30%. So you obviously have that loss of leverage, but without a doubt the biggest headwind that we got right now is foreign exchange. Having said all that guiding 38.5% to 39.5%, we feel slightly very good about where we are right now in the cycle.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Katie could we have the next question please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">We\u2019ll go to Benjamin Reitzes, Barclays.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Benjamin Reitzes</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And Tim obviously a lot of good questions about the great iPhone number but I wanted to ask about the Apple Watch. Shifting in April, month or two later than I think you said originally obviously, probably not that big a deal, but what\u2019s going on with that product in a little more detail in terms of the timing and your excitement for it and maybe a little more color on other apps that could be available at launch? And any expectations you have for it would be great.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Cook</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">My expectations are very high on it. I'm using it every day and love it and I can\u2019t live without it. So I see that we\u2019re making great progress on the development of it. The number of developers that are writing apps more for it are impressive and we\u2019re seeing some incredible innovation coming out there. And just to clarify, what we had been saying was early 2015, and we sort of look at the year and think of early as the first four months, mid is the next four months and late is the final four months. And so to us it's sort of within the range and it\u2019s basically when we thought. We\u2019re going to -- but most importantly we\u2019re going to be thrilled to start shipping it, because we got a lot of customers that are wanting to get one.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Benjamin Reitzes</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And then just a follow-up in terms of China. How do you feel the momentum there is in terms of sustainability versus some of the local competition, and as you navigate that market specifically going forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Cook</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">The local competition was obviously there this quarter and has been there for many quarters before. And so the local competition is not new. I think we did really well there. I'm very proud of how we\u2019re doing. I was there right after the launch in October. And the excitement around the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus were absolutely phenomenal. And you can see that in the results with Mainland China being up 100% year-on-year, despite not having a full quarter of sales since we launched in the second half of October.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">You can tell by that we\u2019re a big believer in China. We\u2019re looking at our investment. We\u2019re growing the number of stores. We\u2019ll hit 20 soon and we\u2019re doubling that by mid-2016 as Angela has said earlier and Luca said in his prepared comments as well. We\u2019re also growing the channel there. Our online store has expanded to over 350 cities now, and in fact our online revenues in China last quarter were more than the sum of the previous five years. And so it\u2019s an incredible market. I think people love Apple products and we are going to do our best to serve the market.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Nancy Paxton</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Could we have the next question please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">From Bernstein we\u2019ll hear from Toni Sacconaghi.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Toni Sacconaghi</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I was wondering if you could comment on your revenue guidance. Luca you mentioned the range as down 26% to 30% sequentially. I think if you look back over the last three or four Q1 to Q2s, revenues declined more in the 15% to 20% range. As you noted, your iPhone channel inventory is below your target range as well. So if anything, that might be going up. So I'm wondering if you could just discuss a little bit what factors are contributing to this steeper than normal decline this quarter, particularly given your ongoing enthusiasm for the phone.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Luca Maestri</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">First of all, it\u2019s a 20% year-over-year growth that we\u2019re guiding at the top end of the range. So we obviously feel good about a 20% growth. As we look at it on a sequential basis, there's a couple of things that I think is important to point out. I mentioned the foreign exchange headwinds. They are there. We need to deal with them, but they obviously are a negative to revenue. Those are headwinds that we had this year and were not there a year ago. So that\u2019s one factor.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">We\u2019ve also said the manufacturing ramp that we\u2019ve had this year in the December quarter has been the fastest that we\u2019ve ever had. And so that\u2019s also a factor that impacts the sequential compare. And then there's a couple of specific events that happened last year in the March quarter which are not going to repeat this year. One of them is the fact that last year in January we launched China Mobile and we had the subsequent channel sale for China Mobile. That of course is not going to repeat this year. And we also had a very, very strong quarter in Japan in the March quarter a year ago, which was driven by very significant carrier promotional activities, and a pull forward of sales into the March quarter in anticipation of a consumption tax increase that took place on April 1, and again that is not going to repeat. So when you take those factors into account, I think that explains the sequential decline that we see this year. Again I want to point out to the 20% year-over-year growth.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Toni Sacconaghi</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Luca just to confirm, sequentially my math is saying it's about two point incremental revenue headwind. Is that the right way to think about it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Luca Maestri</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">From FX?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Toni Sacconaghi</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yes. Currency.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Luca Maestri</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Right.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Toni Sacconaghi</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Sequentially, okay. Tim, I was wondering if I could have my -- direct my follow-up to you, which is the iPad. You\u2019ve spoken on prior calls about your enthusiasm for the product on a go forward basis. Over the last year it's down double-digits from a unit perspective and ASP has also been declining. So I was wondering if you could comment on whether your bullishness about the iPad persists and is it really -- do you believe it's a replacement cycle, that we will ultimately see that will start to drive growth or is there really innovation in product that is both necessary and forthcoming that\u2019s going to drive that growth?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Cook</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Toni, I am still very optimistic and bullish on iPad over the long run, as I\u2019ve indicated before. When you measure it in these 90-day clips, as we do in the short run, I don\u2019t think you're going to see a miraculous change in the -- or an improvement in the year-over-year. But here is what I see when I look at it and the reason that I'm so optimistic. I see that the first time buyer rates are very high. And so by very high, I mean that if you look in some of the developed market like the U.S., Japan, the UK, you would find that 50% of the people are buying an iPad for the first time. If you look in China, it's over 70%. And so that -- when you have that kind of first time buyer rates, you don\u2019t have a saturated market.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">When I look at the customer stat on iPad, it's literally off the charts, in some cases a 100%, which is unheard of in surveys to get these kind of customer stat ratings. When I look at the usage, the usage is six times our nearest competitor. The usage is defined as measured in web browsing is like 71% of total tablets, as I think Luca covered earlier. Also the commerce taking place across the iPad is enormous. Essentially over 80% of the commerce on tablets are taking place on iPad. And so when I back up and look at all of these, and I believe that over the long arc of time that the iPad is the great business, I also have visibility obviously of what\u2019s in the pipeline and feel very, very good about that. That said, I'm not projecting -- to be clear with everyone, I'm not projecting something very different next quarter or the next. I'm thinking over the long run.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">In terms of what I think is going on, I think what you said is absolutely true, that the upgrade cycle is longer. It's longer than an iPhone, probably between an iPhone and a PC. We haven\u2019t been in the business long enough to say that with certainty, but that\u2019s what we think. There is probably some level of cannibalization that's going on with the Mac on one side and the Phone on the other. And so you probably have a little bit of that that is shaking out. How much, very hard to tell on the early going, particularly since we just shipped the new phones a few months ago.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And so I think there's some things like that are going on. On the other side I think the partnership with IBM and the work that we have going on in the Enterprise is profound. I think we\u2019re really going to change the way people work. I'm really excited about the apps that are coming out and how fast the partnership is getting up and running.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And so I think that can move the dial there. And so I'm not predicting the 90-day clips and so forth, but over long arc of time I really believe that iPad is a great space, a great product and with -- also coupled with the product innovation we\u2019ve got, I think there is a very, very bright future for it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We'll go to Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gene Munster </span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">A couple of questions for Tim. First, any updates on Apple TV or your broader biz in the living room? And second a high level question about Apple Pay and some of the successes at point-of-sales. Can you talk a little bit about if in app is important or how important that is? And potentially how the product could evolve over time? Could you see this becoming more consumer to consumer or more just kind of a broader payment platform? Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Cook</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Gene, on Apple TV, we had a solid quarter with existing product. We\u2019ve sold 25 million Apple TVs now which at the sake of repeating myself, it\u2019s something that we continue to look at and work on and find a way that we can make even greater contribution than what we\u2019re doing. On Apple Pay, both the contactless payment and the in app are both important. I think they are both huge opportunities. I think they\u2019ll play out differently in different geographic regions as to which one is larger than the other and well likely -- the mix of those things will change over time as more and more commerce flows across apps and so forth.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">In terms of how it evolves, I think we're in the first inning on it. I'm not -- we haven\u2019t even completed the first inning yet. There's tons of things on our roadmap of adding functionality to it. We\u2019re obviously -- we're just in the U.S. right now and so there's tons of countries to go to and there is not a day that goes by that I don\u2019t get notes from many businesses outside U.S. running Apple Pay and banks and merchants.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And of course we still have a lot of merchants left in the U.S. But I have to tell you that given that we\u2019ve launched in October, I'm actually unbelievably shocked, positively shocked at how many merchants were able to implement Apple Pay in the heart of their holiday season, because generally most people sort of lock down and don\u2019t do very much. But we were able to get this in a lot of different merchants and I give them a lot of credit for that. But I think we\u2019re just on the front end. And I think that this is the year of Apple Pay. And some of the things you mentioned and others are all things that we\u2019re looking at and in many cases working on in terms of where it can take us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Nancy Paxton</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Thank you, Gene. Could we have the next question please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">From JPMorgan we\u2019ll go to Rod Hall.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Rod Hall</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So I wanted to start off Tim. You talked about the smaller of the user base who have upgraded to iPhone 6 or 6 Plus. And I wonder if you could give us a little bit more color on that, maybe even go as far as quantifying how many of the base you think have upgraded and also talk a little bit about the pattern of upgrades? Are they all tending to be over iPhones or is there are good spread? Can you give us any further color on that? Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Cook</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">It\u2019s a small fraction. It\u2019s a number that's in the mid-teens or barely in the teens. And so when I look at that I say that there is an enormous amount left. And given there are fair amount of Android units out there, there is also an enormous amount of Android customers that could switch. And I\u2019d also remind you that there is a lot of people that have not yet bought a smartphone. And I know it doesn\u2019t feel like that when you\u2019re sitting in the United States, but from a worldwide point of view there's still lots of them. And so I see all three of those groups there and I'm very excited about all of them, and serving all of them.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Rod Hall</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And then my follow up I\u2019d like to direct at Luca. Luca, I wonder, could you talk a little bit about the duration of the hedge contracts and the renewal pattern that we should expect to see this year? Just kind of remind us what your typical renewal pattern is and will you be accelerating that this year given all the currency movement?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Luca Maestri</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes Rod. Typically, I think, we have clearly active hedging programs of winning the market almost every day, but we tend to hedge three to 12 months out. There are cases where maybe we\u2019ve had to go a bit longer, if we feel that we have a strong conviction about certain currencies. Otherwise again the typical period is three to 12 months. And as hedges roll off, we replace them with new hedges. We take into account the exposures that we have around the world, taking into account our most recent forecast and we hedge accordingly. We feel very good about our hedging position and the decisions that we\u2019ve made particularly during the summer when we felt that maybe we needed to hedge a bit more than we have done historically.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Cook</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">It\u2019s probably worth pointing out too that there is some markets where we can\u2019t economically hedge.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Luca Maestri</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes. There are some exposures where the cost of hedging is prohibitive or the financial instruments are not there to hedge. And in those cases of course that\u2019s where you get the full impact of the volatility.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Nancy Paxton</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thanks Rod. Could we have the next question please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">From RBC Capital Markets we\u2019ll go to Amit Daryanani.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Amit Daryanani</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I just have two questions. One maybe just on the gross margin side. I want to understand, the 100 basis points of headwind that you're talking about in the March quarter, is that sort of is -- there is some still protection on the hedges or is that a raw number with no hedges in place?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Luca Maestri</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">That\u2019s correct. I think its good clarification. I was talking about the net impact after the hedges. The impact without hedges would be higher. And again this is sequentially right. Because on a year-over-year basis actually the impact is larger, given the fact that currencies have moved during the last 12 months. But the 100 basis points that I quoted includes the mitigating impact of the hedging program.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Amit Daryanani</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And just, when you think about the iPad and you talked about the IBM partnership where you're seeing some traction. Could you just talk about what sort of penetration do you guys think iPads have on an enterprise side right now and how do you see that improve over the next few quarters as you roll out the MobileFirst modules with IBM.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Cook</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">We think that what we know, that if you look at the Fortune 500 as an example, we\u2019re in essentially all of the Fortune 500 companies. So the issue is not that, and it\u2019s not a market share number, because our market share is extremely high. The issue is that enterprises, generally speaking are only deploying iPads to a small percentage of their workforce. And so the real opportunity is to bring mobility into the enterprises and change how people work. In order to do that, you obviously need apps that are written to specific jobs, not just apps that are general productivity apps like work processors and spreadsheets and presentation tools et cetera.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And so that\u2019s one of the things that working with IBM provides us, is both that and the knowledge of the verticals, which they bring a significant amount of knowledge on all of the verticals that I mentioned earlier. And so where can we take that to? I think if we can really change the way people work, I think the opportunity is enormous. We\u2019re not hanging numbers out there to be measured on at this point, but we don\u2019t do a lot of big partnerships as you probably know. And so when we do one, it is significant and it\u2019s because we really believe in it, and we really believe in this one and what it can do for customers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Nancy Paxton</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Thank you Amit. Can we have the next question please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">From Deutsche Bank we\u2019ll hear from Sherri Scribner.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Sherri Scribner</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Luca, I was hoping you can give us some detail on your expectations for operating expenses going forward. I know you\u2019ve been investing pretty significantly in new products, but wanted to see how we should think about those trending over the next couple of quarters?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Luca Maestri</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Sherry, as you know, we provide guidance just for the upcoming quarter. And from what you\u2019ve seen from our guidance for the March quarter, we\u2019re guiding to a growth in OpEx on a year-over-year basis that is similar to what we\u2019ve experienced during the course of the December quarter. We obviously feel good about the business during the December quarter. Our revenue exceeded in terms of growth, our growth in operating expenses. There's going to be quarters where the opposite is going to happen. Our expense to revenue ratio during the December quarter was that 7.4%. It was the lowest that we\u2019ve had in two years. It\u2019s among the lowest ratios that we\u2019ve ever had. But obviously we are investing in the business and we will never under invest in the business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">The majority of the increase will continue to come from R&amp;D, given the fact that we\u2019ve expanded our product portfolio and we\u2019re making investments all the time ahead of the revenue that would be generated in the future. We also expect to continue to invest in marketing and advertising. We\u2019re expanding distribution all over the world. We\u2019ve taken our brand to more places and we continue to open new retail stores around the world. And so the idea for us is to continue to invest in the business, making the right trade-offs and the results from the December quarter give us very good confidence for the future.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Nancy Paxton</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Could we have the next question please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">We\u2019ll go to Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Bill Shope</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I wanted to follow up on your previous comments on the iPhone and the customer composition for the quarter. Considering the iPhone 6 Plus brought you into entirely new segment of smartphone market, can you give us a bit more color on that customer composition for this device? Specifically you mentioned the differences in geographic adoption, but how about on the Android switcher comments you made earlier, and first time adopters relative to the traditional iPhone 6 and your other iPhone models in the past. And I guess related to that, what do you think this tells you about your ASP and unit opportunity for growth in 2015?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Cook</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Bill, at this point, just shortly after the quarter, we don\u2019t have all of our research in from all of the people that bought last quarter. But in the aggregate, as I've mentioned before, we saw more new customers to iPhone than we had ever seen before. And we had a higher rate of Android switchers than we had in the three previous launches. And it\u2019s not that we had more in the fourth one, and I don\u2019t what those numbers are, and whether it's something we're looking at. And so between the switchers and the people that are just new to smartphones and selected an iPhone, and our upgrades, which we\u2019re very happy with, but represent a small fraction of our installed base, we feel really great about what\u2019s in front of us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Bill Shope</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Makes sense. And then a follow up on your Apple Pay commentary. When we look at the opportunity outside of the U.S. are there unique hurdles we should consider as we think about the timing of the rollouts in Europe and Asia, or is it really just about following partnerships together?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Cook</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Each has a different implementation. And so in some ways, like there is a different set of carriers in every country, there is a different set of banks. In a lot of the countries, some of the processes with the merchants are different. And so it\u2019s an area where there is quite a bit of difference country to country to country and so there's clearly heavy lifting involved to scale. However it\u2019s not something that scares us or that\u2019s preventing us from viewing it as a big opportunity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Thank you, Bill. A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks as a podcast on the iTunes Store, as a webcast on apple.com/investor and via telephone and the numbers for the telephone replay are 888-203-1112 or 719-457-0820 and please enter a confirmation code 8259681.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And these replays will be available by approximately 5.00 PM Pacific Time today.

{"Apple's (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook on Q2 2015 Results - Earnings Call Transcript": ["<p class=\"p p1\">Apple (NASDAQ:<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL\" title=\"Apple Inc.\">AAPL</a>)</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Q1 2015 Results Earnings Conference Call</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">April 27, 2015, 5:00 p.m. ET</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Executives</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Nancy Paxton - Senior Director, IR</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Tim Cook - CEO</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Luca Maestri - SVP and CFO</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Analysts</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Bill Schultz - Goldman Sachs</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Katie Huberty - Morgan Stanley</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Tony Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Shannon Cross - Cross Research</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Steve Milunovich - UBS</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Kulbinder Garcha - Credit Suisse</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good day everyone, and welcome to this Apple Incorporated second quarter fiscal year 2015 earnings release conference call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple's CEO Tim Cook, and he will be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. After that, we\u2019ll open the call to questions from analysts.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Please note that some of the information you\u2019ll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margins, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, future business outlook, and plans for dividends, share repurchases, and public debt issuance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple\u2019s Form 10-K for 2014, the Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2015, and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press releases.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good afternoon everyone, and thanks for joining us. We have a lot of great news to talk about, so I\u2019ll jump right in. Today, we\u2019re reporting our strongest March quarter ever, with 27% revenue growth and 40% earnings per share growth year over year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We\u2019re seeing fantastic results for iPhone, with revenue growth of 55% year on year, and we\u2019re seeing a higher rate of switchers than we\u2019ve experienced in previous iPhone cycles. The success of iPhone has been extremely strong in emerging markets, where unit sales were up 63% year on year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">The App Store had its best quarter ever, with a record number of customers making purchases, driving a new record for revenue and 29% year on year growth. We also reached an all-time quarterly record of $5 billion in total services revenue.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We also continue to defy the trend of declining global PC sales, with double digit Mac unit growth in a market that IVC estimates contracted by 7%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We\u2019re now halfway through fiscal 2015 and our year to date results have been simply staggering. We sold over 135 million iPhones, 34 million iPads, and 10 million Macs in the first six months of the year. Our revenue has grown by 28% to over $132 billion, net income has increased 36% to over $31 billion, and EPS has grown by 44%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We\u2019re making many strategic investments in Apple\u2019s future, in research and development, in our supply chain, and in our infrastructure, and we\u2019ve made 27 acquisitions in the last six quarters. We\u2019re in the very fortunate position of generating more cash than we need to run our business, and keep making these important investments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">So today, we\u2019re announcing another significant update to our capital return program, expanding its size to $200 billion through March of 2017 to reflect our strong confidence in what lies ahead for Apple. Luca will go into this in more detail in a moment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We\u2019re also making great progress in many other areas. The Apple ecosystem continues to expand in exciting ways. We\u2019re seeing great momentum with Apple Pay. Discover announced today that its cardmembers in the United States will be able to make contactless payments in participating stores through Apple Pay beginning this fall.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">And last month, we said that the number of locations accepting Apple Pay has tripled, and we continue to see great progress with merchants. Best Buy, which has been a longtime, strong partner of ours, has just announced that it\u2019s now offering Apple Pay in-app and later this year will offer Apple Pay in all of their U.S. stores.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">And merchants aren\u2019t the only ones jumping onboard. Earlier this month, a leading healthcare payment network announced acceptance of Apple Pay for its clients, so over 50 major hospitals across the country, including Stanford Healthcare and Aspen Valley, will accept Apple Pay this year for copays and bill payments at registration and check in.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We\u2019re also incredibly inspired by the momentum we\u2019re seeing in health-related solutions. Since we released HealthKit with iOS 8 last September, over 1,000 apps have been developed to transform how people track, manage, and interact with their health and they\u2019re now available on the App Store.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Just this past weekend, Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles turned on the largest HealthKit integration to date, giving more than 87,000 patients the ability to share their health and fitness data seamlessly with their MyCS link app, which syncs with their electronic medical record.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">And last month we announced ResearchKit, an open source software framework that helps doctors and scientists gather data from medical research participants more efficiently and accurately using iPhone applications. The response so far has been simply amazing, far exceeding our expectations.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">The first research apps developed using ResearchKit study asthma, breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and Parkinson\u2019s disease, and have enrolled over 60,000 iPhone users in just the first few weeks of being available on the App Store.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Over 1,000 researchers have contacted us expressing interest in performing studies through ResearchKit. We think these types of solutions have the potential to revolutionize medical studies in life-changing ways, and we\u2019re proud that Apple is helping make this possible.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Last quarter, we also announced a major economic investment in Europe, where we will spend $2 billion to build data centers in Ireland and Denmark. These will be our largest data centers in the world.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Apple is now responsible for creating over 670,000 jobs across the European continent. Most of them have grown out of the success of the App Store, which has generated more than $7.5 billion for European developers since just 2008. We feel great about the economic contribution we\u2019ve been able to make in Europe.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">The two data centers we\u2019re building will run on 100% renewable energy from day one. This is just part of the work we\u2019re doing to protect the environment and leave the world better than we found it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Today, 100% of Apple\u2019s U.S. operations and 87% of global operations are powered by renewable energy. Just before Earth Day, we announced our plan to move to renewables in China. We\u2019re undertaking a groundbreaking partnership with several companies to build a 40 megawatt solar farm in Szechuan Province that will generate far more than the amount of energy used by all of our offices and retail stores in China combined.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We also announced an innovative new partnership with the Conservation Fund to permanently protect more than 36,000 acres of working forest in Maine and North Carolina to help offset the impact our packaging has on the world\u2019s supply of sustainable virgin fiber. Apple is deeply committed to these initiatives and will continue to make them a priority.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">The June quarter is off to an exciting start with great new products and services. Three of them in particular are giving our customers a glimpse of the future and we are very happy with the reception that each of them is receiving.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">First, the all-new MacBook began shipping just over two weeks ago, and we are very happy with the response we\u2019re getting from customers. The new MacBook is our lightest, most compact Mac notebook ever, and you really have to see it to believe it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">It features a stunning 12 inch retina display, a new force touch trackpad, all day battery life, and a revolutionary new keyboard. We believe, and I think most everyone agrees, this is the future of the notebook.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Second is the new streaming service from HBO, which is available on Apple TV and iOS. We teamed up with HBO last month to help launch HBO Now, a standalone service that lets customers stream the content they love from HBO on the devices they love from Apple, all without requiring a subscription to cable. HBO now has been incredibly popular with Apple TV users since its debut, and it has been one of the top downloaded apps on the U.S. App Store as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">And third, of course, is Apple Watch. It\u2019s been really great to see the reaction of customers since their watches began arriving on Friday morning. All around the world, we\u2019ve seen the excitement on social networks as people start using their Apple Watch. The response has been overwhelmingly positive.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Adding to the surprise and delight of Apple Watch are the more than 3,500 apps that are already available. Our developer community has already seen the potential in this new category and put some of their best thinking into what wearable technology can do. We can\u2019t wait to see more of the inspiring apps developers dream up for Apple Watch as we head into our Worldwide Developer Conference six weeks from now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">I\u2019d like to thank all of those developers and our hundreds of millions of customers for their loyalty and support. I\u2019d also like to thank all of the Apple employees around the world for their creativity, tireless effort, and passion for delivering the very best products in the world.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Luca.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"><strong>Luca Maestri </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone. As Tim mentioned, we just completed another outstanding quarter. Revenue for the March quarter was $58 billion, an increase of $12.4 billion or 27% year over year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Growth was driven primarily by the very strong performance of iPhone and the continued strength of the App Store and Mac sales. We achieved these terrific results despite growing foreign exchange headwinds.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Our performance was particularly impressive in our Greater China and rest of Asia Pacific segments. In Greater China, we established an all-time quarterly record for revenue, which grew 71% year over year, to $16.8 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Gross margin was 40.8%, ahead of our expectations, mainly due to stronger than expected iPhone results. Operating margin was 31.5% of revenue and net income was $13.6 billion, a new Q2 record.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Diluted earnings per share were $2.33, a 40% year over year increase, and cash flow from operations was $19.1 billion, also a new March quarter record. For details by product, I will start with iPhone.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We sold 61.2 million iPhones in the quarter, representing 40% year over year growth and demand for iPhone 6 and 6 plus has remained incredibly strong. IPhone sales more than doubled in Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, and Vietnam, and they were up 80% or more in several other markets including Canada, Mexico, Germany, and Turkey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">The strong mix of iPhone 6 and 6 plus combined with the popularity of higher capacity offerings led to iPhone ASPs of $659, an increase of $62 year over year, despite the very significant foreign exchange headwinds I already mentioned.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We increased iPhone channel inventory by 1 million units during the quarter, which allowed us to get into the low end of our target range of 5 to 7 weeks of channel inventory.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Next, I\u2019d like to talk about the Mac. We sold 4.6 million Macs, representing 10% year over year growth, which is particularly impressive in the context of IDC\u2019s latest estimate of a 7% global PC market contraction. The growth was led by portables and spurred by the updates to MacBook Air and MacBook Pro in March. We ended the quarter within our 4 to 5 week target range for Mac channel inventory.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to iPad, we sold 12.6 million, compared to 16.4 million in the year ago quarter. iPad sellthrough was 13.7 million, as we reduced channel inventory by about 1.1 million units, coming off the holiday quarter. This left us within our 5 to 7 week target range of iPad channel inventory.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We set a new March quarter record for iPad sales in Japan, and an all-time record for iPad sales in China, but performance in other markets was more muted during the quarter. iPad turns five years old this month, and in every year since its introduction, it has been the number one tablet in sales, in quantity and quality of tablet apps, in usage, and most importantly, in customer satisfaction. And based on the latest data from NPD, iPad maintains a very strong leadership share in all the price bands where we compete.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">iPad has also consistently been the number one tablet in enterprise. A recent Changewave survey found that among corporate buyers planning to buy tablets in the next six months, 77% plan to purchase iPads. In fact, we are seeing very high interest from companies who want to use iPads to transform how work gets done.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">The vast majority of the app opportunities that have been identified as part of the Apple and IBM partnership are specifically for iPad. In addition to IBM, we working closely with more than two dozen other leading business software and solution providers including Box, Docusign, Microstrategy, Revel, and ServiceMax to bring a broad range of innovative mobile solutions to more customers on iPad.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to services, revenue grew to a new all-time record of $5 billion, an increase of 9% year over year. The growth was led by the App Store, which remains incredibly popular with our customers around the world, with revenue up 29% in the March quarter. According to App Annie, the App Store generated 70% more global revenue in the March quarter than Google Play, up from a 60% lead in the September quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Traffic to our retail and online stores was excellent, with a 22% year over year increase in customer visits. We\u2019re progressing well with our plans for retail store expansion in Greater China, where we added six new stores in the past quarter alone, bringing us to 21 stores in 11 cities. We\u2019re on track to have 40 stores open in Greater China by the middle of next year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $193.5 billion in cash, plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $15.6 billion. Over $171 billion of this cash was offshore. In the March quarter, we issued 6.5 billion U.S. dollar denominated notes and 1.3 billion Swiss franc denominated notes as we continue to diversify our global debt investor base.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We\u2019ve now raised a total of $40 billion of term debt at very attractive rates. We spent $7 billion to repurchase 56.4 million Apple shares through open market transactions, paid $2.7 billion in dividends and equivalents, and utilized about $100 million to [net share] settle vesting employee RSUs. We also retired an additional 13.3 million shares during the quarter, with the conclusion of the accelerated share repurchase program we launched last August.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We have executed our capital return program aggressively, and we\u2019ve now taken action on over $112 billion of our $130 billion program, including $80 billion in share repurchases at an average price of $85.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As we\u2019ve said consistently, creating value for shareholders by developing great products that enrich people\u2019s lives will always be our top priority and the key factor driving our investments and our capital allocation decisions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">With this framework in mind, Apple\u2019s board and management team continue to review capital allocation regularly, and we solicit input on our program from a broad base of shareholders. This process allows us to be thoughtful about the size, the mix, and the pace of the program. We very much appreciate all the input that many shareholders have provided us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We continue to be in the fortunate position of being able to return significant capital to shareholders. We first announced our capital return program three years ago with an initial size of $45 billion, and we\u2019ve increased it annually since then. Today, we\u2019re announcing the third update to our program, expanding its size by the largest amount yet and extending its duration.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">The existing program was set to conclude at the end of this calendar year, and we\u2019re now extending the program by five quarters to the end of March 2017. Once again, with this update we\u2019re allocating the majority of the expansion of the program to share repurchases, given our strong confidence in the future of Apple and the value we see in our stock.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">The board has increased the share repurchase authorization by $50 billion, raising it from the current $90 billion to $140 billion. We will also continue to net share settle vesting employee restricted stock units.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We also understand that the dividend is very important to many of our investors and we\u2019re raising it for the third time in less than three years. The quarterly dividend will grow from $0.47 per share to $0.52 per share, an increase of 11%. This effective with our next dividend, which the board has declared today and is payable on May 14, 2015 to shareholders of record as of May 11, 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We believe this is a meaningful increase for those shareholders who value income, and we continue to plan for annual dividend increases going forward. With over $11 billion in annual dividend payments, we\u2019re proud to be one of the largest dividend payers in the world. In total, the size of our revised capital return program will increase by over 50%, from approximately $130 billion to $200 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">As we\u2019ve done in the past, we expect to fund our capital return program with U.S. cash, future U.S. cash flow generation, and borrowing from both domestic and international debt markets. And we plan to provide the next update on our program at about this time next year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Now, as we move ahead into the June quarter, I\u2019d like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $46 billion and $48 billion, compared to $37.4 billion in the year ago quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 38.5% and 39.5%. We expect opex to be between $5.65 billion and $5.75 billion. We expect YNE to be about $350 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 26.3%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">With that, let\u2019s open the call to questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Nancy Paxton </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Thank you, and we ask that you limit yourself to one one-part question and one follow up. Operator, may we have the first question, please?</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p5\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">[Operator instructions.] Your first question will come from Bill Schultz, Goldman Sachs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Q \u2013 Bill Schultz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">When we look at the effect of currency on your gross profit, which I think was far less than anyone anticipated, have you be able to reduce some of the pressure by adjusting the terms of your suppliers? Or is that something we should expect to see more of as you progress through the year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>A \u2013 Luca Maestri </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">I\u2019m gonna give you some numbers on the currency, because I know it\u2019s a topic that is top of mind. You\u2019re asking about gross margin, and you know, we look at this on a sequential basis. And I mentioned during the call in January that we were expecting FX to have a negative impact on a sequential basis of about 100 basis points after the effect of the hedges.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">And that is exactly what happened in our actual results. So that was pretty much in line with what we were anticipating. Of course, we expect this headwind to continue. And on a sequential basis, when we look into the June quarter, we expect to see another 40 basis points of negative impact from currency.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We\u2019re dealing with these headwinds. They\u2019re part of business, and so we\u2019re dealing with them in many ways. We are looking at, in some cases, at the potential to increase prices in certain markets. We\u2019re looking of course at our cost structure, and we try to remain as competitive as possible.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So we feel very good about the gross margins that we\u2019ve generated in the March quarter, and we feel very good about the guidance that we provided, given the severity of the impact.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Q \u2013 Bill Schultz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">And then as a follow up, obviously, I guess one of the incremental tailwinds to gross margin continues to be the iPhone upside relative to expectations. Can you give us a bit more color on the dynamics of the customer mix for the iPhone? You had mentioned you\u2019re very excited about the new iPhone rate so far, but if you could just give us a bit more color, as we had last quarter, on folks that are new to iPhone, Android switchers, versus replacements?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>A \u2013 Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Bill, we continue to see a higher rate of switchers than we have seen in previous cycles, and so we\u2019re extremely excited about that. We also continue to see a reasonable percentage of first time buyers, particularly in some of the emerging markets. And if you look at emerging markets in general, I think Luca covered some of this, the revenue from emerging markets, just for the March quarter, was up 58% year on year. And a big piece of what is driving that is iPhone. Obviously, those results would have been higher without some of the FX headwinds that Luca mentioned earlier.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We\u2019ll hear from Katie Huberty with Morgan Stanley.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Q \u2013 Katie Huberty</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">You\u2019ve said in the past that the watch may take longer to ramp given the new category and new interface to customers. Is that in fact playing out? Is the watch ramping slower than past product categories?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>A \u2013 Tim Cook </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Katie, when you use the word \u201cramp,\u201d I assume you\u2019re talking about supply?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Q \u2013 Katie Huberty </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Yeah, preorders and first week in sales, and any other data points that you track in terms of interest versus, say, when the iPad launched in 2010.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>A \u2013 Tim Cook </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Let me talk about supply and demand and sort of separate those two. Right now, demand is greater than supply. And so we\u2019re working hard to remedy that. We\u2019ve made progress over the last week or so, and we were able to deliver more customers an Apple Watch over the weekend than we had initially anticipated.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We\u2019re going to keep doing that, and so we\u2019ve already sent some notes out today, moving the customers and versus what we had communicated to them previously. So I\u2019m generally happy that we\u2019re moving on with the ramp. It is a new product for us, and with any kind of new product, you wind up taking some time to fully ramp.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Having said that, I think we\u2019re in a good position and by sometime in late June, we currently anticipate being in a position that we could begin to sell the Apple Watch in additional countries. And so that\u2019s our current plan.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">From a demand point of view, it\u2019s hard to gauge when you don\u2019t have product in stores and so forth. So we\u2019re filling orders completely online at the moment. The customer response from people that have gotten theirs over the weekend have been overwhelmingly positive, and we\u2019re far ahead of where we expected to be from an application point of view.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">To give you a comparison, when we launched the iPhone, we had about 500 apps that were ready. When we launched iPad, we had about a thousand. And so our internal goal was to be able to beat the thousand level, and we thought it would be great if we were able to do that by a little bit. And as I mentioned before, we now have over 3,500 apps in the App Store for the watch.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">And so we couldn\u2019t be happier about how things are going from that point of view. We are learning quickly about customer preferences between the different configurations. There\u2019s a much larger breadth of possibilities here for customers than in our other products. And in some cases, we called that well. In some cases, we\u2019re making adjustments to get in line with demand. But I\u2019m really confident that this is something we really understand how to do and will do.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And so I\u2019m really happy where we are currently, and happy enough that we\u2019re looking forward to expanding into more countries in late June.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Q \u2013 Katie Huberty </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And then as a follow up, research and development spend continues to track well ahead of revenue growth. And that has happened for many quarters now. Can you talk about what\u2019s driving that? Is there a broader set of projects that you\u2019re working on? Are you making bigger bets, entering bigger markets? What\u2019s driving such a long period of elevated R&amp;D spend?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>A \u2013 Luca Maestri </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Of course, we\u2019ve said this several times now. When you look at our current product portfolio, it is much broader than it used to be. We\u2019ve now developed two new iPhones over the year. We were not doing that a few years ago. Developed two iPads. And of course now we have the Apple Watch.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">We\u2019re also developing some core foundational technologies more in house now than we were in the past. And of course we\u2019re also spending ahead of some of the products that will generate revenues in the future. So when you combined all these factors, that is the reason why you see these research and development increases year over year. Research and development is the core of the company. Innovation is the core of the company.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And we\u2019re very proud of the fact, when you look, for example, at the last two quarters, the first half of 2015, our revenue growth has been higher than our opex growth. And when you look at our expense to revenue ratio, which, for the first half of the year, has been 8.2%, it\u2019s lower than it was a year ago, and it\u2019s definitely something that we consider extremely competitive, and we\u2019re very proud of.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">From Piper Jaffray, we\u2019ll hear from Gene Munster.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Q \u2013 Gene Munster</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Tim, you mentioned there\u2019s more switchers versus previous cycles. Any thoughts on what that would mean or could mean for market share over the next few quarters, and kind of I guess the sustainability of the 6 cycle? And then second question, for Luca, in terms of any thoughts on what the margin impact from the watch is that ramps over the next couple of years?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Cook </span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Gene, if you look at the overall worldwide, we grew iPhone 40%. And IDC\u2019s estimate of the market for last quarter is a 16%, so we grew two and a half times. And if you kind of look through at the different countries, in almost every country, we grew at a multiple of the market.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And as I mentioned before, in emerging markets, we did extremely well. And so I feel really good about where we are, and you can hopefully tell with the strong guidance that we provided, that we\u2019re very bullish on the current quarter as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And so I think things look very, very good. We\u2019re also pleased, in addition to the switcher number, that we\u2019re doing fairly well with first time buyers, which is also a key metric for us. And so it\u2019s tough to find something in the numbers not to like.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Luca Maestri </span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And Gene, let me take your question on margins. I\u2019ll talk about Q3, because you know, this is the period that we provide guidance for. And we guided to 38.5% to 39.5%, which is slightly down versus our performance in Q2. And this is driven by a number of things. First of all, it\u2019s the loss of leverage from the sequential decline in revenue. This is typical of our seasonality.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">There\u2019s a foreign exchange element, and I mentioned before the negative impact on a sequential basis about 40 basis points. And also, we\u2019re launching the Apple Watch. Apple Watch is not only a new product, but it\u2019s a brand new category with a lot of new features, a lot of new, innovative technologies. And Apple Watch margins will be lower than company average.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gene Munster </span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">One maybe quick follow up, Tim, in terms of the base of iPhones that have upgraded. I think you provided a number last quarter on that. Is there any update to that metric?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Cook </span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yeah, sure. Our current estimate is that about 20% of the active installed base has upgraded to a 6 or 6 plus. And so as I look at that number, that suggests there\u2019s plenty of upgrade headroom in addition to we want to keep inviting over as many switchers as we can. So between both of those and the first time buyers as well, it seems really, really good right now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And that will come from Tony Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Tony Sacconaghi</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I just wanted to revisit the watch. Tim, I think you\u2019ve said, when you were talking about your new products, you said we\u2019re \u201cvery happy with the reception\u201d and in response to a previous answer, you said, \u201crelative to demand, it\u2019s hard to gauge with no product in the stores.\u201d I would say relative to other product launches, where your commentary around demand was characterized by superlative after superlative, that assessment feels very modest.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And part of the reason that I ask is A) are we reading you right in terms of that, but if we look at consensus, consensus is expecting that Apple will ship more watches in its first two quarters than it did iPad, despite, as you said, very limited distribution in terms of only selling through your store.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So I\u2019m wondering if you could talk a little bit about putting those demand comments in context given that they do seem different from how you\u2019ve characterized product demand for other products, and how, if at all, we should think about modeling demand in the context, perhaps, of the iPad, which was your most recent significant new category.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Cook </span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I\u2019m thrilled with it, Tony, so I don\u2019t want you to read anything I\u2019m saying any way other than that. So I\u2019m not sure how to say that any clearer than that. And in any situation, whether it\u2019s the watch or in the past on iPad or on iPhone, when demand is much greater than supply, it\u2019s difficult to gauge exactly what it is.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And so as you know, we don\u2019t make long term forecasts on here. We make forecasts for the current quarter. And so I don\u2019t want to make any comment about the consensus numbers. Honestly, I haven\u2019t even studied those. We\u2019ve got enough to think about here.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I feel really great about it. The customer response, literally, from what I\u2019ve seen, is close to 100% positive. And so it\u2019s hard to imagine it being better.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Tony Sacconaghi </span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">You talked about the watch having lower margins in the third quarter, which is surprising A) I think in the context of price points that many people thought were higher, B) in the context of what luxury watches sell for, C) I think in terms of what estimated margins might be installed on accessories like your watch band.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So I\u2019m wondering if you believe that the watch\u2019s gross margins are being burdened by lower volumes and startup costs, and that you believe that as a category, watch margins will be, in total, including everything else that you sell with it, on a sustained basis, lower than the company average.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Cook </span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Tony, we\u2019re not going to guide to or give projections of gross margin outside of the current quarter. And so what we have right now, which is a situation, it\u2019s not surprising to us, we knew we would be here, is that the watch gross margins for the current quarter that we\u2019ve included in the guidance that Luca\u2019s provided in the aggregate, are lower than the company average. And so that to us is intuitive that they would be. And so I think we must be just looking at it through a different lens than you are.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Tony Sacconaghi </span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I guess the question is is there anything unique about it being in its first quarter that it\u2019s providing that margin profile?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Cook </span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">In the first quarter with any new kind of product, you would always have learning and these sorts of things. We\u2019ve had this with every product we\u2019ve ever done. And so again, we\u2019re not guiding to what it will be over time. We\u2019re talking about what it is now. But you know, I would keep in mind that the functionality of the product that we\u2019re making is absolutely incredible, the power of it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And I haven\u2019t even seen this, but generally, there\u2019s cost breakdowns that come out around our products that are much different than the reality. I\u2019ve never seen one that is anywhere close to being accurate. And so if that\u2019s the basis for your comment, I\u2019d really dig on the data if I were you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">We\u2019ll go to Shannon Cross with Cross Research.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Shannon Cross </span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Tim, can you talk a bit about what you\u2019re seeing in China with 70% year over year growth in the Greater China revenue, and clearly very strong iPhone. If you can talk a bit about what consumers are saying, what the carriers are saying, in terms of demand and opportunity. Just any color, because clearly it\u2019s quite strong.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Cook </span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yeah, it was an incredible quarter. We were up 71% year over year. We set a record in China for revenues. We did that now in a quarter that included Chinese New Year, and so we have the help of a strong holiday season, much like the U.S. has a strong season in December. China\u2019s is obviously in the March quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">iPhone led the way. It was up over 70% year on year. And the current estimates from Kantar are that that would mean that we would gain more than 9 points of share on a year over year basis. And so by everything I can see, we did extremely well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">The Mac also had an unbelievable quarter in China, and I\u2019m particularly very happy with this, that Mac unit sales were up 31%. And like the rest of the world, or most of the rest of the world, IDC is projecting that PC sales in China contracted by 5% last quarter. And so once again bucking the tide.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Also, in China, consistent with the company but at a much different rate, the App Store had a record quarter and grew over 100% year over year. And so you can see the iPhone, the Mac, and the App Store adding, and with the iPad in PRC, not in Greater China, but in the PRC, iPad had its best quarter ever, higher than all the others, and also grew in a market that contracted for the overall market.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And so really and truly, it\u2019s sort of everything you look at in China was extremely good. We have been working significantly on expanding our ecosystem there, and so we added Union Pay as a payment option for customers. We increased the iPhone point of sales to over 40,000 during the quarter. That\u2019s up about 9% year on year. And more importantly than the total number, we are in many more cities than we were before.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">We worked significantly on our online store. Our online store revenue was up over three times year over year. As you probably heard us say before, we\u2019ve opened several stores in China recently. We\u2019re now at 21 in Greater China and we\u2019re on track still to achieve 40 stores by the middle of next year. The online store will also be expanding from around 319 cities to where they can hit two day delivery to 365 cities. So adding about 50 new cities by the end of this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And so the net is we\u2019re investing a lot across the board in our infrastructure, in our products, on partnering with different companies. The Chinese developers are coming on in significant numbers. We\u2019ve now made payments to developers in Greater China of almost $5 billion over half of which was in the last 12 months.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And so you can see this enormous momentum building in the developer community there as well. And so lots of positive things, and you know, as you probably heard me say before, I\u2019ve never seen as many people coming into the middle class as they are in China. And that\u2019s where the bulk of our sales are going. And so we\u2019re really proud of the results there and continue to invest in the country.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Shannon Cross </span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And just sort of a follow up on the iPad side. What do you think it\u2019s going to take to reaccelerate iPads? The sellthrough was better than the sell in this quarter, but are we seeing cannibalization from the iPhone 6 plus and how are you sort of thinking about the IBM partnership as it relates to iPad?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Cook </span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Number one, we have to stop having the situations where we sell through more than we sell in, where we don\u2019t have to have an inventory correction. That was over a million units. Two, have we had cannibalization? The answer is yes. We\u2019re clearly seeing cannibalization from iPhone and on the other side, from the Mac. And of course, as I\u2019ve said before, we\u2019ve never worried about that. It is what it is. That will play out, and at some point, it will stabilize. I\u2019m not sure precisely when, but I\u2019m pretty confident that it will.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">The IBM partnership, I think, is in its early stages in terms of bearing fruit here, but everything I see I like on it. I\u2019m a big believer in the ability for iPad to play in a major way in enterprise. And so I\u2019m looking forward to seeing that play out as we move forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">If you look at the underlying data, it makes you feel a lot better than the sales do. And so things like first time buyer rates, the latest numbers from the U.S. are somewhere around 40%. And if you look at China, they\u2019re almost 70%. And so these numbers are not numbers that you would get if the market were saturated. And so I continue to believe, even though I\u2019ve seen people write that, that I think that theory is not correct, and do not see that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We also see usage numbers that are off the charts, so far above competition it\u2019s not even in the same planet. And we see customer satisfaction at or near 100%. And so these kind of numbers, along with intent to buy numbers, everything looks fantastic, the ecommerce numbers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And so my belief is that as the inventory plays out, as we make some continued investments in our product pipeline, which we\u2019re doing, that we already have planned and have had planned for some time, between that, the inventory playing out, the enterprise starting to take over, I think still I believe the iPad is an extremely good business over the long term. When precisely it begins to grow again I wouldn\u2019t want to predict, but I strongly believe that it will.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">From UBS, we\u2019ll go to Steve Milunovich.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steve Milunovich</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Luca, could you comment a bit about the factors that went into your decision on the capital return program, particularly the share repurchase part? For example, I would think you\u2019re pretty well done in terms of taking U.S. cash down. So you are dependent upon cash flow in the U.S. as well as debt. And regarding debt, do you have a debt to EBITDA ratio in mind that you don\u2019t want to go over? Do you want to keep your AA rating? Is that important? Just other factors like capital spending needs, just curious what your thinking was.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Luca Maestri </span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">The logic has not changed over the years. We look at our business plans, we look at what we want to accomplish from product perspective. We look at the capital needs that we have to run the business and to grow the business. And then we see that we\u2019re in this great position that we can return cash to shareholders.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We know Apple very well. We are very excited by the level of customer response that we\u2019ve got for our current portfolio. We\u2019re super confident about the pipeline of products and services that we have, and therefore, we believe that there is great value in our stock.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And that is the reason why, again this year, we\u2019re allocating the majority of the increase, which is the largest increase that we\u2019ve ever done, we\u2019re increasing the program by $70 billion. And the vast majority of that we\u2019re allocating to the share repurchase, because again, we believe there\u2019s great value in the stock.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We also know, and understand, that we have several investors that value income. And so that\u2019s important for us to increase the dividend. And as we\u2019ve said in the past, we plan to continue to increase the dividend every year. And as we\u2019ve said in the past, we will come back at about this time next year and give you another update to the program, because we will have better information, and we\u2019ll be able to be very thoughtful about the size and the mix and the pace of the program.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">From a funding standpoint, of course we have a very strong balance sheet. We do have some cash in the U.S. We will continue to generate cash in the U.S., but definitely a good portion of the program will be funded through debt. We will raise debt both in the U.S. and outside of the United States.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And you know, of course we\u2019ve got a very, very strong balance sheet. We\u2019ve got a very open dialog with the rating agencies. And so we feel we have a lot of room for us to fund the program. So from a balance sheet standpoint, we feel very, very comfortable with the program that we\u2019ve announced today.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Next we\u2019ll go to Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kulbinder Garcha</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">My first question is for Tim. Tim, on the point you made about the 20% of the [unintelligible] being on 6 or 6 plus, are we right in interpreting the comment that that\u2019s a substantially lower number than at this point in previous cycles? And that would, I guess, argue for just a longer period of growth as the [unintelligible] upgrades? And then also, linked to that, just by the points you\u2019re making on [unintelligible] iPhone users and [unintelligible] being higher, that number year on year, in the first six months, is really growing significantly year on year. Is that the right way to interpret that comment?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Cook </span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I missed the second part of your question totally. Can you get a little closer to your phone?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kulbinder Garcha </span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Oh, sorry, yes. My second part of my question is, in the first six months of the 6 plus, is the gross number of new users to Apple, whether it\u2019s new users or switches from Android, significantly growing year on year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Cook </span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I don\u2019t have the comparisons in front of me, about the answers to either one of your questions. My understanding of what you asked was is the 20% number that I\u2019d mentioned in the question from Gene, how does it compare year over year, is it a lot different? I don\u2019t know the answer to that off the top of my head.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">As I look at the number, my point from bringing it up is that there\u2019s a lot of people that haven\u2019t upgraded to a 6 and 6 plus. And so as I look at that, it screams that there\u2019s significant opportunity there. And that\u2019s before thinking about switchers and first time buyers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kulbinder Garcha </span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay great, and then Luca, just on the gross margin decline from the March quarter to June, I understand the currency point. I understand the iPhone\u2019s a little bit older. I guess of the iPhone and the watch impact, is the decline equally attributed to both those reasons, or is there something different going on?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Luca Maestri </span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Let me tell you, there are a number of reasons why our guidance for gross margins is lower than the actual for the second quarter. The first one is the loss of leverage, because of the sequential decline in revenue. We got the foreign exchange, we got as you said, a lower iPhone mix. And we got the Apple Watch. I think we\u2019ll leave it at that, and we\u2019re not gonna get into more specifics. But those are the four reasons that drive the sequential decline.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And next we\u2019ll go to Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Keith Bachman</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Tim, this is for you. You mentioned something in your past comment that you thought a lot of the iPhone sales were going into the middle class in China. And I\u2019m just wondering if you could elaborate on that and open it up more broadly speaking, to the emerging geographies. If you have demographics that you could talk about for your iPhone specifically, and where you think those phones are ending up. Because I think it does raise the question, as you look out over the next year or so, do you have the right price points for the demographic you\u2019re hitting?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Cook </span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Here\u2019s what I would share with you, Keith, is that if you look in the emerging markets, our revenues were up 58% year on year. And this accounted for just slightly less than 40% of the company\u2019s revenue. If you look at BRIC within the emerging markets, BRIC countries were up 64% year over year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And so as I look at that, without having market research data on the demographics that you\u2019re asking, it\u2019s clear to me that it has to be coming from the middle class, because the upper income earners, there\u2019s only so many of those. And you can\u2019t grow those kind of numbers without getting significantly into the middle class.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And so I think that\u2019s where we are. I hope we\u2019re also beyond the middle class, but I don\u2019t have the data to suggest that that\u2019s the case or not the case. But it\u2019s clear to me that the middle class statement has to be true.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Keith Bachman </span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">My follow up, Tim, I\u2019m gonna stay with you for a second, it sounds like HBO Now is a great opportunity today, and as you look out. If you could just speak more specifically, how we should be thinking about Apple as a conduit for something like HBO Now and other products. Is that a meaningful revenue opportunity without getting specific, and/or is it more about selling incremental devices, or is it about expanding the revenue pie as you look at opportunities like HBO Now?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Cook </span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">First of all, I think it\u2019s about giving the customer something they want and giving to them in Apples classic ease of use and in the product environments and the user interface that they\u2019re used to working in, in this case Apple TV.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And so I think HBO in particular has some incredibly great content. And so we\u2019re marrying their great content, our great product and ecosystem, and it\u2019s clear from looking at the early returns - you know, we\u2019ve only been at this for a couple of weeks or so - that there\u2019s a lot of traction in there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And so where could it go? I don\u2019t want to speculate, but you can speculate probably as good as I can about where that can go. I think we\u2019re on the early stages of just major, major changes in media that are going to be really great for consumers, and I think Apple could be a part of that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Thank you, Keith.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Nancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple CEO Tim Cook, and he'll be followed by CFO Luca Maestri, and after that we'll open the call to questions from analysts.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes and future business outlook. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast.

Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information which speak as of their respective dates.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Timothy D. Cook - Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon everyone, and thanks for joining us. It's been a busy and exciting quarter and I'm delighted to talk to you about the highlights. Today, we're proud to report record June quarter results with revenues of $49.6 billion and earnings of $10.7 billion. Our year-over-year growth rate in the fiscal third quarter accelerated over the first half of fiscal 2015. Revenues were up 33%, our fastest growth rate in over three years, and earnings per share were up 45%. We achieved these incredibly strong results despite reducing channel inventories across our product lines by over 1 million units and despite the challenging FX environment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Revenue exceeded the high end of our guidance by $1.6 billion as we topped our internal expectations for sales of iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple Watch. We had another stellar quarter for iPhone, establishing a new June quarter record. iPhone unit sales grew 35%, which is almost three times the rate of growth of the smartphone market overall and we gained share in all of our geographic segments. iPhone revenue grew even more strongly, up 59%. The strong iPhone results were broad-based in both developed and emerging markets and we experienced the highest switcher rate from Android that we've ever measured.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Most importantly, iPhone customer metrics are tremendous. ChangeWave's most recent survey of US customers found that iPhone has the highest customer satisfaction rate of any smartphone brand by a wide margin, and that among iPhone owners planning to purchase a new phone, 86% plan to purchase another iPhone. That compares to 50% repurchase intent for the next highest brand measured.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We also had a tremendous record quarter for Mac, continuing to defy the industry trend with unit growth of 9% in a market that IDC estimates contracted by 12%. Growth was fueled by great response to our new MacBook and we're working hard to catch up with customer demand.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We generated over $5 billion in services revenue, setting a new all-time record. Within services, the App Store produced its best quarter ever with revenue growing 24%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Our results from Greater China were outstanding with revenue growth of 112% and iPhone unit growth of 87%. This is particularly impressive given IDC's estimate of only 5% growth for the Greater China smartphone market. We also achieved our highest ever PC market share in the segment with Mac sales growing 33% over last year. And our ecosystem in China continues to grow at a very fast pace, with App Store revenue more than doubling in the quarter. Luca will go into more detail on our product and financial results in a moment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">A major highlight of the past quarter for all of us here at Apple was the launch of Apple Watch in April. As you know, we've been very excited to get this revolutionary product to customers. We started taking preorders in nine countries on April 10, and demand immediately exceeded supply by a wide margin. To prioritize those first orders and to deliver the best experience for our customers, we delayed the availability of Apple Watch in our own retail stores until mid June. We made huge progress with the production ramp across the quarter and near the end of the quarter expanded into six additional countries. And in just the past few days, we've been able to catch up with demand, enabling us to expand Apple Watch availability to a total of 19 countries currently with three more countries to be added at the end of this month.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">The feedback from Apple Watch customers is incredibly positive and we've been very happy with customer satisfaction and usage statistics. Market research from Wristly measured a 97% customer satisfaction rate for Apple Watch and we hear from people every day about the impact it's having on their health, their daily routines, and how they communicate. Our own market research shows that 94% of Apple Watch owners wear and use it regularly, if not every day.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Messaging and activity features are among the most popular and social networking apps including Twitter, WeChat and LINE are seeing the most usage among third party apps. We believe that the possibilities for Apple Watch are enormous and that's been reinforced in just the first few weeks since it became available to customers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">For example, doctors and researchers at leading hospitals in the US and Europe are already putting Apple Watch to work in improving patients' lives. Nebraska Medicine, the latest hospital to adopt Apple Watch, has rolled out new apps that facilitate communication between patients and doctors and provide quick access to important chart and dosage information.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Ochsner Health System of Louisiana is using Apple Watch with hypertension patients to gather important information like daily activity and blood pressure level, and leading cancer centers like London King's College Hospital are incorporating Apple Watch into trials for ongoing care and monitoring of cancer patients.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Great Apple Watch solutions go well beyond healthcare. Users are tracking their fitness, getting breaking news alerts, following their investments, connecting with friends, and living a healthier day. The user experience for Apple Pay and Siri is nothing short of incredible and customers are enjoying countless other features through the over 8,500 third-party apps available for Apple Watch.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">This is just the beginning of what this new platform can deliver. With Apple watchOS 2, developers now have the ability to build richer and more powerful native apps for Apple Watch, taking advantage of the heart rate sensor, the Digital Crown, accelerometer and more, ushering in a whole new class of apps designed specifically for the wrist.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">It's a rare and special privilege to launch a new platform with such promise and potential, and I know I speak for everyone at Apple when I say that we can't wait to see what our developers and customers do with it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We hosted a fantastic developers' conference in June with thousands of attendees from 70 countries coming together with Apple engineers to share in the excitement of our three operating systems, OS X, iOS, and watchOS. We've been working hard to make our products even more intelligent, more powerful and more meaningful in all aspects of our customers' lives, while adding new continuity features to make the experience across our devices more seamless than ever and preserving the security and privacy that our customers deserve. Public betas of OS X El Capitan and iOS 9 are available now and customer versions of all three updated OSs are on schedule and will be delivered in the fall.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We're very excited about our news app coming to iPhone and iPad with iOS 9. We believe it will be the best news reading experience on any mobile device, combining a beautiful magazine layout with real-time customized digital media content. News will follow over a million topics and pull relevant stories based on the user's specific interests without compromising their privacy. We've already signed 25 leading publishers, representing more than 75 of the world's most influential news, sports, business and magazine titles, including CNN, the New York Times, the Financial Times, ESPN, Bloomberg Business, Cond\u00e9 Nast, Hearst, Reuters, Time, Inc. and The Daily Telegraph.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">The September quarter is off to an exciting start. We're thrilled by the response to Apple Music, which launched in over 100 countries on June 30. Apple Music is a single immersive app that combines the best ways to enjoy music all in one place. It's an incredible streaming music service, a pioneering worldwide live radio station broadcasting 24 hours a day, and a great place for music fans to connect with their favorite artist. Customers and reviewers love the human curation features of Apple Music and the way it's helping people discover new music.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Millions and millions of customers are already experiencing the new service using the three-month trial period, and the numbers are growing substantially every day. Over 15,000 artists have signed up to post on Connect, where we are already seeing great original content, including a world premiere video by Drake. Millions of listeners around the world are tuning in to Beats 1, the first of its kind worldwide radio station featuring some of the most talented and passionate music lovers on the planet. This all adds up to a renewed sense of excitement around music, which we love and expect to continue as Apple Music gets traction with customers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Last week we launched Apple Pay in the UK, bringing customers our easy, secure and private way to pay. On day one, we had an incredible roster of over 250,000 locations and major credit and debit cards from many of the UK's most established banks supporting Apple Pay. Customers are using Apple Pay to ride the London Underground as well as the over ground systems of Transport for London and we hope this will be a model for other public transportation systems around the world.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In the US, we've seen fantastic support from merchants of all sizes. We are excited to see this momentum continue with the new Square reader coming this fall. It will bring Apple Pay to even more neighborhood businesses where you pay every day, from your corner coffee shop to your local farmer's market, bolstering the 80,000 small- and medium-size businesses we're already adding every month. American Express will add Apple Pay support for its robust portfolio of corporate cards next month, offering businesses and their employees a new way to make easy and secure payments. And as we head into the school year, 700 universities and colleges across the US will accept Apple Pay such as Auburn University, the University of California Irvine, Colorado State University, the University of Kentucky and the University of Oklahoma, among many others. We're on track for Apple Pay acceptance at over 1.5 million US locations by the end of 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">I'd like to thank our customers, developers, business partners and employees for another record breaking quarter. We're very hard at work on our exciting pipeline of new hardware, software and services, and we're continuing to expand our global reach into new markets. And we're passionately committed to leaving the world better than we found it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">With that, I'll turn the call over to Luca.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Luca Maestri - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. As we have done for the first half of our fiscal 2015, we are reporting another record quarter today. Revenue for the June quarter was $49.6 billion, an increase of $12.2 billion or 33% year over year. Our growth was driven by the tremendous performance of iPhone, the introduction of Apple Watch and the continued strength of Mac and App Store sales. We achieved these great results in the context of a very challenging foreign exchange environment around the world and a reduction in channel inventory of over 1 million units across our product lines, which makes our growth performance even more remarkable.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As Tim mentioned, our results were especially impressive in Greater China, where revenue more than doubled year over year to over $13 billion. Emerging markets overall grew 79% to almost $18 billion and represented 35% of our total company revenue. Company gross margin was 39.7%, better than our expectations, mainly due to strong iPhone sales. Operating margin was 28.4% of revenue and net income was $10.7 billion, a new June quarter record. Diluted earnings per share were $1.85, a 45% year-over-year increase and cash flow from operations was $15 billion, also a new third quarter record.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">For details by product I'll start with iPhone. We sold 47.5 million iPhones in the quarter, representing 35% year over year growth and demand for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus has continued to be terrific all around the world. iPhone sales more than doubled in Germany, Korea, Malaysia, and Vietnam. We're up over 85% in Greater China and in India, and increased more than 45% in several countries including Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Turkey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">The strong mix of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus led to an iPhone ASP of $660, an increase of $99 year over year, despite the significant negative foreign exchange impact I referred to earlier. We reduced iPhone channel inventory by about 600,000 units during the quarter, which left us at the low end of our target range of 5 to 7 weeks of channel inventory.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Next I'd like to talk about the Mac. We sold 4.8 million Macs, representing 9% year-over-year growth. As we have done for several years in a row, we continued to gain significant market share based on IDC's latest estimate of a 12% global PC market contraction. Mac growth was driven by portables and we are delighted with the very strong customer reception of our new MacBook. We ended the quarter slightly below our 4 to 5 week target range for Mac channel inventory.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to iPad. We sold 10.9 million compared to 13.3 million in the year-ago quarter. iPad sell-through was 11.2 million as we reduced channel inventory by about 300,000 units. This left us within our 5 to 7 week target range of iPad channel inventory. iPad customer metrics continue to be extremely positive. ChangeWave recently measured a 97% customer satisfaction rate for iPad Air 2 and among consumers planning to purchase a tablet within 90 days, over half plan to purchase an iPad. For corporate buyers, the purchase intent was even stronger at over 70%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We do not participate in the low end of the tablet market, but we are extremely successful where we do compete. NPD recently indicated that iPad has 76% share of the US market for tablets priced above $200. We're very excited about the advances in the iPad experience coming in iOS 9 in the fall, including the slide over and split view features for retail multitasking, picture-in-picture for FaceTime and video, and enhanced QuickType for composing text even faster.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We're also seeing great momentum in the enterprise market. For instance, riding on the success of iPad use by its pilots, United Airlines has not only renewed its iPad program with more than 10,000 iPad Air 2s, but has also made a strategic decision to provide iPhones to over 20,000 flight attendants. In the near future, United plans to introduce new apps to transform the customer experience and improve integration with flight operations.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We're also very happy with the progress of our IBM partnership. IBM released 13 new MobileFirst for iOS apps in the June quarter, including new apps in retail banking and healthcare, as well as new horizontal apps for HR and sales. There are now 35 apps in IBM's MobileFirst for iOS catalog that connect users to big data and analytics right on their iPads or iPhones. And we expect a total of 100 apps to be available by the end of 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Active customer engagements have also grown to over 500 and recent notable customer wins include Air Canada, National Grid in the UK and Banorte in Mexico. In April, Apple, IBM and Japan Post announced a joint initiative to deliver iPads with IBM developed apps and analytics to connect Japanese senior citizens with services, healthcare, community and family. Japan Post hopes to reach 4 million to 5 million Japanese customers with these solutions by 2020. Since announcing this initiative less than three months ago, we've already seen strong interest from other countries looking for innovative ways to support an aging population.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Importantly, we also continue to work closely with leading business software and solution providers to help businesses of all sizes transform work with iPad and iPhone. The number of these mobility partners has expanded rapidly to over 40. They're developing new and differentiated solutions on iOS across many industries, and attracting very significant customer interest.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Turning to services. We generated over $5 billion in revenue, a new all-time record, and an increase of 12% over last year thanks primarily to strong growth from apps. The revenue from the App Store increased 24% and the number of transacting customers grew 19%, also setting an all-time record. Services growth was particularly strong in China, where the App Store revenue more than doubled year over year. China based developers have created 250,000 apps for our China App Store and the response from our customers has been tremendous.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">The revenue from other products grew sharply, up 49% over last year. The contribution from Apple Watch accounted for well over 100% of the growth of the category, and more than offset the decline of iPod and accessory sales. As we've said in the past, we do not plan to disclose Apple Watch metrics because we don't intend to provide insight that could help our competitors.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Our retail and online stores had a very busy quarter, with customer visits up 49% year-over-year, driven especially by the very strong interest in Apple Watch. Thanks to our very popular Apple Store app, mobile traffic to our online stores during the quarter equaled desktop traffic for the first time ever. We opened three new stores, our second store in Brazil, our sixth store in Manhattan, and our twenty-second store in Greater China. That brought us to a global store count of 456, of which 190 are outside the United States, and we are on track to have 40 stores open in Greater China by the middle of next year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $202.8 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $9.3 billion. $181 billion of this cash, or 89% of the total, was offshore. In the June quarter, we issued a total of $10 billion of term debt, consisting of $8 billion US dollar denominated notes and \u00a5250 billion denominated notes as we continue to diversify our global debt investor base. This left us with $50 billion of term debt outstanding at the end of the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">During the quarter, we turned over $13 billion to our investors. We paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents and we spent $4 billion to repurchase 31.2 million Apple shares to open market transactions. We also launched a $6 billion accelerated share repurchase program in May and received an initial delivery of 38.3 million shares. The purchase period for the new ASR will end in or before November of 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We have continued to execute our capital return program at a fast pace and we now take an action on over $126 billion of our $200 billion program, including $90 billion in share repurchases. The weighted average price for all open market purchases and completed ASR programs to date is $86.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Now as we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $49 billion and $51 billion compared to $42.1 billion in the year-ago quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 38.5% and 39.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $5.850 billion and $5.950 billion. We expect OI&amp;E to be about $400 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 26.3%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Also today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.52 per share of common stock payable on August 15, 2015 to shareholders of record as of August 10, 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">With that, let's open the call to questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Nancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We ask that you limit yourself to one, one-part question and one follow-up. Operator, may we have the first question, please?</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p6\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">[Operation Instructions] First we will hear from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Yes, thanks. Good afternoon. While the year on year iPhone growth was very attractive, the sequential unit decline in the June quarter was worse than the past two years. Why do you think that was, and in particular, why drain channel inventory when iPhone 6 is selling so well? And then I have a follow-up.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy D. Cook - Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Katy, it's Tim. As Luca mentioned, the channel inventory did go down by 600,000. We sold more units than we thought we would and so that was a part of that. The other part of it is that we always run with just the amount of inventory that we think we need. And so to the degree that sales are distributed in the countries with disproportionally with shorter supply chains, or the standard deviation demand is less, we would always choose to have less.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">And so in this particular quarter, we were able to end basically right at the bottom end of our range and we view that as a good thing, not a bad thing. Obviously the revenues could have been much higher if we would have expanded the channel, but if you don't need to do that, that's not how we think about the business. We run the business for the long term, not the 90-day clock.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">In terms of what's going on with iPhone, the 35% growth is almost three times the market. And if you look at it at a little narrower regional level, Western Europe grew 30% versus a market of 7%, so four times market. Japan grew over five times market. We doubled in Korea versus a market that was shrinking. And India we grew at 93% and this is on top of the Greater China numbers that we've already covered that grew 87% during the quarter against a market of 5%. And so we did exceptionally well I think in any way that you look at it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">In terms of the percentage of customers that have upgraded to a 6 and 6 Plus versus that have not upgraded, it's 73%, or meaning that 27% of the installed base of customers prior to the launch of 6 and 6 Plus have now upgraded. And so we view that as a very bullish sign on the future, that there's a lot of headroom left for upgraders. We also are incredibly happy to see the highest Android switcher rate that we've observed. And so from our point of view, the iPhone is doing outstanding.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So Tim, just to extend that conversation to the longer term, as I'm sure you're aware, you're lapping some pretty significant comps as it relates to the upgrades that you're talking about as well as significant growth in China. What is the framework that you use to convince yourselves that iPhone units can continue to grow over the longer term?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy D. Cook - Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Well you know, Katy, we purposely just give guidance for the current quarter and we've done that. And obviously the kind of numbers that we have indicated growth in the revenue means that iPhone would have another stellar quarter. And so we're very confident that this quarter is going to be great. How the future looks, we'll take it one quarter at a time. But as I back up from it and look at it more from a macro point of view, the things that makes me very bullish is the 27% number I just quoted, the fact that we are seeing the highest Android switcher rate, the customer satisfaction that we have on the iPhone versus the competition. It's a huge margin. The loyalty rate that we have versus competition, an enormous gap there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">I also look at the first time iPhone buyers and we're still seeing very, very large numbers in the countries that you would want to see those in, like China and Russia and Brazil and so forth. I also see a market that over a five-year horizon, if you look at the IDC numbers, is projected to grow from 1.3 million in 2014 to over 1.9 billion \u2013 this is billion, rather, billion in 2019. And so it's an incredible market. I think everybody's going to own a smartphone, and I think we've proven that we can compete for a fair number of those, as you can see from our results.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Great. Thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Nancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Thank you, Katy. Could we have the next question, please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">That will come from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">William C. Shope - Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay, great. Thank you. Could you walk us through the key factors behind your gross margin range for the September quarter and in particular how we should think about the sequential ForEx impact this quarter and the impact of a potential product transition cost?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Luca Maestri - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Definitely. This is Luca. So we got into 38.5% to 39.5%, and so just keep in mind last year in Q4, our gross margin declined by 140 basis points sequentially. So this year we're expecting a sequential decline of 220 basis points. I would point to three main factors for the decline. First of all, to your point around foreign exchange, it continues to be a challenging environment given the strengthening of the US dollar. In our case, the impact on margin after the hedges is going to be about 30 basis points for Q4. Also, I want to point to a different mix, which is typical of our seasonality as we enter the back-to-school season during Q4. And thirdly, the transition cost that you've mentioned as we prepare for a busy fall. And so those are the three factors that will have an impact on gross margin sequentially. I would point that in general costs continue to be, particularly commodity costs continue to be favorable and so there would be a partial offset to the factors that I mentioned.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">William C. Shope - Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay, thanks. And then could you give us a bit more color on the mix dynamics for the iPhone in the June quarter and how this compares to prior generations and your expectations? Obviously there continues to be an upward bias helping the ASPs as you mentioned, but could you give us a bit more detail on what exactly you're seeing here? Particularly I think it's interesting in the context of a continued tilt towards the emerging regions obviously.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Luca Maestri - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yeah, so as we mentioned, the ASP for iPhone was up $99, 18% increase year-over-year and this is really driven by the mix, by the fact that we've added iPhone 6 Plus to a new price point and in general, iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are doing extremely well as a percentage of the portfolio. And keep in mind that this $99 was partially offset by $24 of unfavorable foreign exchange. So the number would have been even better. So yes, clearly 6 and 6 Plus. And I think we talked about it in prior calls, the 6 Plus is doing particularly well in the markets that you would expect, Greater China, other Asian markets. Those are markets where our growth rates are particularly strong and the 6 Plus, because of the screen size, is doing extremely well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">William C. Shope - Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">All right. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Nancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thanks, Bill. Could we have the next question, please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">That will come from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eugene C. Munster - Piper Jaffray &amp; Co (Broker)</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hi, good afternoon. Luca, you talked a little bit about gross margins in the previous question. But could you talk about how we should think about the trends in the gross margin? In other words is, should the margin trends that we've seen in other cycles continue into next year? And then a follow-up or another question for Tim here, is that the Watch has been under a lot of interest from investors and some may have wanted a little bit more. You outlined some of the opportunities and some of the progress you've had. But any thoughts that you have for investors who may say that the category is just not taking off as fast as they would have hoped?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Luca Maestri - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay Gene, let me start with gross margin. As Tim said before, obviously we guide to the current quarter. You know, as we look at it at a macro level. I think there are, you know every cycle is different for a variety of reasons. There are also things that are not necessarily within our control. So for example, currency markets can be very different one year to the next. We know that the next year is going to represent an additional challenge given where the dollar has moved. Commodity markets may be very different from one year to the other.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">There are things that remain relatively similar as we launch new products. For example, we innovate the products. We want to make them better all the time, and that typically requires additional cost and so the cost structures of our products, new products, tend to be higher than the products that they replace. Having said that, as you know we've got a very, very good track record to reduce those cost factors over the lifecycle of the products. I think this should give you a bit of color. Of course maybe the one thing that I want to point out again as we get into the following year, is that of course currency will be an issue.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eugene C. Munster - Piper Jaffray &amp; Co (Broker)</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy D. Cook - Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yeah Gene, this is Tim. Let me talk about the Watch some. As you know, we made a decision back in September, quite several months ago not to disclose the shipments on the Watch and that was not a matter of not being transparent, it was a matter of not giving our competition insight that's a product that we've worked really hard on. However, let me give you some color so to avoid reaching sort of a wrong conclusion. If you look at the other products category and look at the revenue in this category, it would not be an accurate thing to just look at the sequential change or the year over year change and assume that were the total Watch revenue because the aggregate balance of that category, both sequentially and year over year, is shrinking. Obviously iPod is a part of that, but there are other things in there, accessories and so forth, that are shrinking.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Secondly to provide a bit more color, sales of the Watch did exceed our expectations and they did so despite supply still trailing demand at the end of the quarter. And to give you a little additional insight, through the end of the quarter, in fact the Apple Watch sell-through was higher than the comparable launch periods of the original iPhone or the original iPad. And we were able to do that with having only 680 points of sale. And as you probably know, as I had reviewed earlier, the online sales were so great at the beginning, we were not able to feed inventory to our stores until mid-June. And so those points of sale pretty much, the overwhelming majority of the low numbers of sales were not there until the last two weeks of the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And so as I look at all of these things, we feel really great about how we did. Now our objective for the quarter wasn't primarily sales. Beyond the very good news on sales, we're more excited about how the product is positioned for the long term because we're starting a new category. And as I back up and look at this, we have 8,500 apps. We've already announced the next operating system, watchOS 2. It will bring native apps which are going to be killer to the Watch. Even though the store layout was delayed, we've learned a lot about the buying experience. Based on that experience, we're now planning to expand our channel before the holiday because we're convinced that the Watch is going to be one of the top gifts of the holiday season.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Now most importantly of all of this is that customer sat is off the charts because we've constantly seen if you can get the customer sat off the charts you can wind up doing fairly well over time. We've also learned a lot about managing quite an assortment and so forth. And so I sort of back up and look at this and I feel fantastic about what the team has done and delivered and I know I never go anywhere without the Watch and it's not because I'm the CEO of Apple. I'm that attached to it and I get lots of notes from a lot of people that feel the same way. And so that's how I look at the Watch.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Nancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thanks, Gene. Could we have the next question, please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">From Bernstein we'll hear from Toni Sacconaghi.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Antonio M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yes, thank you. Luca, I think in your prepared remarks you talked a little bit about your market share of iPad in the US above $200 being 78%. And I'm wondering if you think about the iPhone and your market share in the premium category, how do you think about it? So I've seen market data that says 60% market share for phones above $300 or you have actually 90% market share for phones above $600. And I'm wondering if, Tim or Luca, you could maybe talk about how you think about your market share, where you play given that your ASP is comfortably above $600? What do you think your market share is above $500 or $600 in smartphones? And how do we think about that, that market share going forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy D. Cook - Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Toni, it's Tim. We look at it a bit differently than you do. We look at it as our job is to grow our products regardless of the price, which means that we need to convince in some cases people to move from one price band to the other. And that we think if we do a great job with the product that people will be willing to spend more because they get so much more out of it. And I think you can look at the results on the iPhone and see that in action. I mean, we grew 87% in China. We grew 90%-plus in India. Emerging markets are growing 65%. These numbers are unbelievable and they're done in an environment where it's not the best of conditions. So that's how we look at. We don't do the MBA analysis of there's only X people buying in a price band and therefore we can only get X minus Y percent. That's not the way we've ever looked at it. If we did, we wouldn't be shipping any products.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Antonio M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Tim, I'm asking in part because you talked about the highest ever Android switcher. So I'm wondering if indeed your goal of expanding the category is happening or whether you are taking share and how do you measure the relative contribution of each of those in your success. So is the strength and the dramatically above market growth because you're taking share in that high-end category and how far along are you there? Or can you point to proof points that you've actually expanded the size of the market for products of your price point?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy D. Cook - Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Oh, I think there's no doubt if you look at it we are expanding the market size in those areas. It's also true that there's some people that are switching from comparable price points to the iPhone, and that's great too. But I think the answer is that both of those things are happening and it's key that we do both, not just one.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Antonio M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. And then if I could just ask you to comment on how you think about replacement cycles with the current iPhone 6 cycle. So when you look at replacement cycles over the last three quarters, are they similar to what you saw one and two years ago when you think about replacement? And one of the things that also sort of struck me was I think you cited market research having repurchase intention of 86% versus your competitors at 50%. Quite frankly, the 86% sounds low to me. Is that actually consistent with what you see in the marketplace, about 86% of iPhone buyers ultimately buy another iPhone? So perhaps we can think about replacement cycle.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy D. Cook - Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Antonio M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And how that's changed and the percentage number and how that jives with reality?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy D. Cook - Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">The 86% also seems low to me but I was quoting a third-party source and not our own data. Our own data would look better than that. But the numbers are only comparable if I quote the third-party source for both and so that's what I'm doing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">On the upgrade cycle and what we're seeing, it's not remarkably different. However, there's a number of plans that people began signing up for in the last year that could change it. These are upgrade any time kind of plans. They may be one year leases that could actually help the upgrade rate. And I think it'll be interesting to see how that plays out over the next horizon. But generally speaking, I see positive vectors there, not negative, in the aggregate.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Nancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Thank you, Toni. Can we have the next question, please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We'll go to Jim Suva with Citi.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James D. Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Thank you very much. As you look at many of your products have been absolutely fantastic and at different phases in their life, they've seen tremendous high growth, whether it's iPad, iPhone, iPod, and iPhone looks like it's facing some very challenging comps here in the next few quarters. Does this make you shift even more strategic focus into broadening the reliance on a couple products such as you mentioned Apple Radio. There's a lot more content on the Apple Watch and apps and then also Apple Pay. Are you increasingly focusing on hiring and kind of non hardware things (45:32)? Or are these kind of more peripheral activities and still the focus is kind of right now on the phone?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy D. Cook - Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Jim, it's Tim. We think the phone has a lot of legs to it. I mean, many, many, many years. There's tons of innovation left at the phone. I think we're in the early innings of it, not in the late innings, and I think the market rate of growth over the long haul will also be impressive. And so there will be multiple winners here. And so that's how I see it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">In terms of the other things that we're doing, we have some great capability and great teams in Apple. And so we can do more than one thing, and so we have other things that we're working on as well. But at the aggregate level, we still remain very focused because if you look at our size versus the number of projects we have going, it's much smaller compared to most. But that's how we do things and that's how we get the level of quality that we want out of each one of those.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And so the other things that you named, whether it be Apple Music or Apple Pay, both of these are very important to us. And things that you didn't mention, the Mac continues to perform very well. I am still bullish on iPad. We've gotten with iOS 9, there's some incredible productivity enhancements coming in with split view and slide over and picture-in-picture. These things are incredible features. The enterprise business is clearly picking up and more and more companies are either contracting for or writing apps themselves. I think and I believe that the iPad consumer upgrade cycle will eventually occur because as we look at the usage statistics on iPad, it remains unbelievably great. I mean, the next closest usage of the next competitor, we're six times greater.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And so these are extraordinary numbers. It's not like people have forgotten iPad or anything. It's a fantastic product. So I see a lot of runway. And as I look geographically, where we've been doing really good in the emerging markets, our share is still not high in any of them, and so there's a lot of headroom there as well, as there is in most developed markets as well. And so I look around, I see opportunity left and right. And that's what we're focused on.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James D. Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Great. Thank you so much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Nancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thanks, Jim. Could we have the next question please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">We'll hear from Steve Milunovich with UBS.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thank you. Tim, there's some concern about what's going on in China with the stock market and economically. How do you think that plays out for Apple? On one hand you've got more stores, broader distribution, the 4G infrastructure is playing out. On the other hand, the economy might be weakening. Is a phone a discretionary purchase or not? How do you think about going forward in China?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy D. Cook - Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yeah, it's a very good question, and we remain extremely bullish on China and we're continuing to invest. Nothing that's happened has changed our fundamental view that China will be Apple's largest market at some point in the future. It's true, as you point out, that the equity markets have recently been volatile. This could create some speed bumps in the near term. But to put it in context, which I think is important, despite that volatility in the Chinese market, they're still up 90% over the last year, and they're up 20% year-to-date, and so these kind of numbers are numbers I think all of us would love.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Also, the stock market participation among Chinese household is fairly narrow. And the stock ownership is very concentrated in a few people who put what appears to be a smaller portion of their wealth in the market than we might. And so I think generally this has been, at least as we see it, maybe it's not true for other businesses, that this worry is probably overstated. And so we're not changing anything. We have the pedal to the metal on getting to 40 stores mid next year. As we had talked about before, we're continuing to expand the indirect channel as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">As you point out, and I think this is a major point that many people miss, the LTE penetration in China is only at 12%. And China doesn't possess the level of fiber that some other countries do, and so in order to get the great video performance, et cetera, raising that penetration is really great. I think that really plays to an incredible smartphone future there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Also, and I can't underestimate \u2013 I can't overstate this. The rise of the middle class there is continuing, and it is transforming China. McKinsey, I saw a recent study from McKinsey that's projecting the upper middle class to grow from 14% to 54% of households over the ten-year period from 2012 to 2022. So we're within that period at this moment, and you can see for all of us that travel there so much, with every trip you can see this occurring. And so I think we would be foolish to change our plans. I think China is a fantastic geography with an incredible unprecedented level of opportunity there. And we're going to be there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I also wanted to ask, can you give us any more detail on the switching rate, how much is it up? And I noticed in your advertising there's the shift to the, if it's not an iPhone, it's not an iPhone. And I assume that while you're not as involved as Jobs was, you're approving these ads. So it seems like you're really focused on market share gain right now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy D. Cook - Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yeah, I'm very familiar with the ads. In certain geographies, the way that we win is to get switchers. In other geographies, the way that we win is to get people to buy their first smartphone. In other geographies, the way that we win is to get people to upgrade from their current iPhone. And all of those are very important for us. In many geographies, it's two of those or in some geographies it's all three of those. And so all of those are important. We are very focused on growing iPhone around the world, not just in one geography and getting our message out there through ads is one way to do that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Nancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Thank you, Steve. Could we have the next question, please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And that'll come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Thank you very much. I wanted to talk about FX but not necessarily from a direct impact. But what are you seeing in terms of demand as you've raised prices in various geographies and how are you thinking about it as you go into sort of the next iPhone cycle in terms of having to sort of normalize the pricing for what some of the currencies have done over the past year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Luca Maestri - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes, Shannon. So obviously FX has been a significant hit in many ways, of course. I mean it reduces our growth rate. We would be 800 basis points higher this quarter from the 33% that we've reported if it wasn't for the movement in currencies around the world. And really when you look around the world, it's really if you exclude China, essentially every single currency has weakened against the dollar. We are pretty careful and thoughtful about where we increase prices and when and by how much during mid-cycle because it's not something that we particularly like to do. We've had circumstances around the world this year where frankly we didn't have many options because the currency movement was so large and so we've had to reprice.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I have to say that it's been remarkable. Look, in the long run a strong US dollar is not a positive for our international business. It's normal to see a drop in demand when prices go up. That goes without saying. It has been remarkable so far to see that we did take prices in a few markets. But really remarkable to see how resilient iPhone sales have been, because we have increased, in spite of these price increases, we've increased sales and we've increased market share in all our geographies around the world, without exception.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Great. And then can you talk a bit about linearity during the quarter on a geographic basis? Somewhat going back to the China question, I mean did you see it slow down toward the end of the quarter? Or was it solid through it? And just any other color you can give geographically with Europe and some of the other macro events that are going on.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy D. Cook - Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yeah, Shannon, it's Tim. Maybe the best way to talk about this is sort of at the product level. On the Watch, our June sales were higher than April or May. I realize that's very different than what some of the, is being written, but the June sales were the highest. And so the Watch had a more of a back-ended kind of a skewing. The phone itself followed what I would call a normal seasonal kind of pattern. And if you look at the \u2013 it sounds like you're honing in on the Greater China results themselves. There is no obvious impact from the last quarter in the Greater China numbers. And obviously with the aggregate or the consolidated number being 112%, it's hard to find a lot of bad things in the numbers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Nancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Thank you, Shannon.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Nancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks as a podcast on the iTunes store, as a webcast on apple.com/investor, and via telephone.

Speaking first is Apple CEO Tim Cook, and he'll be followed by CFO Luca Maestri, after that we'll open the call to questions from analysts.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes and future business outlook.

Good afternoon everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, we are reporting a very strong finish to a record breaking year and I\u2019d like to reflect on some of the highlights.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We completed our fiscal year in September, and we are proud to report revenue of $234 billion, an increase of 28% and $51 billion over 2014. This is our largest absolute revenue growth ever. To put that into some context, our growth in one year was greater than the full year revenue of almost 90% of the companies in the Fortune 500. We made huge inroads into emerging markets generating over $79 billion in revenue and growing 63% despite very strong headwinds from foreign exchange rates.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">These results are made possible by Apple\u2019s commitment to innovation and creating the best products on earth. In the past 12 months around the world we\u2019ve sold over 300 million devices including 231 million iPhones, 55 million iPads and 21 million Macs setting new unit records and increasing our global market share for both iPhone and Mac.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We crossed 100 billion cumulative downloads from the App Store and we added powerful new services to our ecosystem, including Apple Pay in the United States, in the United Kingdom, Apple Music in over a 100 countries, and Apple News in the U.S.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We also entered an entirely new category with Apple Watch and we are in the very early innings of this promising new part of our business. We generated over $53 billion dollars in net income and grew earnings per share by 43%. We returned almost $50 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while continuing to invest confidently in research and development, marketing and distribution, our retail and online stores, our supply chain and our infrastructure.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We also completed 15 acquisitions to enhance and accelerate our roadmap for products and services. We accomplished all of these things while intensifying our efforts to protect the environment to promote equality and human rights and to ensure the security and privacy we know our customers deserve.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We are ending the year on a high note with a record breaking September quarter including sales of 48 million iPhones beating our expectations and up 22% year-over-year. Momentum for iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus remained very strong across the quarter and we established a new launch record for iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus near the end of the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We are seeing strong interest around the world and we\u2019ve been getting great feedback from customers who love the iPhone\u2019s new features including 3D touch, live photos, the new iSight camera, and the powerful new A-9 processor in the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We exited the quarter with demand for our new iPhones exceeding supply but we\u2019ve made good progress with our manufacturing ramp in the initial weeks of October. We sold an all time record 5.7 million Macs continuing to defy the negative trend in the global personal computer market which IDC estimates contracted by 11%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">The App Store set new all-time quarterly records for both the number of transacting customers and overall revenue. The strong performance of the App Store helped fuel $5.1 billion in services revenue also an all-time record.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Sales of Apple Watch were also up sequentially and were ahead of our expectations. This quarter we introduced beautiful new Apple Watch cases and bands including new Gold and Rose Gold aluminum Apple Watch Sport models. We released Watch OS 2 in September paving the way for a whole new class of native apps that are faster and can take advantage of the hardware capabilities of Apple Watch such as the microphone, speaker and the heart rate sensor.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Today, there are over 13,000 apps in the Watch App Store including over 1300 native apps such as Facebook messenger, MLB At Bat and Runkeeper and the number is growing rapidly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Apple Watch has already had a tremendous effect on customers\u2019 health and fitness and the stories we\u2019re hearing about its impact are truly inspirational. I personally heard from people who credit Apple Watch with saving their lives and customers are finding new applications all the time in their day to day activities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Revenue in Greater China nearly doubled year-over-year and we continue to focus and invest heavily there. I just returned from a four day visit to Hangzhou and Beijing where we announced major new initiatives to provide renewable energy for our supply chain. I also visited our retail stores in China which are among the busiest in the world.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">On Saturday we opened a new store, our 25th in Greater China to a very enthusiastic crowd and we are on track to achieve our goal of 40 stores by the middle of next year. Yesterday, we started taking orders for the all new Apple TV and it was a huge first day for this exciting new product. We want to provide the same innovation in the living room that we delivered in our iOS devices. People are already watching more TV through apps today and we think apps represent the future of TV. We\u2019ve built a new foundation around this vision with a new operating system called tvOS innovative ways to connect with your screen and a smart use of Siri to search for what to watch.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Next month, we\u2019ll begin shipping iPad Pro, the most powerful iPad we\u2019ve ever made. iPad Pro will enable a new generation of apps for entertainment and productivity, design and illustration, engineering and medical and much more, and with the Apple Pencil and Smart keyboards users can customize their experience making iPad Pro an even more powerful tool for everyone from students to artists, to business professionals.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">iOS 9 has hit the ground running on track to be downloaded by more users than any software release in Apple\u2019s history with 61% of active iOS devices already running at less than six weeks after its September the 16th release.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In late September, we also launched OS X El Capitan which has made the world most advanced desktop operating system more refined and powerful than ever before. Apple Music has set a completely new standard, redefining and combining the best ways to enjoy music in a single immersive app. Over 15 million individual and family accounts are experiencing Apple music including over 6.5 million paying customers. We are thrilled to bring Apple Music to China beginning this quarter along with iTunes, movies and iBooks and we are especially happy to offer such great new and diverse content to our large highly engaged and rapidly growing customer base in China.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We are also looking forward to bringing Apple Music to the new Apple TV beginning this week. Apple Pay is seeing double digit growth in transaction month after month and we continue to add major businesses including Starbucks which will roll out Apple Pay support to all its U.S. stores in 2016.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Apple Pay now supports merchant rewards programs as well and popular retailers that will be coming online in the next few weeks. We are thrilled to announce today that we are partnering with American Express to bring Apple Pay to eligible customers in key global markets so even more people can experience the easy, secure and private way to pay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Apple Pay will be available to eligible American Express customers in Australia, in Canada this year and is expected to expand to Spain, Singapore and Hong Kong in 2016. The reach of our ecosystem continues to grow and iOS is changing more and more aspects of our customer\u2019s lives in very meaningful ways from their health, to their homes, to their cars.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In Health, there are now more than 1,600 health kit enabled solutions that are helping us live a healthier day. In the home there are over 50 brands working on home kit enabled accessories that can be privately and securely controlled from your iPad and iPhone, and in the car more than 50 automobile models have been announced with CarPlay support which provides a smarter, safer and more fun way to use iPhone in the car. And we will continue to work to make the iOS experience even more meaningful across more touch points of our daily lives.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">The impact of research kit also continues to build. We recently announced new studies on autism, epilepsy and melanoma adding to the important studies already underway on conditions from asthma to diabetes to Parkinson\u2019s disease.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Our iOS news app is off to a great start. Nearly 40 million people are reading Apple news and we\u2019ve been getting very positive feedback from the publishers. We have now signed more than 70 publishers representing hundreds of titles and we\u2019re happy to announce that news just launched in the United Kingdom and Australia with partners such as the BBC, NewsCorp, The Telegraph, The Guardian, Financial Times, Daily Mail and the Australian Broadcasting Service.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">And finally, we are making great strides in the enterprise market, announcing a new strategic partnership with Cisco in September while furthering our progress with IBM in building our mobility partners program. We estimate that enterprise markets accounted for about $25 billion in annual Apple revenue in the last 12 months, up 40% over the prior year and they represent a major growth vector for the future.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">I\u2019d like to thank our talented and incredibly hardworking employees, our developers and our business partners around the world and of course our very loyal customers for making 2015 Apples\u2019 most successful year yet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Luca to go over the September quarter results in more detail.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"><strong>Luca Maestri</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. It\u2019s great to conclude our record fiscal 2015 with our strongest September quarter ever. Revenue for the quarter was $51.5 billion, an increase of $9.4 billion or 22% year over year. Our growth was driven by the tremendous performance of iPhone, the expanded availability of Apple Watch and all time high services revenue and Mac sales.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We achieved these outstanding results despite severe and persisting weakness in foreign exchange rates around the world that affected all our geographic segments and this makes our year-over-year growth rates even more remarkable.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In constant currency, our growth during the fourth quarter would have been 800 basis points higher. We once again reported very strong numbers in Greater China with revenue growing 99% year-over-year to $12.5 billion. Emerging markets performance was strong overall up 65% year-over-year and representing 31% of total company revenue for the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Company gross margin was 39.9%, up sequentially better than our expectations, mainly due to lower than expected costs. Operating margin was 28.4% of revenue and net income was $11.1 billion, a new September quarter record. Diluted earnings per share were $1.96, a 38% year-over-year increase and cash flow from operations was $13.5 billion, also a new fourth quarter record.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">For details by product I'll start with iPhone. We sold 48 million iPhones in the quarter, up 22% year over year with strong performance around the world throughout the quarter. Total iPhone sales were up 120% in Mainland China and grew over 35% in South Asia and increased by over 20% in several markets around the world including Germany and Italy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">iPhone ASP was $670, an increase of $67 year-over-year, thanks to more favorable mix and in spite of the very significant negative impact from foreign exchange that I referred to earlier.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We increased iPhone channel inventory by less than 2 million units in order to support our new product launch at the very end of September quarter. We exited the quarter with demand exceeding supply and channel inventory below our target range of 5 to 7 weeks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Next I'd like to talk about the Mac. We sold 5.7 million Macs, which is an all time quarterly record and represents 3% year-over-year growth. We extended our very long running trend of PC market share gains based on IDC's latest estimate of a 11% global market contraction. Mac growth was driven primarily by the great customer response to our new MacBook and sales of MacBook Pro also remained strong. We ended the quarter below our 4 to 5 week target range for Mac channel inventory.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to iPad. We sold 9.9 million compared to 12.3 million in the year-ago quarter. iPad sell-through was 10.4 million as we reduced channel inventory by about 500,000 units. We exited the quarter below our 5 to 7 week target range of iPad channel inventory.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">iPad customer metrics remain extremely positive. In August, ChangeWave measured a 97% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad Air 2 and among consumers planning to purchase a tablet within 90 days, 70% planned to purchase an iPad. Corporate buyers reported a 95% satisfaction rate for iPad and a 90 day purchase intent of 73%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In the segments of the tablet market where we compete, we continue to be very successful. Recent data from NPD indicates that iPad has 73% share of the U.S. market for tablets priced above $200. And the latest data published by IDC indicates that iPad has 74% share of the U.S. Commercial Tablet market.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As Tim mentioned our enterprise initiatives continue to expand. In September we announced a new strategic partnership with Cisco to optimize their networks for iOS devices with a goal of providing iOS mobile users with great performance advantage over other mobile platforms.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Also, during the September quarter, IBM released new mobile first for iOS apps in healthcare, financial services, travel and transportation and industrial sectors, including new apps leveraging iOS 9 and Watch OS 2.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">There are now 55 apps in the IBM mobile first for iOS catalogue and the list of projects signings is growing rapidly. Inside IBM, Macs are gaining tremendous traction. There are currently over 30,000 Macs deployed within the company with 1,900 more being added each week. IBM tells us that each Mac is saving $270 compared to a traditional PC, thanks to the much reduced support cost and better residual value. This is a terrific example of the kind of opportunity our devices offer to improve user experience and create value in the enterprise world.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Our mobility partner program also continues to grow with more than 25 new partners added in the September quarter bringing the total to over 65 and we are already seeing some great success stories with this program. We are also very excited about the potential of iPad Pro and the enterprise. For example, with the Bloomberg professional app, more than 325,000 financial professionals will be able to use iPad Pro to gain instant global access to finance and business news, market data and portfolio tracking and trading tools.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Turning to services. We generated $5.1 billion in revenue, a new all-time record, and an increase of 10% over last year mainly due to strong growth from apps. The revenue from the App Store increased 25% and the number of transacting customers grew 18%, also setting an all-time record. Services growth was particularly impressive in China, where Apple App Store revenue grew by 127% year-over-year. The momentum behind the App Store in China has been tremendous with huge interest from developers and customers alike. Our developer program in China has grown dramatically in the last year with over 1 million members in our program today.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Revenue from other products grew strongly up 61% over last year, thanks to the growing contribution from Apple Watch. We expanded Apple Watch distribution significantly over the course of the quarter and it was available at almost 5000 locations in 32 countries at quarter end.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Our retail and online stores had a very busy quarter. We opened 7 new stores, including our first store in Belgium. That brought us to a global store count of 463 of which 195 are in 15 countries outside the United States.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">In fiscal 2016, we expect to open or replace between 40 and 50 stores and we continue to place particular emphasis on Greater China where we plan to have 40 stores opened by the middle of next year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Customers have been very interested in the iPhone upgrade program offered in our U.S. retail stores. The iPhone upgrade program gives customer purchasing a connected device an easy convenient way to get a new phone every year with low monthly payments to a third party lender along with the security and protection of AppleCare Plus.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">After making 12 or more installment payments, customers can upgrade to a new iPhone. Let me also quickly discuss three accounting matters. First, relative to the iPhone upgrade program that I just mentioned, we will be reducing revenue at the time of sale for the cost associated with the program and deferring the portion of revenue related to AppleCare software upgrade rights and non software services for each iPhone sold.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Second, in September based on an analysis of market offerings we reduced the estimated selling price of future software upgrade rights and non software services that we defer for each iOS device and Mac sold, the reduction is between $5 and $10 per unit.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Third, also in September we lengthened the time period over which the deferred revenue associated to iPads will be recognized from two years to three years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $205.7 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $2.8 billion. $187 billion of this cash, or 91% of the total, was outside of the United States. In the September quarter, we issued a total of $5.8 billion of term debt, consisting of 1.25 billion British pound denominated notes, 2.25 billion Australian dollar denominated notes and 2 billion euro denominated notes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">This left us with $56 billion of term debt outstanding at the end of the quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We were very active in the market during the quarter and returned over $17 billion to our investors. We paid $3 billion in dividends and equivalents and we spent $14 billion to repurchase almost 122 million Apple shares through open market transactions. We also completed our fifth accelerated share repurchase program in July and retired an additional 10 million shares at settlement.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We have now completed over $143 billion of our $200 billion program including $104 billion in share repurchases of which $36 billion was repurchased in fiscal 2015 alone. Now, as we move ahead into December quarter, I like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $75.5 and $77.5 billion compared to $74.6 billion in the year ago quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 39% and 40%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.3 billion and $6.4 billion. We expect OI&amp;E to be about $400 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 26.2%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Also today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.52 per share of common stock payable on November 12, 2015 to shareholders of record as of November 09, 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">With that, let's open the call to questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Thank you, Luca. And we ask that you limit yourself to one, one-part question and one follow-up. May we have the first question, please?</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p6\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">[Operation Instructions] Your first question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Katy Huberty</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Yes, thanks, good afternoon. In light of December quarter revenue guidance, firmly low single digit revenue growth and what looks like increasingly tough comps heading into the March quarter, how do you get comfortable that Apple isn\u2019t on the verge of [ex] [ph] growth for the first time in a decade? And then I have a follow up.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Cook</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Katy, it\u2019s Tim. You have to consider the constant currency growth rates. And so if you do that, our guidance is actually 8% to 11% because we have about a 700 basis point FX headwind in Q1. And so the growth is actually quite good underneath that and that\u2019s obviously a problem with everyone struggling with it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Zooming out to the more macro question about growth, here\u2019s what I see currently. We believe that iPhone will grow in Q1 and we base that on what we are seeing from a switcher point of view, we recorded the highest rate on record for Android switches last quarter at 30%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We also look at the number of people that have upgraded, that were in the installed base prior to iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. And that number is in the low 30 percentages. So we feel like we have a very open field in front of us. Our performance in emerging markets although it\u2019s quite good and our revenue was good our market share is low and the LTE penetration in these markets is quite low.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Also, if I zoom out and look at China, as I have said before and just to make the point once again is we see an enormous change in China over the next several years. The latest study I have seen from Mackenzie indicates if you look back five years China\u2019s middle class had about 50 million people in it. If you look ahead five years, it will have ten times that number in it. And so -- and I feel like we are reasonably well positioned in China, I\u2019m sure we can do better, but I think we are doing fairly well there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">It\u2019s not the only market that we are working on obviously. I was really impressed last quarter with our progress in Vietnam and Indonesia and India among others. Also, from the currency point of view and the weak global economies, we don\u2019t overly focus on this. It\u2019s - my view is that it\u2019s sort of a transitional kind of thing and we invest for the long term, so we are continuing to invest for Apple\u2019s future.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">In addition to those Apple TV is off to a great start. Apple Watch is just getting going. The app store hit a new record again last quarter and the growth seems to be really great there. I\u2019m really happy with the early days of Apple Music and the people moving from the free trial to the music business. And finally, the enterprise business is not to be underestimated, I doubt very many people knew that we had $25 billion enterprise business that we quietly built in not too many years, but our penetration is low, but we have significant actions going on to really deepen that. So sort of everywhere I look I see significant opportunity. Long answer but I thought you might be interested.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Katy Huberty</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">No. I appreciate that. Just as a follow-up on growth, if you look at large services companies, Facebook, Amazon, Google, they're all growing over 20% and it's largely driven by activity of Apple users on iOS devices. Do you feel like there is more that Apple can do to participate in that services growth or you relegated to fundamentals that are tied to device upgrade cycles?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Cook</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Well, the App Store is growing over 20%, it grew 25% last quarter, and so we feel very good about that. That's become a sizeable business. I would also point out that some of these upgrade programs that are in the market, they sort of began to look more like a subscription business in terms of the way they operate. And so we think that in the aggregate that they may reduce upgrade cycles and also the iPhone that has been sold to someone else hits the price point that we're not hitting today largely which could help further fuel the services revenue which we did quite well on last quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Katy Huberty</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Cook</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Yep.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Nancy Paxton</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Thank you, Katy. May we have the next question, please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">From Piper Jaffray, we'll hear from Gene Munster.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gene Munster</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Good afternoon and congratulations. Tim, you just briefly touched on as reducing the time between upgrades, but how do you think about the iPhone upgrade cycle compressing over the next few years, obviously the impact from carrier\u2019s changes in the iPhone upgrade program. Can you talk a little bit about when that's going to be rolled out internationally? And then lastly, Luca you mentioned some of the accounting changes related to the iPhone upgrade program. Any sense in terms of what percentage of the Plus \u2013 the s upgrades were associated with the upgrade program? Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Cook</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Gene, in terms of the upgrade program it's early, but here's what we believe our current view is that we do think that the broader upgrade program, so I'm not just talking about our program that in retail, I mean, that is relatively small compared to our total iPhone sales of the company, but the broader thing obviously is that many of the carriers are offering these plans. And that, if you look at them in the aggregate, we think that it would have a positive impact in replacement cycles. We do like the fact that it creates a market for an iPhone at a different price point as well that is a better product than that customer maybe currently buying which would further help from an ecosystem point of view and that's not to be underestimated.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">It also seems like that from a rollout point of view there's a -- you will see these plans offered in a significant way in the United States already, but in fact these plans are being offered in some derivation in over dozen countries in the world. They're not as pervasive as they are in the U.S. but it seems like we\u2019re on the front end of fairly major trends in the industry.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Luca Maestri</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">From a financial perspective, Gene, the transaction on our iPhone upgrade program is a purchase, it\u2019s not a lease and so we recognize our revenue upfront, of course we deduct also upfront the cost associated with the program essentially to provide interest free financing and we need to estimate deferred value of the upgrade option for the customer, but as Tim said, it\u2019s a popular program in our U.S store, in the scheme of things, it\u2019s a small percentage of our worldwide iPhone sales and so we'll have really a negligible impact for example, on ASPs for the phone.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gene Munster</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And Tim, if we put it all together is it something that has more measurable impact on the business two, three quarters down the road, is that the right way to generally think about it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Cook</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Yes, we think about it as being \u2013 there were some clearly that were offered in the market prior to this cycle. But they became much more pervasive and much communicated, I think much wider with the September announcements. And so, I would sort of expect to begin seeing this somewhere around a year from now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gene Munster</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Nancy Paxton</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thank you, Gene. May we have the next question, please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Moving on, we'll hear from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Toni Sacconaghi</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yes. Thank you. Tim, I appreciated the color that you provided on the drivers of iPhone growth in Q1. I think the investor concern is that Q1 will benefit at least on a year over year basis from three extra weeks of availability in China. And it will also benefit from more of those initial launch days that only two of them were in the September quarter and the remainder will be in the December quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And so I guess the investor concern is December is a structurally advantaged quarter in the sense of benefiting from both of those tailwinds on a year-over-year basis. But if we look out beyond December, wouldn't that point to notably lower seasonal growth than the March quarter. And how do we think about the factors affecting unit growth beyond the December quarter? And then I have a follow-up, please.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Cook</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">We don't guide beyond December, as you know Toni. I do think that the sort of the macro things that I spoke about earlier, the upgrade programs, the Android Switcher rate, the iPhone momentum in the emerging markets and the LTE penetration in these markets these trends are not one quarter things. These are longer term things. The same \u2013 my same response applies and I think we'll do quite good in iPhone. I do believe we'll grow this quarter as we put in our guidance that when you start with a number in the low 30s in terms of the percentage of the installed base that\u2019s upgraded that had a phone pre the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, that number still likely to leave a lot of headroom beyond December.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So that's how I look at that. In terms of your first comment, you didn't asked me to comment on that, but just to be clear, our forecasting doesn't work like you articulated it. I recognize that people can have their own models and so forth, but just to make it clear that I'm not agreeing with your point.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Toni Sacconaghi</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. And then just on the follow-up, the reported gains from currency hedging in fiscal year 2015 were significant, several billion dollar contribution to the company. And again, this is not an Apple's specific issue, Luca as you pointed out several times, but how do we think about this notion of currency hedges effectively rolling off and being replaced with hedges that are likely have less of an impact. How do we think about that impact the P&amp;L on a go forward basis, perhaps starting with Q1, but then qualitatively or directionally over the course of the year? And what is some of kinds of things that you've undertaken or planning to undertake that could mitigate some of those concerns?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Luca Maestri</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yes. I think, Toni, it\u2019s a very good point, I mean, what's going to happen in practice is that we got this portfolio of hedge comp such that over time provides protection to our margins and to our results, but that protection diminishes as we go through the year and so we should expect that in over time during the course of fiscal 2016 that protection will come off assuming that the dollar stays at current levels. Keep in mind, there are some currencies around the world that where we cannot economically hedge and so those currencies are bit excluded from what we're talking about right now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I think my conclusion is that the guidance that we're providing for the first quarter that 39% to 40% it actually an incredible level of guidance given the foreign exchange headwinds that we're dealing with. How do we deal with that? We continue to hedge, so our program continues on an ongoing basis and we will continue to provide some level of protection to foreign exchange movement. In some cases we have realign prices particularly when we launch new products. We tend to do that in a number of countries where the foreign exchange moves have been particularly extreme, and so we tend to recover that through pricing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And then finally, of course we are putting in place a number of cost initiatives that would allow us to deal with the foreign exchange situation. So, overall we feel very strong guidance for the first quarter. And beyond the first quarter as you know we're not guiding and so we'll see over the course of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Toni Sacconaghi</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Nancy Paxton</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thanks, Toni. Could we have the next question, please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">We'll go to Shannon Cross with Cross Research.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Shannon Cross</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thank you very much. Tim, I wanted to go back to your commentary on the enterprise business, $25 billion I think you said, it was up 40% year-over-year. I know you have a relatively small sales force internally and obviously you utilizing the joint ventures, but as you noted you see that's an important driver of growth. So, how do you attack that market going forward? Will there be changes? Is there something that you need to shift or focus product in a little bit of different directions to make sure you can adequately attack it. Just in general how you're thinking about it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Cook</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">From a product point of view, we'd actually been continuing to change and improve IOS for some time. With every release they are more enterprise features and so, I would describe it as sort of continuation of that cadence perhaps with little more intensity. From a go to market point of view, we will be working with or are working with IBM. With Cisco. We're already working with 75 mobility partners that are principally in the U.S. but that's expanding quickly to international as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And so, many of these companies have -- in some cases very large sales forces, in many cases the reasonable seize sales force. And in addition to a direct sales force there is a huge worldwide indirect channel that many customers buy from and count on buying some services from. And so I do not envision Apple's having a large enterprise sales force will certainly make \u2013 we continue adding some people more on the engineering side, but I don't envision having a large direct sales force.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Shannon Cross</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay, great. Thank you. And can you give us some more color on China, 120% year-over-year growth in iPhones, but can you talk in general about what you're seeing in the marketplace and perhaps where you think you in terms of penetration from a smartphone standpoint especially with a China Mobile which has a substantial opportunity to grow given the LTE penetration?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Cook</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yes. If you look at China, we grew from an iPhone point of view, Greater China, we grew 87% the market grew for. If you take iPhone out of the market number, the certain market x iPhone actually contracted slightly. And so, we've been able to grow without the market growing. iPhone 6 was the number one selling smartphone in Mainland, China last quarter and iPhone 6 Plus was number three. And so, we did fairly well. The sort of the economic question which I know there's a bit lot of attention on, frankly, if I were to shut off my web and shut off the TV and just look how many customers are coming in our stores regardless to whether they're buying, how many people are coming online, and in addition looking at our sales trend,</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I wouldn't know if there was any economic issue at all in China. And so I don't know how unusual we are with that. I think that there's a misunderstanding probably particularly in the Western world about China's economy, which contributes to the confusion. That said, I don't think it\u2019s growing as fast as it was, but I also don't think that Apple's results are largely dependent on minor changes than growth. I think it\u2019s much more of contributing \u2013 I think other things contribute to that much more. That does say, you'll never had problem there, because the economy, I'm not saying, I'm dumb enough to think that. But I just think that the area that it's currently operating within, it's hard to tell the difference of the consumer level for us. I mean, you really can't tell the difference, if you look at sort of our daily and weekly numbers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So, we're very bullish on it, and I would point out that we're investing in China not for next or the quarter after, or the quarter after, we're investing for the decades ahead and as we look at it our own views is that China will be Apple's top market in the world. And that's not just for sales, that's also developer community is growing faster than any other country in the world. And so, the ecosystem there is very, very strong. I was very impressed with the number the developers I met last week and of course, the customers in stores are enthusiastically contagious.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Nancy Paxton</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Thank you, Shannon. Can we have next question, please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We'll go to Steve Milunovich with UBS</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steve Milunovich</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Thank you. Tim, I wanted to talk about the two sources of your iPhone demand selling to current customers and selling to new customers. In terms of selling to current customers you indicated about a third of the base is moved to the sixth line. As much as people talk about that been a huge upgrade cycle and what is the six has have incrementally, 33% not that a bigger number, I would have thought it would be bigger than that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Does this suggest that there is maybe more of a consistency to upgrading than the street perceives. And then on the other side in terms of new customers, just wanted clarity on the switcher number, are you saying that 30% of iPhone shipments in the quarter went to android switchers to IOS. And do you believe that you could actually have more new customers to Apple in fiscal 2016 than you had fiscal 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Cook</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">There's a lot there. Let me start with the Android Switcher. What this means is that for customers to purchase an iPhone last quarter and replace the smartphone that 30% of those switched from an android device. And so there would have been some switchers on top of that from other operating systems, but obviously android is the largest one by far. And so that's what that means, and that number is the largest that we've ever recorded since we began measuring it three or so years ago.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And so, it\u2019s a huge number, we're very, very proud of that number. In terms of 2016 versus 2015 new customers, it's hard to predict. I'm very happy with how we're doing. We're doing better than we've ever been doing. People -- I know there's a fixation on the upgrade rate. When I look at the upgrade rate, Steve, what I see is I feel good that it\u2019s a low number because that's low number means that there is 69% of the people that are out there prior to the iPhone 6 and 6 plus that haven't bother to upgrade this year. That's a large number.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And so, I'd see that is opportunity. Do I think it has anything, does to length to consistency? I think part of it is and I believe that the iPhone upgrade plans that are out there as I've mentioned before it seems to me on the future. We'll tell it\u2019s true or not, but it seems to me it\u2019s going to act as a catalyst to accelerate some of this upgrades. And I think that's not something that we're going to see this quarter or next quarter, but it seems like it\u2019s going to happen beginning a year for now or so.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">It have begins to be \u2013 you've seen the plan. They look more and active like a subscription than they do like a purchase. And that's great for the customer because many of them want to upgrade on a frequent basis and they can do this very, very simply. In terms of new, I don't know, whether we'll more new or not. I can tell you that that's always our objective. We want to add a lot more people to the ecosystem and certainly if you look in the emerging markets, even like, nobody is asking about iPad on the call. But if you look at iPad as just an example, in China, 68% of the people that purchased an iPad it was the first tablet they've owned and 40% of those have never owned any Apple product.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Just to go through one product with one set of number. I don't want to get through a bunch of numbers because it does contain the data than I don't want to share. But these are things that we're very focused on. And the first time buyer number is surprisingly strong. And keep in mind that we have a good history of bunch of people buy one Apple product, they have a great experience. They begin to look at other Apple products. And of course we makes they all work well together.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steve Milunovich</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Nancy Paxton</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thank you, Steve. Could we have next question, please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">From Goldman Sachs, we'll go to Simona Jankowski.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Simona Jankowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Hi. Thank you very much. Just is a follow-up to that last question and to put that in context, roughly what percent of the iPhone shipments come from shipments for the installed based versus from your user shipment?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Cook</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I don't know the answer of your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Simona Jankowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. And then just a follow-up, as Luca mentioned, you had to make some adjustments to the pricing in various regions given the currency move we've had. What had been the response in terms of demand, I guess both in terms of units and revenues in some of these regions like Japan or India, parts of Europe where the local prices has to go up?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Luca Maestri</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Simona, we've made a number of price changes during the course of fiscal 2015. What we've seen in a normal of these markets, we've seen that iPhone sales have been very resilient and that shown in our growth rates. Most recently we've adjusted some prices around the world for the launch of iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. We are very positive about the safest trends around the world. It\u2019s a bit early to tell, because the phones have out there just for four weeks, so its bit early to tell there. Obviously when we increase prices around the world, it's normal to see some impact on sales rates, but so far we were encouraged by the response.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Cook</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Let me go back to your question. And this is an exactly what you're asking that what your view, I think some color is. The reason I can't answer this is, we don't look at any aggregate, we actually look at the detailed because it's much more important for to us to look at, buy iPhone model by country, what percentage going to our first iPhone buyers. Somebody that's never owned an iPhone before. And so if you look at China as an example, it's over 50% of people that bought 6 and 6 Plus were buying their first iPhone.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">As you move down the line, that numbers goes up. And so a 5s generally speaking is higher in most countries. And so, that gives a feel for very important market and we cannot where the numbers are.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Simona Jankowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Great. Thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Nancy Paxton</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thank you, Simona. Can we have the next question, please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Next we'll go to Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Amit Daryanani</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thanks a lot. Good afternoon guys. Two questions from me as well. I guess, first could you talk about the gross margin dynamic as you go from September to December, the midpoint implies on 20 basis points. I think the last five years that's only happen once the gross margin is going down in fiscal Q1. Can you just talk about what the FX dynamic or what area the other headwinds that you think that implies gross margins being done in December?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Cook</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes. Let me give you puts and takes for margins for the December quarter. On the positive side, of course as you mentioned that we would have positive leverage from the higher seasonal volumes. Also what we've seen over the last several quarters is a commodity environment that has been quite favorable and we expect it to remain favorable during the December quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">On the other hand, of course we are launching a lot of new products. We\u2019ve launched some during September. We are launching some now and everything we launch new products, we make them better. We had features and new technology and these products when we launch and tend to have higher cost structures than the products what they replaced. We have a very good track record overtime to reduce those cost structures, but every time we introduce a new product that is a headwind at the beginning of the cycle for gross margin.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">While it\u2019s different from a year ago very significantly with the foreign exchange impact that we have mentioned before it remains a very significant headwind as I mentioned earlier to Tony I believe we are dealing with that to a combination of hedging, price realignments [ph] cost initiatives, but on a net basis foreign exchange we will clearly by a sequential headwind.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Amit Daryanani</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Got it. And then Tim when you talk about seeing iPhone growth in fiscal Q1, I\u2019m curious is that statement more reflective of iPhone units or iPhone revenues so that the ASPs could hardly get growth even if units are not there. And then would you expect to exit within the 5 to 7 week optimal inventory range in fiscal Q1?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Cook</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I don\u2019t know that we will exit. We make that call late in the quarter as we see what the demand is because we are actually trying to position the inventory for the following quarter instead of the current quarter. And it\u2019s very difficult to predict. What was your other question?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Amit Daryanani</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I was just curious to your statement on iPhone growth in fiscal Q1, is that a reflection of\u2026.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Cook</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Is it revenue? I was making a revenue statement but units are also, yes we expect units to be up as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Amit Daryanani</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Cook</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Nancy Paxton</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Thank you, Amit. Can we have the next question please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">From JPMorgan we\u2019ll go to Rod Hall.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Rod Hall</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask Tim maybe if you could comment on the mix between iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s. And whether the mix of demand is any different than what you say for instance that the iPhone 5, 5s point whether there is more say iPhone 6, I know you highlighted that the iPhone 6 is a number one phone in China for example and then I have a follow up?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Cook</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">The statement I made in China was about Q4 and the 6s was only available in China for two days last quarter. The iPhone 6s is the most popular iPhone that we currently sell. In terms of has there been a change. If you look at iPhone 6 today, and add iPhone 6 Plus and compare that to last year\u2019s 5s we are doing better, at that price point than we were previously.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Rod Hall</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay, thank you. And then there\u2019s follow up for what you were doing on the upgrade program. I am wondering if can you envision a time ever made in the U.S. or elsewhere where you would not have to come into an Apple store to activate it or to take advantage of the upgrade you might be able to do that somewhere else, do you start now what your\u2026.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Cook</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">That\u2019s a really good question. We actually solved that problem back in 2007. But then quickly had to change it in order to scale in a major way. And so that is something that we would always -- sort of always in our mind that one day from a customer experience point of view we would like to make things as easy as possible for the customer.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And to some degree you can already do that with buying online. But there are many different plans and search what the people buy, that they have to come in for several times we would love to have that automated and working with our partners, with service providers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Rod Hall</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Great. Thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Cook</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>A - Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Thank you, Rod.

Today's call is being recorded.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us. Before we begin, we want you to know that in addition to our press release and summary data schedule, we've published some supplemental material that we'll be referring to in our remarks today and you can find a link to this supplemental material on our Investor Relations' website, at apple.com/investor. And it's also included as an exhibit in the Form 8-K we filed with the SEC earlier today.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Speaking first today is Apple CEO, Tim Cook, and he will be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri and after that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes and future business outlook.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecasts.

Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information which speaks as of their respective dates.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thanks, Nancy, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you very much for joining us. Today, we're reporting Apple's strongest financial results ever. We generated all-time record quarterly revenue of $75.9 billion in the December quarter, in line with our expectations and up 2% over last year's blockbuster results.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">This is a huge accomplishment for our company, especially given the turbulent world around us. In constant currency, our growth rate would have been 8%. Our record revenue and continued strong operating performance also led to an all-time record quarterly net income of $18.4 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We sold 74.8 million iPhones in the December quarter, an all-time high. To put that volume into perspective, it's an average of over 34,000 iPhones an hour, 24 hours a day, seven days a week for 13 straight weeks. It's almost 50% more than our Q1 volume just two years ago and more than four times our volume five years ago.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">74.8 million iPhones is an incredible number and it speaks to both the immense popularity of iPhone and the phenomenal execution of our teams to deliver a massive number of devices in such a short period of time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Our results are particularly impressive, given the challenging global macroeconomic environment. We're seeing extreme conditions unlike anything we've experienced before just about everywhere we look.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Major markets, including Brazil, Russia, Japan, Canada, Southeast Asia, Australia, Turkey and the eurozone, have been impacted by slowing economic growth, falling commodity prices and weakening currencies.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Since the end of fiscal 2014, for instance, the euro and British pound are down double-digits, and major currencies such as the Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Mexican peso, and Turkish lira have declined 20% or more. The Brazilian real is down more than 40% and the Russian ruble has declined more than 50%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">66% of Apple's revenue is now generated outside the United States, so foreign currency fluctuations have a very meaningful impact on our results. Page one of our supplemental material illustrates this point.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">$100 of Apple's non-U.S. dollar revenue in Q4 of 2014 translated to only $85 last quarter due to the weakening currencies in our international markets. As you can see, the movement has been dramatic. Last quarter alone, the currency impact has been very large.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Page two of our supplemental material illustrates our Q1 revenue and growth rates expressed in constant currency. The 8% growth rate I spoke about earlier translates to $80.8 billion in constant currency revenue, which is $5 billion more than our reported revenue. For perspective, that difference is about the size of the annual revenue of a Fortune 500 company.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We know the conditions in China have been a source of concern for many investors. Last summer, while many companies were experiencing weakness in their China-based results, we were seeing just the opposite, with incredible momentum for iPhone, Mac and the App Store, in particular.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In the December quarter, despite the turbulent environment, we produced our best results ever in Greater China, with revenue growing 14% over last year, 47% sequentially, and 17% year-over-year in constant currency. These great results were fueled by our highest ever quarterly iPhone sales and record App Store performance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Notwithstanding these record results, we began to see some signs of economic softness in Greater China earlier this month, most notably in Hong Kong. Beyond the short-term volatility, we remain very confident about the long-term potential of the China market and the large opportunities ahead of us and we are maintaining our investment plans.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Despite the economic challenges all over the world, Apple remains incredibly strong. We have a very satisfied and loyal customer base. We saw a greater number of switchers from Android to iPhone than ever in Q1, and we are very optimistic about our business over the long-term.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Innovation has always been the reason behind our success and we remain committed to making the best products in the world and expanding the Apple experience to change our customer's lives in better and more meaningful ways.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We've invested through economic uncertainty in the past and we've always come out stronger on the other side. In fact, some of the most important breakthrough products in Apple's history were born as a result of investing through the downturn. We've also seen these times as opportunities to invest in new markets, just as we're doing now in areas such as India and other emerging markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Getting back to our record Q1 performance, let me give you some highlights of what we've accomplished since our last quarterly call together. We shipped the amazing new iPad Pro, which has been extremely well received by customers along with a new smart keyboard and revolutionary Apple Pencil.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We launched the all-new Apple TV with its own App Store, laying the foundation for the future of television. We had our best quarter by far for Apple TV sales and the number of apps developed for Apple TV is growing rapidly. Today there are over 3,600 apps delivering everything from games to entertainment to educational programming.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We expanded distribution of Apple Watch to almost 12,000 locations in 48 countries during the quarter. As we expected, we set a new quarterly record for Apple Watch sales, with especially strong sales in the month of December.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We released OS X El Capitan, refining the experience and improving performance for our Mac customers. We also updated the entire iMac family with stunning new retina displays and introduced a new line up of wireless accessories.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We launched Apple Pay in Canada and Australia with American Express and announced plans to bring this amazingly convenient, private, and secure mobile payment experience to China, Hong Kong, Spain and Singapore in the coming year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Consumers have spent billions of dollars with Apple Pay. In the second half of 2015, we saw a significant acceleration in usage, with a growth rate 10 times higher than in the first half of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">There are now over 5 million contactless payment ready locations in the countries where Apple Pay is live today and it's soon to be accepted at thousands of Exxon and Mobil branded stations across the U.S. via their Speedpass+ app.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Finally, we also shared the incredible Apple Music experience with even more listeners, with over 10 million paying subscribers less than four months since customers began paying for the service.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Our financial position has never been stronger. We had the mother of all balance sheets, with almost $216 billion in cash, which translates to nearly $39 per diluted share of Apple stock. We continue to invest confidently in our future and we also continue to return capital to our shareholders at a rapid pace.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Our investors have been asking for a while about the recurring nature of our business. Especially during a period of economic uncertainty, we believe it is important to appreciate that a significant portion of Apple's revenue recurs over time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">First and foremost, our customer satisfaction and retention rates are second to none and provide us with a long lasting foundation. For example, recent consumer surveys by 451 Research, formerly known as ChangeWave, measured an incredible 99% customer satisfaction rate for iPhone 6S and 6S Plus and an equally impressive 97% rate for the iPad Air 2. They also indicate that our iPhone loyalty rate is almost twice as strong as the next highest brand.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In addition, a growing portion of our revenue is directly driven by our existing install base. Because our customers are very satisfied and engaged, they spend a lot of time on their devices and purchase apps, content, and other services.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">They also are very likely to buy other Apple products or replace the one that they own. And because of the enduring value of the device, their replacing is likely higher to be given or sold to someone who will also love and use it often.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">So, as a result, our install base has been growing very fast and has recently reached a major milestone, crossing 1 billion active devices for the first time. This is an unbelievable asset for us. Because our install base has grown quickly, we have also seen an acceleration in the growth of our services business, another large and important source of recurring revenues.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Now that we have reached this milestone of 1 billion active devices, we felt this would be a great opportunity to share more information on what has become one of the largest service businesses in the world.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">So now, I'd like to turn the call to Luca, who will provide more insight into how our platform has grown, followed by details on our record quarterly results.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"><strong>Luca Maestri</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Each quarter, we report results for our Services category, which includes revenue from iTunes, the App Store, AppleCare, iCloud, Apple Pay, licensing, and some other items. Today, we would like to highlight the major drivers of growth in this category, which we have summarized on page three of our supplemental material.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">The vast majority of the services we provide to our customers, for instance, apps, movies and TV shows, are tied to our installed base of devices, rather than to current quarter sales.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">For some of these services, such as content, we recognize revenue based on transaction value. For some of the services, such as the App Store, we share a portion of the value of each transaction with the app developer and only recognize revenue on the portion that we keep.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">To fully comprehend the scale of the services that we are delivering to our installed base and how fast this business is growing, we look at purchases in addition to revenue. When we aggregate the purchase value of services tied to our installed base during fiscal 2015, it adds up to more than $31 billion. That's an increase of 23% over fiscal 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In the recent December quarter, purchases of installed base services reached $8.9 billion, which is a growth rate of 24% year-over-year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">The size and growth of these services tied to our installed base compare favorably to other services companies you're familiar with. Our installed base services are also quite profitable, with gross margins that, on a purchase value basis, are similar to our company average.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Also, we're very excited by the scale and growth of our active installed base, as we indicate on page four. We define an active device as one that has been engaged with our services within the past 90 days. Our active installed base has recently past 1 billion devices with year-over-year growth of more than 25%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Apple is in a unique position of strength. We have world class scales in hardware, software and services all under one roof, which lets us innovate in ways that other companies can't.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We have built a huge installed base around four platforms, iOS, Mac OS, watchOS and tvOS. We have tremendously satisfied and loyal customers who are engaged with our services at a fast growing rate. All of this provides us with an unparalleled foundation for the future of Apple business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Let me now turn to the details of our record breaking December quarter. As Tim said, revenue was $75.9 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion or 2% year-over-year. Our growth was driven by all-time record iPhone sales, all-time record revenue from services, the expanded availability of Apple Watch, and the successful launch of the new Apple TV.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We achieved this record revenue performance despite a very large negative impact from the weakness of foreign currency and in constant currency; our revenue growth rate was 8%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We once again achieved very impressive results in Greater China, with revenue growing 14% year-over-year and 47% sequentially to an all-time record of $18.4 billion. Emerging markets performance was strong overall, up 11% year-over-year and representing 34% of total company revenue for the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Company gross margin was 40.1%, up sequentially and better than our expectations, mainly due to favorable commodity costs and product mix.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Operating margin was 31.9% of revenue and net income was $18.4 billion, a new all-time record. Diluted earnings per share was $3.28, a 7% year-over-year increase over our previous all-time record and cash flow from operations was very strong, at $27.5 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">For details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 74.8 million iPhones in the quarter, an increase of 300,000 compared to last December quarter's sensational results. Total iPhone sales grew 76% in India and more than 45% in Korea, Middle East and Africa.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Sales were also up 20% or more in many western European countries and grew 18% in Mainland China. iPhone ASP was $691 compared to $687 in the year ago quarter, in spite of a very unfavorable foreign exchange impact.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We continue to see very strong interest in iPhone not only with consumers but also with business users. Among corporate buyers planning to purchase smartphones in the March quarter, 451 Research found that 79% planned to purchase iPhones. That is the highest iPhone purchase intent in the eight-year history of the survey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We started the quarter below our channel inventory target range and thanks to an extremely successful manufacturing ramp; we were able to exit the quarter slightly above the low end of our target range of five to seven weeks of iPhone channel inventory.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. We sold 5.3 million Macs compared to 5.5 million last year, a decline of 4%. We continued our long running trend of PC market share gains, based on IDC's latest estimate of an 11% global market contraction, and we were especially happy with 27% year-over-year Mac sales growth in Mainland China. We ended the quarter within our four to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Turning to iPad, we sold 16.1 million, compared to 21.4 million in the year ago quarter, and we exited the quarter within our five to seven-week target range of iPad channel inventory.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">In the segments of the tablet market where we compete, we continue to be highly successful. Recent data from NPD indicates that iPad has 85% share of the U.S. market for tablets priced above $200. And the latest data published by IDC indicates that iPad accounts for 67% of the U.S. commercial tablet market comprising enterprise, government, and education.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">iPad customer metrics are also extremely positive. In November, 451 Research measured a 97% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad Air 2 and among consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 65% plan to purchase an iPad. Corporate buyers reported a 95% satisfaction rate for iPad and a March quarter purchase intent of 73%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Our enterprise initiatives continue to expand. IBM released 48 new IBM MobileFirst for iOS apps in the December quarter and there are now over 100 apps in the IBM MobileFirst for iOS catalog for iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Our partnership with Cisco has gained significant momentum since we announced it at the end of August. Our engineering teams are on track to deliver exciting new capabilities that create a fast lane for iOS business users by optimizing Cisco networks for iOS devices and apps, integrate iPhone with Cisco enterprise environments and provide unique collaboration opportunities on iPhone and iPad.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We are also continuing to grow our mobility partner program. We added more than 25 partners in the December quarter, bringing the total to over 90. One great example of our progress in the enterprise is Eli Lilly, who boosted sales productivity by equipping 15,000 field based personnel across the world with iPad. A leader in mobile technology, Lilly has eliminated laptops in the field and is upgrading its U.S. field sales teams to iPad Pro.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Turning to services, we generated almost $6.1 billion in revenue, including $548 million we received from a patent infringement dispute. Excluding that amount, our services revenue was $5.5 billion, a new all-time record and an increase of 15% over last year, thanks in large part to strong growth from apps.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Revenue from the App Store increased 27% and the number of transacting customers grew 18%, also setting an all-time record. Among our customers who purchased apps and content from our iTunes stores, the average amount spent per customer reached an all-time high in the December quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Revenue from other products grew strongly, up 62% over last year, thanks to the growing contribution from Apple Watch, as well as the successful launch of the new Apple TV, both of which established new all-time quarterly records. We expanded Apple Watch distribution significantly over the course of the quarter and we experienced especially strong results during the holiday buying season.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $215.7 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $10.1 billion. $200 billion of this cash or 93% of the total was outside the United States.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We returned over $9 billion to investors during the quarter. We paid $3 billion in dividends and equivalents and we spent $3 billion to repurchase 26 million Apple shares through open market transactions. We also launched our sixth accelerated share repurchase program, spending $3 billion and receiving an initial delivery of 20.4 million shares.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We have now completed over $153 billion of our $200 billion program, including $110 billion in share repurchases. As we have done in the past, we plan to provide an update on our capital return program when we report our second quarter results in April.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We also plan to be very active in the U.S. and international debt markets in 2016, in order to fund our capital return activities. Also today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.52 per share of common stock payable on February 11, 2016, to shareholders of record as of February 8, 2016.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">As we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We expect revenue to be between $50 billion and $53 billion. We are providing a wider range for revenue than usual for the second quarter because of the volatility we are seeing in the economy and in the financial and currency markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We expect gross margin to be between 39% and 39.5%. We believe these are extremely strong margins in light of the headwinds we face from foreign exchange and the sequential loss of leverage. We expect OpEx to be between $6 billion and $6.1 billion, we expect OI&amp;E to be about $325 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 25.5%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">As you know, we don't provide guidance beyond the current quarter and it's difficult for us to forecast economic and foreign exchange factors; however, at this point, we believe the March quarter faces the most difficult year-over-year compare relative to the rest of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Thank you, Luca. And we ask that you limit yourself to one one-part question and one follow-up. May we have the first question please?</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p6\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">[Operator Instructions]</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Your first question will come from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Simona Jankowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Hi, thank you very much. Just in terms of your March quarter guidance, it does imply a double-digit decline at the midpoint. Maybe if you can just clarify, first of all, what FX headwind is embedded in that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">And then just going to the fundamental underpinning reasons for that, how much of it do you think has to do with international markets in terms of weakening demand and how much of that do you think is comps versus any other factors you might identify, such as a response to higher prices for the iPhone in certain overseas markets?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Luca Maestri</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Thank you, Simona. Let me take this one. In constant currency, when you look at it for the March quarter, revenue would be down between 5% and 10%. So, we are looking at a 400 basis point impact from foreign exchange for the March quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">You talked about a number of issues that are, in fact, included in this guidance. In addition to lapping, of course, a very strong year ago quarter -- just remind you that revenue growth a year ago was up 27%, there's a number of things that we're facing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">The macroeconomic environment is weakening. When you think about all the -- particularly all the commodity-driven economies, Brazil and Russia and emerging markets, but also Canada, Australia in developed markets, clearly the economy is significantly weaker than a year ago. We talked about the unfavorable FX, which again is 400 basis points.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">One of the things that we've done to respond to the foreign exchange situation has been to increase the price of some of our products in certain international markets. That has had the effect of protecting our margins, which you've seen have been very strong, both in the December quarter and in the guidance that we provide for the March quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">But inevitably over time, higher prices affect demand and so we're capturing that in our guidance. So, I would say these are the major reasons and the drivers for the guidance on revenue.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Simona Jankowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Nancy Paxton</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Thank you, Simona. Could we have the next question please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">And next from Piper Jaffray, we'll hear from Gene Munster.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gene Munster</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Good afternoon. Tim, could you talk a little bit about the iPhone upgrade program and the theme of iPhone as a subscription? In particular, do you believe that this could have a measurable impact on the December quarter once we anniversary this? And then any thoughts on rolled outside the U.S. when that program would.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And I guess my follow-up question would be I know you can't talk about new products, but any high level thoughts on the virtual reality theme. Do you think this is more of a geeky niche or something that could go mainstream?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Cook</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">On your first question about iPhone, I think the most important thing, Gene, as you know for us, will always be the product and the experience. And so that's first and foremost. Secondly, I would say we were blown away by the level of Android switchers that we had last quarter. It was the highest ever by far. And so we see that as a huge opportunity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Thirdly, the markets, sort of the emerging markets broader than BRIC, but including all of emerging, when I look at our share in these markets and the LTE penetration, I see huge opportunities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">In terms of the upgrade program itself, I think over time, it will be meaningful as customers get into a different pattern. How much of that plays out in the Q1 of 2017 range is difficult to say. My own sense would be that the other items I've mentioned are probably more important but I am optimistic about the upgrade program as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gene Munster</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And then virtual reality?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Cook</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Yeah. In terms of virtual reality, no, I don't think it's a niche. I think it can be -- it's really cool and has some interesting applications.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Nancy Paxton</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Thank you, Gene.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gene Munster</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Nancy Paxton</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Could we have the next question please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">From Morgan Stanley, Katy Huberty.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Katy Huberty</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Yes, thanks. I appreciate the macro comments as it relates to guidance, but can you talk a little bit about how you're thinking consumers might react from an ASP perspective? Do you expect consumers to move down the product line, given the macro environment?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And then also, how is channel inventory influencing guidance? Do you feel like channel inventory needs to come down, given the demand trends? And then I have a follow-up.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Luca Maestri</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Couple of points here, Katy. Our iPhone ASP was $691 during the December quarter. We couldn't be happier with the level of ASP that we generated in the December quarter. Keep in mind that the foreign exchange impact on that number was $49. So, obviously, the mix of products was very strong. We had great reception for the new iPhones that we launched at the end of September. Of course, we have a very strong mid-tier this year in the portfolio, with 6 and 6 Plus.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">But overall, when you look at the outcome during the December quarter, it was very, very strong. So, we feel very good about that and we feel that we have a very, very strong portfolio for iPhone.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">On the question around channel inventory, we entered the quarter, the December quarter -- and we mentioned it back in October below our target range of five to seven weeks. We have built a bit of inventory during the course of the December quarter. But we have exited at the low end of the five to seven weeks. So, we feel that we are in good shape there. And we've exited the quarter also on iPad and Mac well within the ranges that we want to have.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Katy Huberty</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And then as a follow-up, back in October you guided fiscal 2016 CapEx up over 30%. What's driving that growth? Can you sort of rank it between equipment purchases, data center, and real estate? And given the slowdown that you started to see in December, are you still comfortable with that level of investment growth? Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Luca Maestri</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Yes. So that is kind of the ranking, Katy. It starts always for us with our tooling and manufacturing process equipment and that is up a bit year-over-year. Then we've got data centers and data centers is a growing expenditure for us, because, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, our installed base of customers and devices is growing, and is growing very significantly. And the data center capacity that we put in place is to provide the services that are tied to the installed base. So, that type of expenditure goes together with the installed base.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And then around facilities, you probably know that we are nearing completion of our new campus here in Cupertino, and so this is the year where we've got our peak requirements in terms of capital.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Nancy Paxton</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thank you, Katy. Could we have the next question please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">From Bernstein, we'll hear from Toni Sacconaghi.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Toni Sacconaghi</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yes. Thank you. I have a question, a follow-up, please. To start, just on iPhones, it looks like your guidance implies about a 15% to 20% unit decline in iPhones for fiscal Q2, which I think, unless you really see a change in demand profile in the second half, suggests that iPhone units will decline year-over-year for fiscal 2016.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And I'd like you to address that question, because the obvious follow-up questions are is that because you believe the smartphone market won't grow or because Apple may be reaching saturation in the market? Is that because Apple's replacement cycle accelerated last year and is decelerating this year and that's why we'll see a decline in units?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Or is there something about Apple's ability to gain share in a market where the market is moving to much lower price points? But I'm wondering, and Tim, maybe you're best to answer it, if you can address what appears likely to be a decline in iPhone units and how we put that in the context of how we should think about that, given some healthy data around switchers that you highlighted.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Cook</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Toni, we do think that iPhone units will decline in the quarter. We don't think that they will decline to the levels that you're talking about. We aren't projecting beyond the quarter, as Luca mentioned earlier. But at this point in time, we see that Q2 is the toughest compare.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">We believe it's the toughest compare because of the year ago quarter also had catch up in it from Q1. If you recall, we were heavily supply constrained throughout the whole of Q1 and so some of that demand moved into Q2.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Plus we're in an environment now that is dramatically different from a macroeconomic point of view than last Q2, from a currency point of view, from the level of which we've had to adjust pricing in several of these markets, and sort pf the overall [Indiscernible] in virtually every country in the world. And so it's really all of those factors that play in there and it's difficult to sort out how much is due to which one.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Toni Sacconaghi</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Right. I mean can you speak to any of the points around your expectation for the smartphone market or whether you think your replacement cycle has changed or whether your ability to gain share has changed?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Cook</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">The market itself, we don't spend a lot of time on predicting. Our view has always been that if we do -- if we make a great product and have a great experience that we ought to be able to convince enough people to move over.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And so as I look at sort of your -- maybe your broader umbrella point about a question on saturation, the metrics I see would strongly suggest otherwise. For example, almost half of the iPhones that we sold in China last quarter were to people who were buying their first iPhone.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And certainly if you go outside of China into the other emerging markets, our share is much lower and the LTE penetration is so low, I mean in some cases, it's zero, that it indicates to me that there's still a lot of people, a tremendous number of people in the world, that will buy smartphones and we ought to be able to win over our fair share of those.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Toni Sacconaghi</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. And I just have clarifications; I don't really have a follow-up question. Luca you had talked about channel inventory increasing, it was 18.4 million for iPhone last quarter. Can you tell us how many more units you had this quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And then I'm not sure if I misheard you, but I think you said your total installed base grew 25% year-over-year. Can you confirm that? Because if services grew at 13% and your installed base grew at 25%, it almost implies your penetration of your installed base, in terms of your ability to sell services, is going down.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Luca Maestri</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So, -- maybe I'm going to start with services, Toni. The reason why we added this -- I think it's page three of our supplemental material, is to try and explain that a couple of steps. The first one is that of the services that we report, there's a portion, about 85% of all of the services that we report is directly tied to the installed base.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">There is a smaller portion of our services business that is not related to installed base and more related to when we sell a device. A perfect example would be an Apple Care agreement that you purchase at the time of the sale of the device.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And then we are showing that on that portion of installed base driven services business, there is a part that is related to -- where we recognize revenue in terms of the full transaction value. And then there are transactions, like for example, App Store sales, where a portion of the transaction does not get recognized by Apple, but it goes to the developer.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So, when you look at it from a purchase value standpoint, actually in the December quarter, we grew 24%, and for the fiscal 2015, we grew at 23%. So, we are growing at very, very healthy levels okay. And to reconfirm the growth of the installed base, yes, it was over 25%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">To the question around the channel inventory for iPhone, we grew channel inventory by 3.3 million units during the course of the December quarter. Keep in mind; we started in acquisition where we were below our targeted range. We were significantly short at the beginning of the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Toni Sacconaghi</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Nancy Paxton</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thank you, Toni. Could we have the next question please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">From Cross Research, Shannon Cross.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Shannon Cross</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thank you very much. I had a question about gross margin. Luca, you got gross margins of 39% to 39.5% in your guidance and that includes hedging. So, I'm curious about the puts or takes in there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And then can you clarify if within the gross margin this quarter that had the IP licensing contribution, as well? Any color you can give, both on this quarter's gross margin puts and takes, and then also the March quarter. And then I have a follow-up.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Luca Maestri</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yes. So, -- certainly Shannon, let me start with Q1. I think when you say IP licensing; you mean this patent dispute that was resolved. Yes, it was included in the gross margins and it was worth 40 basis points in the 40.1% that we reported for Q1.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">For the second quarter, the puts and takes are actually quite simple. From an FX standpoint, the negative impact on a sequential basis from the December quarter is 50 basis points.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Then of course, I would say by far the largest impact on margins for the quarter is the loss of leverage, because that's part of our seasonal pattern, which gets offset by a favorable commodity environment that we've seen for a number of quarters now. And in a way, it's the other side of the coin of the foreign exchange situation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Shannon Cross</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. Thanks. And then Tim, can you talk a bit about -- and I apologize, I sort of lost my voice here. Can you talk a bit about leverage within the model? I know you said you want to invest while there's great opportunity in China and all of that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">But given some of the pressures you're seeing, how do you think about where you spend that incremental SG&amp;A dollar and that R&amp;D dollar? And how should we think about it, given you're running $6 billion a quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Cook</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yeah, on the R&amp;D, Shannon, we're continuing to invest without pause. We have some great things in the pipeline and we very much believe strongly in investing through downturns, such as the one that everyone is going through.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">In terms of SG&amp;A, we obviously seek to throttle expenditures in SG&amp;A to the business level, with the exception of where we're investing in new stores and, for example, our expansion plans in China have not changed.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We are maintaining our investment profile and plans there. We are also continuing to invest in markets where we believe they are great places for Apple for the long-term, like India, as an example of that one.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And finally, even in the markets where today, grandly, it looks fairly bleak, from Russia and Brazil and some of the other economies that are very much tied to our oil-based economies.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We do believe that this, too, shall pass and that these countries will be great places and we want to serve customers in there and so we're not retrenching. That's not -- we don't believe in that. We fortunately are strong enough to continue investing and we think it's in Apple's best long-term interest to do so.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Obviously, from a cost point of view, the downside of economic stress is that some asset prices get cheaper, commodity prices get cheaper, and that sort of thing. And so I think this is exactly the period that you want to invest and do so confidently.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Shannon Cross</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Nancy Paxton</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Thank you, Shannon. Could we have the next question please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We'll hear from Steve Milunovich with UBS.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Nancy Paxton</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Steve, are you there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Cook</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Steve?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Nancy Paxton</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Let's go on to the next question please.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And we'll hear from Brian White with Drexel.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian White</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Tim, could you talk a little bit about the next leg of growth in China? Obviously, Apple has done a phenomenal job there, but where do we see the next leg coming from? And also, you mentioned investing in India. Where do you see that over the next two to three years? I think there's 1 billion mobile subscribers there, almost the size of China. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Cook</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yeah. Brian, good question. In terms of China, the LTE penetration as of the end of last October, which is the last data I've got, was in the mid-20s. And so there's an enormous upgrade cycle there for people that are still running on 3G handsets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Also, I've talked about this before, but I think it's worth mentioning again, because it's easy to lose perspective with some of the things you read every day, is that the middle-class in China was less than 50 million people in 2010, and by 2020, it's projected to be about half a billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And so there's just an enormous number of people moving into the middle-class. And we think this provides us a great opportunity to win over some of those customers into the Apple ecosystem.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And so I think the demographics are great. We're continuing to invest in retail stores. Angela and her team have been on this very aggressive rollout plan. We now have 28 stores in Greater China and we're on target to have 40 in the summertime of this year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And so we're continuing on distribution. Obviously, we've got product things in mind and are crafting our products and services with China heavily in mind. We remain very bullish on China and don't subscribe to the doom and gloom kind of predictions frankly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">In India, India is also incredibly exciting. India's growth, as you know, is very good. It's quickly becoming the fastest growing BRIC country. It's the third largest smartphone market in the world, behind China and the United States.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">The population of India is incredibly young. The median age there is 27. I think of the China age being young, at 36, 37 and so 27 is unbelievable. Almost half the people in India are below 25. And so I see the demographics there also being incredibly great for a consumer brand and for people that really want the best products.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And as you know, we've been putting increasingly more energy in India. India revenue for us in Q1 was up 38%. We also had currency issues in India, as everybody else did. Constant currency growth was 48%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And so it's a very rapidly expanding country. And I think the government there is very interested economic reforms and so forth that I think all speak to a really good business environment for the future.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian White</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay, great. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Cook</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yeah.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Nancy Paxton</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thank you, Brian. Could we have the next question please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">We'll hear from Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kulbinder Garcha</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thank you. My question's for Tim on the iPhone business. You talk a lot about the macroeconomic weakness weighing on units, but is some of the issue just that last year replacement got accelerated and this year it's kind of normalizing, and that's kind of a one-time headwind in terms of the unit growth that you see in that business. Is any of that going on, or is that not material, in your view?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And the other follow-up I had was that you've mentioned in recent calls, helpfully, the percent of the base, prior to when the 6 came out, that were now on the larger screen phones. Can you give us an update on what that number is? I think the last time it was in the low 30s. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Cook</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yeah. So, last question first. The number of people who had an iPhone prior to the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus announcements -- and so this was in September of 2014 that have not yet upgraded to a 6, 6 Plus or 6s or 6s Plus is now 60%. So, another way to think about that is 40% have, 60% have not.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">In terms of your initial question about is there some of the compare issue that are people that ran out quickly to buy a 6 and 6 Plus and sort of accelerated? There is no doubt that we had a unbelievable year last year and the Q2 was particularly really, really strong because of the pent-up demand that left from Q1 in addition to Q2. And so there's no doubt about that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">However, I think you can tell from the numbers that Luca is talking about just on the currency side and that's before thinking through the affect that price increases can sometimes have on the business over a period of time, it's clear that the economic piece is large.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kulbinder Garcha</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Nancy Paxton</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thank you, Kulbinder. Could we have the next question please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And next we'll hear from Steve Milunovich with UBS. Mr. Milunovich, you may want to check your mute button.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Cook</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Steve, are you there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Nancy Paxton</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. Let's try the next question please.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And we'll hear from Mark Moskowitz with Barclays.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mark Moskowitz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. A question and a follow-up. As far as the question, Tim, I wanted to get a better sense from you in terms of what is the overarching message of introducing a little more details here around services. Is this really to just reinforce the power of the franchise or the platform at Apple in terms of to really navigate tougher macro times in terms of the higher level recurring revenue, or is it a stepping stone to much more in terms of Apple service, i.e. I think of all the stuff you do on the data center side. Could we eventually have seen, with the help of IBM and Cisco that you eventually move more into the cloud services for the enterprise?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Cook</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So, good question. We started breaking out services, as you know, in the beginning of fiscal year 2015. And as that business has grown and as it became clear to us that the investors wanted -- investors and analysts wanted more visibility into that business, we've now elected to break it out and show the full size, scope, growth, and make comments on the profitability of it from a transparency point of view.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I do think that the assets that we have in this area are huge and I do think that it's probably something that the investment community would want to and should focus more on.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">In terms of our future plans, I wouldn't want to comment about any particular thing, but obviously, with breaking this out, we wouldn't be breaking it out if it wasn't an area that was very important to us in the future.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mark Moskowitz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Cook</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mark Moskowitz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And I wanted to follow-up on the upgrade advance program dynamics. Can you talk a little more about what you're seeing in terms of in-store at the Apple Stores? Are you seeing any sort of dislocation in terms of folks who are moving to the upgrade or finance program, are they moving more toward Apple versus maybe the in-store percentage that used to be related to the carriers?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">In other words, are folks just going with Apple now, instead of the carriers, when they buy their phone, as part of these upgrade programs?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Cook</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">No, I don't -- honestly, this has nothing to do with wanting to move customers from one person to another. This has to do with wanting to provide customers a very simple way to upgrade. Because we serve a significant number of customers in the Apple Store who want the iPhone when it's new and when it comes out, and so we've designed a program that made it simple and easy to do that. I have no idea over time how the percentage of the sales will vary between carriers and the Apple retail store, but that's not our overriding objective.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mark Moskowitz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. Thank you. Good afternoon.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Nancy Paxton</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Thank you, Mark. We have time for one more question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And your final question will come from Jim Suva with Citi.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Suva</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Thank you very much. A question for Tim and then a detail follow-up for Luca. Tim, with the macro situation changing, a lot of CEOs view that and their strategy is very different go-to-market strategy, some change the way they go to market, some change their products.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">In the past, Apple's been very known in always having a premium product. With the slowdown in the macro FX and also GDP revision, is Apple's strategy go-to-market still always at premium product, or is there a need to go to more also a middle market or lower price point to attract more customers? Just because it seems like growing that installed base and services, as you pointed out, really economically could really help out Apple in the long-term.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And then the financial question for Luca is on that patent litigation, Luca, when you gave guidance three months ago, did you have a view that that was coming in? And if so, was that included in the guidance or not, or was that post the quarter guidance?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And I assume it's all one-time this quarter you recorded it, it's all gross margin, and then we don't cause that to reoccur again going forward. Thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Cook</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Our strategy is always to make the best products. And that -- for the smartphone market, that we are able to provide though several different price points for our customers. We have the premium part of our line is the 6s and the 6s Plus.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">We also have a mid-price point, with the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus. And we continue to offer the iPhone 5s in the market and it continues to do quite well. And so we offer all of those and I don't see us deviating from that approach.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">We always want to offer somebody the -- not -- we don't design to a certain price point. We design a great product and we make it priced at a great value. And today, we're able to offer all three of those different iPhone options.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Luca Maestri</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And Jim, on the patent question, yes, obviously this is a one-off item that affected the December quarter. As I said earlier, it's worth 40 basis points. So, without it, our gross margin would have been 39.7%. It will not repeat going forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">To your question around was it included in the guidance, yes, the probability of receiving the amount was incorporated in the development of the guidance range. If you remember, we guided to 39% to 40%, and that number was included within the range.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Suva</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Thank you very much gentlemen.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Thank you, Jim. A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks, podcast on the iTunes store, webcast on apple.com/investor, and via telephone.

Today's call is being recorded.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Nancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Speaking first is Apple CEO Tim Cook, and he'll be followed by CFO Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margins, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, future business outlook, and plans for capital return and debt issuance. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2015, the Form 10-Q for the first quarter of fiscal 2016, and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">In addition, today's comments will refer to a metric we describe as the purchase value of services tied to our installed base. This is a non-GAAP measure, and a reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measure can be found on our Investor Relations website at Apple.com/investor.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Timothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today we're reporting the results of a very busy and challenging quarter, and we're also announcing an update to our capital return program.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Revenue for the quarter was $50.6 billion, which was within our guidance range. Despite the pause in our growth, our results reflect excellent execution by our team in the face of ongoing macroeconomic headwinds in much of the world and difficult year-over-year comparisons. We saw continued currency weakness in the vast majority of our international markets. In constant currency, our revenue declined by 9% from last year, 400 basis points less than the reported decline of 13%. For the first half of the fiscal year, our revenue in constant currency was up 1% year on year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Despite challenges, there were a number of encouraging signs during the quarter. Our installed base of over 1 billion active devices continued to grow strongly. We added a huge number of Android switchers and new-to-Mac customers, and we generated very strong growth from Services. We sold 51.2 million iPhones in the quarter, consistent with the range of our own expectations but lower than the exceptional year-ago quarter when we saw an acceleration in iPhone upgrades and 40% iPhone sales growth over the previous year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">To provide some additional color, iPhone sales come from three sources: customers who upgrade from previous iPhone models; customers who switch from Android and other operating systems; and customers who purchase a smartphone for the first time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">As we look at each of these three sources of iPhone sales, we see a business that is healthy and strong. First, from an upgrade perspective, during the first half of this year the upgrade rate for the iPhone 6s cycle has been slightly higher than what we experienced in the iPhone 5s cycle two years ago, but it is lower than the accelerated upgrade rate that we saw with iPhone 6, which as you know was a big contributor to our phenomenal revenue growth a year ago. Most importantly, our customers are incredibly loyal. A recent Kantar survey of U.S. smartphone purchasers indicated a 95% iPhone loyalty rate, the highest ever measured for any smartphone.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Second, we continue to see a very high level of customers switching to iPhone from Android and other operating systems. In fact, we added more switchers from Android and other platforms in the first half of this year than any other six-month period ever.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">And third, with only 42% smartphone penetration of the global handset market today, iPhone is still attracting millions of first-time smartphone buyers each quarter, especially from emerging markets. For example, in India our iPhone sales were up 56% from a year ago.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Next I'd like to talk about Services, which was our second largest revenue-generating category during the quarter. Setting aside the amount we received from a patent settlement in the December quarter, the March quarter Services revenue was our highest ever. Services revenue jumped 20% to $6 billion. App Store revenue was up 35% to beat last quarter's all-time record. And Apple Music continues to grow in popularity, with over 13 million paying subscribers today. We feel really great about the early success of Apple's first subscription business, and our Music revenue has now hit an inflection point after many quarters of decline.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">The Services business is powered by our huge installed base of active devices, which crossed 1 billion units earlier this year. As we discussed on this call in January, those 1 billion-plus active devices are a source of recurring revenue that is growing independent of the unit shipments we report every three months. In fact, the purchase value of services tied to our installed base was a record $9.9 billion in the March quarter, up 27% over last year, accelerating from the 24% growth rate we reported in the December quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">The reach of Apple Pay also continues to expand following a very successful launch in China in the March quarter and last week's rollout in Singapore. Apple Pay is growing at a tremendous rate, with more than five times the transaction volume of a year ago and 1 million new users per week. There are more than 10 million contactless-ready locations in the countries where Apple Pay has launched to date, including over 2.5 million locations now accepting Apple Pay in the United States, and more expansion of Apple Pay is coming soon.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Turning to the Mac, we met our sell-in expectations in addition to reducing channel inventory by about 100,000 units. Overall, the Mac continues to attract a large percentage of new customers. In our latest survey of major markets, over half of buyers were new to the Mac. And in some countries, the percentage is extremely high, like in China, where over 80% of customers were purchasing a Mac for the first time. We're confident in our Mac business and our ability to continue to innovate and gain share in that area.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Turning to the Apple Watch, unit sales met our expectations in the quarter. For some color on how we think about Apple Watch sales, we expect its seasonality to be similar to the historical seasonality of iPod, which typically generated 40% or more of its annual unit sell-through in the December quarter. We started shipping Apple Watch just one year ago, and it has quickly become the best-selling and most loved smartwatch in the world. In fact, unit sales of Apple Watch during its first year exceeded sales of iPhone in its first year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Last month, we refreshed the lineup for the spring with new bands and a new starting price point, and the response from customers has been great. Apple Watch is an increasingly essential part of users' lives, from responding to messages, managing calendars and navigating with maps, to helping them be more fit. And in some cases, the heart rate sensor has even helped save lives. We're really excited about the first year with Apple Watch. We have learned a lot, and we believe it has an exciting future head.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We announced some fantastic new products during the March quarter. IPhone SE became available on March 31, so none of its sales were reflected in our second quarter results. But so far this quarter we're seeing terrific customer response. IPhone SE is the most powerful four-inch phone ever, and it's a great option for customers all over the world who want a compact phone with advanced features and a great price without compromising performance. Demand has been very strong and exceeds supply at this point, but we're working hard to get the iPhone SE into the hands of every customer who wants one as quickly as possible. The addition of the iPhone SE in the iPhone lineup places us in a better strategic position to attract even more customers into our ecosystem.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We also unveiled the stunning 9.7-inch iPad Pro with cutting-edge performance and our most advanced display yet. The reviews of our new iPad Pros have been great, and we're hearing from customers that the features and capabilities in the new Pros make them both the ultimate upgrade for iPad owners and a great PC replacement. In the June quarter, we expect to see our best iPad revenue compare in over two years. IPad is the best selling, best reviewed, and most used tablet on the market. Customers tell us that they love iPad for its unique mix of portability, capability, and versatility, with over 1 million iPad apps in the App Store to help them work, play, learn, and create.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We also announced CareKit, a new software framework that developers can use to help people take a more active role in their health by keeping track of their care plans, monitoring their symptoms and medication, and delivering the insights they need to make smart decisions about their health. We're very excited about the ways iPhone and Apple Watch are helping people lead healthier lives. We believe there's great promise here for the future, and we are very interested in where this can take us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">As always, we're contributing to society beyond our products, promoting the use of renewable energy across our facilities and inside our supply chain and developing cutting-edge technologies to revolutionize recycling of the materials we use. We are unwavering in our commitment to protect the security and privacy of our customers and their data, and we're actively promoting inclusion and equality across our business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">As we continue through the June quarter, I'd like to remind you that we measure the health of customer demand based on sell-through. Despite ending Q2 within our channel inventory targets, in light of the macroeconomic environment, we plan to lower our channel inventories in the June quarter. This will impact our reported revenue in Q3. Luca will provide more details on this in his commentary.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">But before I turn over the call to him, I'll summarize by saying that the future of Apple is very bright. Our product pipeline has amazing innovations in store. We're very excited about bringing together developers for our four major platforms at our Worldwide Developers Conference in June. We are forging ahead with important investments in research and development, in our infrastructure, and in our supply chain. We've made 15 acquisitions in the last four quarters to accelerate our product and Services roadmaps, and we're always on the lookout for companies with great technology, talent, and strategic fit.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Creating value for shareholders by developing great products and services that enrich people's lives will always be our top priority and the key factor driving our investment and capital allocation decisions. As our business continues to generate high levels of free cash flow, we are in the fortunate position to expand our capital return program again this year, as we have done each year since we started the program four years ago. Today we're announcing an extension of the timeframe of the program by four quarters through March of 2018, and we are expanding the total program size from $200 billion to $250 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Luca has more details on this announcement and our results for the March quarter. Luca?</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Luca Maestri - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Senior Vice President</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start with the March quarter results.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Revenue for the quarter landed within our guidance range of $50.6 billion compared to $58 billion in the year-ago quarter, a decline of 13%. As we had expected, our comparisons to last year were influenced by the continued strength of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies. As Tim said, in constant currency, our revenue declined by 9%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On a geographic basis, in Asia, our revenue grew strongly in Japan, but it declined in greater China and the rest of Asia-Pacific. However, our business in these two regions is faring better than the numbers might suggest. We had significant channel inventory reductions and currency weakness, which affected our reported revenue for both these segments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In Mainland China, revenue was down 11%, and the decline was 7% in constant currency terms. Keep in mind that we were up against an extremely difficult year-ago compare when our Mainland China revenue grew 81%. We remain very optimistic about the China market over the long term, and we are committed to investing there for the long run.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Gross margin was 39.4%, near the high end of our guidance range, thanks to strong cost performance. Operating margin was 27.7% of revenue, and net income was $10.5 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.90, and cash flow from operations was strong at $11.6 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">For details by product, I'll start with iPhone. We sold 51.2 million iPhones in the quarter compared to 61.2 million in the year-ago quarter, a decline of 16%. It was a particularly challenging comparison to the record quarter a year ago, when iPhone sales grew 40%, as we entered last March quarter in supply/demand imbalance, which was recovered during the quarter. Also, this year we reduced channel inventory by 450,000 units while we increased inventory by 1 million units a year ago. We have exited the quarter within our five-week to seven-week target range for channel inventory.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">iPhone ASP was $642 compared to $659 in the year-ago quarter, with weak international currencies and very popular mid-tier and entry offerings contributing to the difference year over year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">iPhone's momentum in business markets continues to be very impressive. A recent survey by 451 Research, formerly known as ChangeWave, found that among U.S. corporate buyers planning to purchase smartphones in the June quarter, 78% plan to purchase iPhones. That's the highest June quarter iPhone purchase intent ever measured by the survey and five points higher than a year ago.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to Services, we generated $6 billion in revenue, an increase of 20% over the March quarter last year, thanks primarily to the continued strong performance of the App Store, with revenue growing 35% to a new all-time high. According to App Annie, the App Store generated 90% more global revenue than Google Play in the March quarter, up from a 75% lead in 2015. Among our customers who purchased apps and content from our iTunes Store's, the average amount spent per customer reached a new all-time record in the March quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. We sold 4 million Macs compared to 4.6 million last year, a decline of 12%. It was a challenging quarter for personal computer sales across the industry, but we believe we gained market share. Despite the overall market slowdown, we generated double-digit Mac growth in a number of markets, including Russia, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, and the UAE.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">And just last week we updated the MacBook, our thinnest and lightest Mac, with the latest processors, faster graphics, faster flash storage, and longer battery life. We think our customers are going to love this update. We ended the quarter within our four-week to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Turning to iPad, we sold 10.3 million units compared to 12.6 million units in the year-ago quarter. We also reduced channel inventory by about 200,000 units, and we exited the quarter within our five-week to seven-week target range.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">In the segments of the tablet market where we compete, we continue to be highly successful. Recent data from NPD indicates that iPad has 78% share of the U.S. market for tablets priced above $200. And the latest data published by IDC indicates that iPad accounts for 72% of the U.S. commercial tablet market, comprising business, government, and education.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">iPad customer metrics are also extremely positive. In February, 451 Research measured a 97% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad Air 2. And among consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 59% plan to purchase an iPad, more than three times the purchase intention rate of the next highest brand measured. Corporate buyers reported a 94% satisfaction rate for iPad, and the June quarter purchase intent of 71%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Revenue from other products grew 30% over last year thanks to Apple Watch. We have expanded distribution to 60 countries and introduced bands in beautiful new colors for spring, so customers can personalize their watches in more ways with a range of colors, styles, and materials. Our customers are very happy with Apple Watch, with 451 Research measuring 94% customer satisfaction.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We're also making great progress with our enterprise initiatives. IBM now has engagements for more than 200 deployments of native iOS apps for large enterprise customers to accelerate mobile transformation. Our Mobility Partner program also continues to grow, with 108 partners across 20 countries.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We see continued broad industry adoption of native iOS apps to transform how professionals do their work and serve their customers. For example, retail bankers are using iOS apps on iPads to greet and onboard customers, reduce queue times, and improve the customer experience. And in hospitals, doctors and nurses are using iOS apps on iPhone and iPad to share and communicate more effectively so that they can spend more time with patients and less time on administrative tasks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $232.9 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $17.2 billion. $208.9 billion of this cash, or 90% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $15.5 billion in U.S. dollar denominated notes during the quarter, including our first green bond tranche to fund initiatives such as renewable energy and environmental design projects. We exited the March quarter with $72 billion in term debt.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We returned $10 billion to investors during the quarter, including $2.9 billion in dividends and equivalents and $7 billion on repurchases of 71.8 million Apple shares through open market transactions. We have now completed over $163 billion of the current $200 billion capital return program, including $117 billion in share repurchases.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">As Tim mentioned, today we are announcing the latest update to our program, which we are increasing to a total of $250 billion. Once again, we're allocating the majority of the expansion of the program to share repurchases. Given our strong confidence in Apple's future and the value we see in our stock, the board has increased the share repurchase authorization by $35 billion, raising it from the current $140 billion level to $175 billion. We will also continue to net share settle vesting employee restricted stock units.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We also know that the dividend is very important to many of our investors who value income, and we are raising it for the fourth time in less than four years. The quarterly dividend will grow from $0.52 per share to $0.57 per share, an increase of about 10%. This is effective with our next dividend, which the board has declared today and is payable on May 12, 2016 to shareholders of record as of May 9, 2016. We continue to plan for annual dividend increases going forward. With $12 billion in annual dividend payments, we are proud to be one of the largest dividend payers in the world. In total, with this updated program, during the next eight quarters we expect to return $87 billion to our investors, which represents about 15% of our market cap at the current stock price.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">As in the past, we expect to fund our capital return program with U.S. cash, future U.S. cash flow generation, and borrowing from both domestic and international debt markets. We will continue to review capital allocation regularly and solicit input on our program from a broad base of shareholders. This allows us to be thoughtful about the size, the mix, and the pace of the program.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $41 billion and $43 billion. The revenue guidance implies a year-over-year decline as we lap an incredibly strong June quarter last year where revenue grew 33%, due in part to accelerated iPhone upgrade purchases. This tough compare is compounded by the continued weak macro environment this year and the strong U.S. dollar, which affects our revenue growth in international markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Embedded in this guidance is a planned channel inventory reduction worth over $2 billion, as we have elected to be prudent about our channel inventory position given the current macro environment. The guidance also reflects a range of possible scenarios related to how quickly we can get into supply/demand balance for iPhone SE. Due to these factors, our expected demand is greater than the revenue range implies.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Sequentially, our guidance implies a revenue decline of 15% to 19%, which is comparable to the 17% sequential decline that we've averaged from the March to June quarter for the last three years, despite the anticipated channel inventory adjustments I just described. We expect seasonal sequential declines in iPhone and iPad sales and a sequential increase in Mac sales. We also expect iPhone ASPs to decline sequentially as we get farther from the launch of iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus and as iPhone SE enters the mix.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We know that our revenue guidance falls short of market estimates for the third quarter. We believe the difference comes primarily from three areas: first, the $2 billion-plus channel inventory reduction I just mentioned; second, the effect of the channel inventory reduction and the launch of iPhone SE on iPhone ASPs, as well as the current constrained supply of iPhone SE; and third, different estimates for Mac, which we expect to grow sequentially at a rate similar to what we have experienced in the past June quarters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We expect gross margins to be between 37.5% and 38%. We expect continued cost improvements to be more than offset by the sequential loss of leverage from lower revenue and a different mix of products. We expect OpEx to be between $6 billion and $6.1 billion. We expect OI&amp;E to be about $300 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 25.5%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Nancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Thank you, Luca. And we ask that you limit yourself to one one-part question and one follow-up. Operator, may we have the first question, please?</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p7\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">First we'll hear with Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Hi, thank you so much. My first question was actually just a clarification in terms of putting in context that $2 billion in channel inventory reduction. What was that last year, just to help us make the comparison on a year-over-year basis?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And then the bigger question, Tim, was with the smartphone market now reaching a pretty mature growth phase, how does Apple think of itself going forward? Is it as a growth company, or is it a more mature tech company? And if it's still the former, how does that change how you think about M&amp;A, especially given the position you're in with your balance sheet strategically?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Luca Maestri - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Senior Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Simona, let me give you the data points on the sell-through, and then I'll let Tim answer the strategic question. We had a channel inventory reduction that was worth a bit less than $800 million a year ago.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Simona, hi, it's Tim. In terms of do I think the smartphone market</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">is mature, I think that the market, as you know, is currently not growing. However, my view of that is that's an overhang of the macroeconomic environment in many different places in the world. And we're very optimistic that this too shall pass and that the market and particularly us will grow again.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">The reason that we're optimistic is we look at the three places that iPhone sales come from. And from an upgrade point of view as I mentioned in my comments, we compare favorably, slightly better than the upgrade cycle that we saw on the iPhone 5s. We're lower than the iPhone 6, but I think all of us know that that was an extraordinary cycle that accelerated upgrades from 2016 into 2015. And so that comparable will be tough for this year, but that's a transitory thing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">As we look at switchers, we're extremely excited that for the first half we set a record from switchers from other platforms, the largest we've ever seen in any six-month period before, so we've got traction there. And then on emerging markets, if you take a look at India, we grew by 56%, and we're placing increasing emphasis in these areas, where it's clear there will be disproportionate growth versus the more developed areas.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">The next thing is with the iPhone SE, we have seen our ability to attract even more customers into the platform with an incredible product that is at a new price point for us with the latest technology, and so we're optimistic about attracting even more customers with that. We also look at our pipeline, and we're very excited about what's in our pipeline. And so all of those things make me optimistic.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Your other question was on M&amp;A. Regardless of the first, we're always looking in the market about things that could complement things that we do today, become features in something we do, or allow us to accelerate entry into a category that we're excited about. And so as I said before, our test is not on the size. We would definitely buy something larger than we've bought thus far. It's more about the strategic fit and whether it's a great technology and great people. And so we continue to look and we stay very active in the M&amp;A market.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Nancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Thank you, Simona. Can we have the next question, please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">From Piper Jaffray, we'll hear from Gene Munster.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eugene Charles Munster - Piper Jaffray &amp; Co (Broker)</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Good afternoon. Tim, could you talk a little bit about the iPhone ASP trends? And specifically, you mentioned that the iPhone SE is going to impact it. But how are you thinking about the aspirational market share that's out there and your actual market share and using price to close that gap? Is it just the iPhone SE, or could there be other iPhone models that will be discounted to try to be more aggressive in emerging markets?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And one for Luca, can you talk a little bit about the Services segment in terms of what piece of the services is driving growth, and maybe a little bit about the profitability on a net basis versus a gross basis that you've referred to in the past? Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Gene, I think the iPhone SE is attracting two types of customers. One is customers that wanted the latest technology but wanted it in a more compact package, and we clearly see even more people than we thought in that category. And then secondly, it's attracting people who aspire to own an iPhone but couldn't quite stretch to the entry price of the iPhone, and we've established a new entry. And so I think both of these markets are very, very important to us, and we're really excited about where it can take us. I do think that we will be really happy with the new-to-iPhone customers that we see from here because of the early returns we've had. We are currently supply constrained, but we'll be able to work our way out of this at some point. But it's great to see the overwhelming demand for it. I'll let Luca comment on the ASPs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Luca Maestri - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Senior Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So on the ASPs, Gene, we mentioned that we're going to be down sequentially. And this is really the combination of two factors when we go from the March quarter to the June quarter. It's the fact that we are having the iPhone SE entering the mix, and that obviously is going to have a downward pressure on ASP. And also this channel inventory reduction that we've talked about, obviously the channel inventory reduction will come from higher-end models, and that is also affecting the sequential trend on ASPs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">The question on Services, when we look at our Services business, it's obviously growing very well across the board. The biggest element and the part of the Services business that is growing very well, we mentioned 35%, is the App Store. It's interesting for us that our Music business, which had been declining for a number of quarters, now that we have both a download model and a streaming model, we have now hit an inflection point. And we really believe that this will be the bottom and we can start growing from there over time. We have many other Services businesses that are doing very well. We have an iCloud business that is growing very quickly, faster than the App Store from a much lower base, but I think it's important for us as we continue to develop these businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Tim has talked about Apple Pay. It doesn't provide a meaningful financial contribution at this point, but as we look at the amount of transactions that are going through Apple Pay right now and we think ahead for the long term, that could be an interesting business for us as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">From a profitability standpoint, we had mentioned last time that when you look at it on a gross basis, so in terms of purchase value of these services, the profitability of the business is similar to company average. Of course, when you net out the amount that is paid to developers and you look at it in terms of what is reported in our P&amp;L, obviously that business has a profitability that is higher than company average. We don't get into the specifics of specific products or services, but it's very clear it's significantly higher than company average.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eugene Charles Munster - Piper Jaffray &amp; Co (Broker)</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Nancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thanks, Gene. Can we have the next question, please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yes, thank you. First for Luca, this is the worst gross margin guide in a year and a half or so. And over the last couple of quarters, you've talked about a number of tailwinds, including component cost, the lower accounting deferrals that went into effect in September. You just mentioned the Services margins are above corporate average. So the question is, are some of those tailwinds winding down, or is the significant guide down in gross margins for the June quarter entirely related to volume and the iPhone 5 SE? And then I have a follow-up for Tim.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Luca Maestri - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Senior Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Katy, clearly the commodity environment remains quite favorable, and we continue to expect cost improvements. The other dynamics that you've mentioned are still there. Obviously, what is different and particularly as we look at it on a sequential basis coming out of the March quarter, we will have lots of leverage, and that obviously is going to have a negative impact on margins.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And the other factor that's important to keep in mind is this different mix of products. And particularly when you look at iPhone, what I was mentioning to Gene earlier, I think we've got a couple of things that are affecting not only ASPs, but obviously they also affect margins. And it's the fact that we had a channel inventory reduction at the top end of the range, and we've got the introduction of the iPhone SE at the entry level of the range. And so when you take into account those factors, those are the big elements that drive our guidance range right now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay, thank you, and then a question for Tim. I appreciate the optimism around longer-term iPhone unit growth, but with developed market penetration in the \u2013 anywhere from 60% to 80%, the growth is going to have to come from new markets. You've talked about India. Can you just spend a little bit more time on that market? What are some of the hurdles you have to overcome for that to be a larger part of the business? When should we expect Apple to have more distribution and specifically your own stores in that country? Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Katy, in the short term, let me just make a couple of comments on the developed markets just to make sure this is clear. If you look at our installed base of iPhone today versus two years ago, it's increased by 80%. And so when you think about upgrade cycles, upgrade cycles would have varying rates on it. As I talked about it in the comments, the iPhone 6s upgrade rate is slightly higher than the iPhone 5s but lower than the iPhone 6. But the other multiplier in that equation is obviously the size of the installed base. And so the nut of the idea is that I think there's still really, really good business in the developed markets, so I wouldn't want to write those off. And it's our jobs to come up with great products that people desire, and also to continue to attract over Android switchers. With our worldwide share, there's still quite a bit of room in the developed markets as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And from an India point of view, if you look at India, and each country has a different story a bit, but the things that have held not only us back perhaps but some others as well is that the LTE rollout with India just really began this year, and so we'll begin to see some really good networks coming on in India. That will unleash the power and capability of the iPhone in a way that an older network, a 2.5G or even some 3G networks, would not do. And so the infrastructure is one key. The second one is building the channel out. Unlike the U.S., as an example, where the carriers in the U.S. sell the vast majority of phones that are sold in the United States, in India the carriers in general sell virtually no phones. And so it's out in retail, and retail is many, many different small shops.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And so we've been in the process \u2013 it's not something that we just started in the last few weeks. We've been working in India now for a couple of years or more, but we've been working with great energy over the last 18 months or so, and I'm encouraged by the results that we're beginning to see there, and believe there's a lot, lot more there. It is already the third largest smartphone market in the world. But because the smartphones that are working there are low end, primarily because of the network and the economics, the market potential has not been as great there. But I view India as where China was maybe seven to ten years ago from that point of view, and I think there's a really great opportunity there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Nancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Thank you, Katy. Can we have the next question, please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We'll go to Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">A.M. Sacconaghi, Jr. - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes, thank you. I have one and then a follow-up as well. My sense is that you talked about adjusting for the changes in channel inventory, that you're guiding for relatively normal sequential growth. And I think if you do the math, it's probably the same or perhaps a touch worse in terms of iPhone unit growth sequentially relative to normal seasonality between fiscal Q2 and Q3. I guess the question is, given that you should be entering new markets and you should see pronounced elasticity from the iPhone SE device, why wouldn't we be seeing something that was dramatically above normal seasonal in terms of iPhone revenues and units for this quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Maybe you could push back on me, but I can't help thinking that when Apple introduced the iPad mini in a similar move to move down-market, there was great growth for one quarter, and the iPad never grew again, and margins and ASPs went down. And it looks like you're introducing the SE, and at least on a sequential basis, you're not calling for any uplift even adjusting for channel inventory. And ASPs I presume will go down and certainly it's impacting gross margins, as you've guided to. So could you respond to, A), why you're not seeing the elasticity? And, B), is the analogy with the iPad mini completely misplaced?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Toni, it's Tim. Let me see if I can address your question. The channel inventory reduction that Luca referred to, the vast, vast majority of that is in iPhone, and so that would affect the unit compare that you may be thinking about. The iPhone SE, we are thrilled with the response that we've seen on it. It is clear that there is a demand there even much beyond what we thought. And so that is really why we have the constraint that we have.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And so do I think it will be like the iPad mini? No, I don't think so. I don't see that. I think that the tablet market in general, one of the challenges with the tablet market is that the replacement cycle is materially different than in the smartphone market. And so as you probably know, we haven't had an issue in customer satisfaction on the iPad. It's incredibly high. And we haven't had an issue with usage of the iPad. The usage is incredibly high. But the consumer behavior there is you tend to hold on for a very long period of time before an upgrade.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We continue to be very optimistic on the iPad business. And as I had said in my remarks, we believe we're going to have the best compare for iPad revenue this quarter that we have had in quite some time. And so we'll report back in July on that one. But I think iPhone has a particularly different kind of cycle to it than the tablet market.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">A.M. Sacconaghi, Jr. - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. And if I can follow up, Tim, you alluded to replacement cycles and differences between the iPad and the iPhone. My sense was when you were going through the iPhone 6 cycle was that you had commented that the upgrade cycle was not materially different. I think your characterization was that it accelerated a bit in the U.S. but international had grown to be a bigger part of your business, and replacement cycles there were typically a little bit longer. And so I'm wondering. If there was only a modest difference between the iPhone 5s and the iPhone 6, how big a difference are we really seeing in terms of replacement cycles across the last three generations? And maybe you can help us. If the replacement cycle was flat this year relative to what you saw last year, how different would your results have been this quarter and the first half?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">There's a lot there. Let me just say I don't recall saying the things that you said I said about the upgrade cycle. Let me get that out of the way. Now let me describe without the specific numbers. The iPhone 6s upgrade cycle that we've measured for the first half of this year, so the first six months of our fiscal year to be precise, is slightly better than the rate that we saw with the iPhone 5s two years ago, but it's lower than the iPhone 6. I don't mean just a hair lower. It's a lot lower. And so without giving you exact numbers, if we would have the same rate on iPhone 6s that we did iPhone 6, it would be time for a huge party. It would be a huge difference.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Now the good news is \u2013 the great news from my point of view is I think we're strategically positioned very well because we've announced the iPhone SE. We are attracting customers that we previously didn't attract. That's really great. And this tough compare eventually isn't the benchmark. And the installed base is up 80% over the last two years. And so all of those I think bode well. And the switcher comments I made earlier, I wouldn't underestimate that because that's very important for us in every geography. So thanks for the question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">A.M. Sacconaghi, Jr. - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Nancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thanks, Toni. Can we have the next question, please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">From Cross Research Group, we'll hear from Shannon Cross.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thank you very much. I have a couple questions. One, Tim, can you talk a bit about what's going on in China? I know the Greater China revenue I think was down 26%. You did talk about Mainland China. But just if you could, talk about some of the trends you're seeing there and how you think it's playing out, and maybe your thoughts on iPhone SE adoption within China as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Shannon, thanks for the question. If you take Greater China, we include Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Mainland China in the Greater China segment that you see reported on your data sheet. The vast majority of the weakness in the Greater China region sits in Hong Kong. And our perspective on that is it's a combination of the Hong Kong dollar being pegged to the U.S. dollar, and therefore it carries the burden of the strength of the U.S. dollar. And that has driven tourism, international shopping, and trading down significantly compared to what it was in the year ago.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">If you look at Mainland China, which is one that I am personally very focused on, we are down 11% in Mainland China on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, we're only down 7%. And the way that we really look at the health or underlying demand is look at sell-through. And if you look at it there, we were down 5%. And keep in mind that that's down 5% on a comp a year ago that was up 81%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And so as I back up from this and look at the larger picture, I think China is not weak as has been talked about. I see China as may not have the wind at our backs that we once did, but it's a lot more stable than what I think is the common view of it. And so we remain really optimistic on China. We opened seven stores there during the quarter. We now are at 35. We'll open five more this quarter to achieve 40, which we had talked about before. And the LTE adoption continues to rise there, but it's got a long way ahead of it. And so we continue to be really optimistic about it and just would ask folks to look underneath the numbers at the details of them before concluding anything. Thanks for the question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay, thanks. And then my second question is with regard to OpEx leverage or thinking about when I look at the revenue, your revenue is below our expectations, but OpEx is pretty much in line. So how are you thinking about potential for leverage, I don't know, cost containment maybe when macro is bad and revenue is under pressure? And how are you juggling that versus the required investment you need to go forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Luca Maestri - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Senior Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Shannon, it's Luca. Of course we think about it. We think about it a lot. And so when you look at our results, for example, our OpEx for the quarter, for the March quarter was up 10%, which is the lowest rate that you've seen in years. And when you look within OpEx, you actually see two different dynamics. You see continued significant investments in research and development because we really believe that's the future of the company. We continue to invest in initiatives and projects ahead of revenue. We have a much broader portfolio than we used to have. We do much more in-house technology development than we used to do a few years ago, which we think is a great investment for us to make. And so that part we really need to protect and we want to continue to invest in the business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And then when you look at our SG&amp;A portion of OpEx for the March quarter, it was actually down slightly. So obviously, we think about it, and of course we look at our revenue trend and we take measures accordingly. And when you look at the guidance that we provided for the June quarter, that 10% year-over-year increase that I mentioned to you for the March quarter goes down to a range of 7% to 9% up. And again, the focus is on making investments in R&amp;D and continuing to run SG&amp;A extremely tightly and in a very disciplined way. As you know, our E-to-R, expense-to-revenue ratio, is around 10%. It's something that we're very proud of. It's a number that is incredibly competitive in our industry, and we want to continue to keep it that way. At the same time, we don't want to underinvest in the business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Nancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Than you, Shannon. Could we have the next question, please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">From UBS, we'll hear from Steve Milunovich.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Thank you. Tim, I first wanted to ask you about Services, and how do you view Services? You've obviously highlighted it the last two quarters. Do you view it going forward as a primary driver of earnings, or do you view it \u2013 you mentioned platforms in terms of your operating systems, which I would agree with. And in that scenario, I would argue it's more a supporter of the ecosystem and a supporter of the hardware margins over time and therefore somewhat subservient to hardware. So it's great that it's growing, but longer term, I would view its role as more creating ecosystem that supports the high margins on hardware as opposed to independently driving earnings. How do you think about it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">The most important thing for us, Steve, is that we want to have a great customer experience. So overwhelmingly, the thing that drives us are to embark on services that help that and become a part of the ecosystem. The reality is that in doing so, we have developed a very large and profitable business in the Services area. And so we felt last quarter and working up to that that we should pull back the curtain so that people could \u2013 our investors could see the Services business both in terms of the scale of it and the growth of it. As we said earlier, the purchase value of the installed base services grew by 27% during the quarter, which was an acceleration over the previous quarter. And the value of it hit just \u2013 or was just shy of $10 billion. And so it's huge, and we felt it was important to spell that out.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. And then going back to the upgrades of the installed base, you clearly mentioned that you've pulled forward some demand, which makes sense. But there does seem to be a lengthening of the upgrade cycle, particularly in the U.S. AT&amp;T and Verizon have talked about that. Investors I think perceive that maybe the marginal improvements on the phone might be less currently and could be less going forward. At the same time, I think you just announced that you can get the upgrade program online, which I guess potentially could shorten it. Do you believe that upgrade cycles are currently lengthening and can continue to do so?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">What we've seen is that it depends on what you compare it to. If you compare to the iPhone 5s, what we're seeing is the upgrade rate today is slightly higher or that there are more people upgrading, if you will, in a similar time period in terms of rate than the iPhone 5s. But if you compare to iPhone 6, you would clearly arrive at the opposite conclusion. And so I think it depends on people's reference points. And we thought it very important in this call to be very clear and transparent about what we are seeing. And so I think in retrospect, you can look at it and say, well maybe the appropriate measure is more to the iPhone 5s, and I think everybody intuitively thought that the upgrades were accelerated with the iPhone 6. In retrospect, when you look at the periods, they clearly were.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Nancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Thanks, Steve. Can we have the next question, please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">We'll go to Rod Hall with JPMorgan.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Thanks, guys, for fitting me in. I wanted to start with a more general question. I guess. Tim, this one is aimed at you. As you think about where you thought things were going to head last quarter when you reported to us and how it's changed this quarter, obviously this kind of a disappointing demand environment. Can you just help us understand what maybe the top two or three things are that have changed, so as we walk away from this we understand what the differences are and what the direction of change is? And I've got a follow up.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I think, Rod, you're probably indirectly asking about our trough comment, if you will, from last quarter. And when we made that, we did not contemplate or comprehend that we were going to make a $2 billion-plus reduction in channel inventory during this quarter. And so if you factor that in and look at true customer demand, which is the way that we look at it internally, I think you'll find a much more reasonable comparison.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay, great. Thank you. And then for my follow-up, I wanted to ask you about the tax situation a little bit. Treasury obviously has made some rule changes, and I wonder maybe if, Luca, you could comment on what the impact to Apple from those is, if anything; and, Tim, maybe more broadly, how you guys see the tax situation for Apple looking forward? Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Luca Maestri - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Senior Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yes. Rod, these are new regulations. We are in the process of assessing them. Frankly, from first read, we don't anticipate that they're going to have any material impact on our tax situation. Some of them relate to inversion transactions, so obviously that's not an issue for us. Some of them are around internal debt financing, which is not something that we use, so we don't expect any issue there. As you know, we are the largest U.S. taxpayer by a wide margin, and we already pay full U.S. tax on all the profits from the sales that we make in the United States. So we don't expect them to have any impact on us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">On tax reform, maybe I can continue, and I'll let Tim provide more color, but we've been strong advocates for comprehensive corporate tax reform in this country. We continue to do that. We think a reform of the tax code would have significant benefits for the entire U.S. economy, and we remain optimistic that we're going to get to a point where we can see that tax reform enacted. At that point in time, of course, we would have much more flexibility around optimizing our capital structure and around providing more return of capital to our investors.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">The only thing I would add, Rod, is I think there are a growing number of people in both parties that would like to see comprehensive reform, and so I'm optimistic that it will occur. It's just a matter of when. And that's difficult to say, but I think most people do recognize that it's in the U.S.'s interest to do this.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Great. Thanks, guys.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Nancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Thank you, Rod.

Today's call is being recorded.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Nancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you, good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple CEO Tim Cook, and he'll be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. And after that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding revenues, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, and future business outlook. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2015, the Forms 10-Q for the first two quarters of fiscal 2016, and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">In addition, today's comments will refer to a metric we describe as installed base related purchases. This is a non-GAAP measure, and a reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measure can be found on our Investor Relations website at Apple.com/investor.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Timothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Today we're pleased to report third quarter results that reflect stronger customer demand and business performance than we anticipated just 90 days ago and include several encouraging signs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Revenue of $42.4 billion was near the high end of our guidance range and gross margin of 38% was at the top of our guidance range. We achieved these results while reducing channel inventory by about $3.6 billion, significantly more than the $2 billion inventory reduction we had expected. So our sell-through was markedly greater than our sell-in.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">iPhone accounted for the vast majority of the channel inventory reduction. iPhone unit sell-through was down just 8% year on year, an even greater improvement over the March quarter than we predicted, and we expect the September quarter sell-through comparison to improve further. We feel good about our channel inventory levels and believe they position us well for the months ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We had a very successful global launch of iPhone SE, and demand outstripped supply throughout the quarter. We brought on additional capacity and were able to achieve supply/demand balance as we entered the September quarter. At its launch, we said that the addition of the iPhone SE to the iPhone lineup placed us in a better position to meet the needs of customers who love a four-inch phone and to attract even more customers into our ecosystem.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">In both cases, that strategy is working. Our initial sales data tells us that the iPhone SE is popular in both developed and emerging markets, and the percentage of iPhone SE sales going to customers who are new to iPhone is greater than we've seen in the first weeks of availability for other iPhones launched in the last several years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Overall, we added millions of first-time smartphone buyers in the June quarter, and switchers accounted for the highest percentage of quarterly iPhone sales we've ever measured. In absolute terms, our year-to-date iPhone sales to switchers are the greatest we've seen in any nine-month period, and our active installed base of iPhones is up strong double-digits year over year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We saw tremendous performance from our Services businesses, which grew 19% to a June quarter record of $6 billion. The growth was broad-based, with App Store revenue up 37% to a new all-time high, in addition to strong increases in Music, iCloud, and AppleCare. In the last 12 months, our Services revenue is up almost $4 billion year on year to $23.1 billion, and we expect it to be the size of a Fortune 100 company next year. Most of our terrific Services performance during the quarter was fueled by our active installed base of devices, with installed base-related purchases of $10.3 billion accelerating to 29% growth year on year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We had our best iPad compare in 10 quarters, with revenue growing 7% thanks to the rollout of the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. We're proud to have the most exciting lineup of tablets and accessories in the world and exceptionally high customer satisfaction and engagement. Our surveys also show that about half of iPad Pro purchases are buying them for work. iPad Pro is the ultimate upgrade for existing iPad users and the ultimate replacement device for customers switching from PC notebooks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Apple Watch continues to be the best-selling smartwatch in the world. And just this month, J.D. Power ranked it highest in customer satisfaction among all smartwatches. With watchOS 3 coming this fall, customers will be able to update their Apple Watches with an enhanced user interface, significantly improved performance and all-new fitness and health capabilities, including activity sharing. We're just getting started with the Apple Watch, and we look forward to even more exciting announcements in this space.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">On a personal note, during the past quarter I visited China and India, and I am very encouraged about our growth prospects in those countries. We remain very optimistic about the long-term opportunities in Greater China and we continue to invest there. We opened our 41st Greater China retail store during the quarter, and we also made a $1 billion investment in Didi Chuxing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Switchers and first-time smartphone buyers represented the lion's share of our iPhone sales in the quarter, and our installed base of iPhones in China has grown by 34% over the last year alone. According to China Mobile, there are more iPhones on their network than any other brand, with iPhone users ranking first in terms of customer loyalty, data usage and ARPU. By far, the largest portion of our global channel inventory reduction was in Greater China, so our underlying business there is stronger than our results imply.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We face some challenges in Greater China, as the economic environment has slowed down since the beginning of the year. This is reflected in consumer confidence and retail spending, and the Chinese yuan has depreciated by 7% relative to the U.S. dollar since August of last year. Hong Kong's tourism and retail businesses also continue to be significantly impacted by the stronger Hong Kong dollar relative to other Asian currencies.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Combining this backdrop with the tough comparison to last year, when revenue grew 112%, and the channel inventory reduction this year, we're reporting a decline in revenue in the June quarter. But to keep things in perspective, when we look back on our accomplishments in this segment over the last couple of years, they are truly remarkable. In the first three quarters of this fiscal year, our total revenue from Greater China was almost $40 billion, up 55% from the same timeframe just two years ago, while iPhone units were up 47%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">India is now one of our fastest growing markets. In the first three quarters of this fiscal year, our iPhone sales in India were up 51% year on year. We just announced a first of its kind design and development accelerator to support Indian developers creating innovative applications for iOS, and we opened a new office in Hyderabad to accelerate maps development. We're looking forward to opening retail stores in India down the road, and we see huge potential for that vibrant country.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">As we look forward to the fall, we are thrilled by customers' response to the software and services we previewed at our Worldwide Developers Conference last month. This was our biggest WWDC ever. And for the first time, we have four innovative Apple platforms for our developers' apps, iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. In fact, iOS 10 will be the biggest release ever for iOS.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">The momentum of all four platforms shows the strong relationship Apple enjoys with customers throughout their day and wherever they go, whether it's at home, in their car, at work, or everywhere in between. The Apple ecosystem is thriving and growing, and our new OS releases this fall will take these great experiences to a new level.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Customers can look forward to more expressive ways to communicate with messages now with its own App Store, allowing users to create and share content, make payments, add stickers and more, all without leaving messages, which is now one of the largest messaging services in the world. Customers can also look forward to a broader and more intelligent role for Siri, which will work with your favorite apps from the App Store, so you can ask Siri to book a ride with your favorite ride sharing app or send money to someone with Square.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">There are also beautifully redesigned apps for music, maps and news, significant enhancements to HomeKit, CarPlay, and the Health app, building on our strategy to give users a seamless experience in all aspects of their lives. There's also a major update with macOS Sierra, with new features like Siri and Apple Pay that make the Mac smarter and more helpful than ever, and even stronger continuity features across all the Apple devices.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">These experiences become more powerful and intuitive as we continue our long history of enriching our products through advanced artificial intelligence. We have focused our AI efforts on the features that best enhance the customer experience. For example, machine learning enables Siri to understand words as well as the intent behind them. That means Siri does a better job understanding and even predicting what you want, then delivering the right responses to requests. To make Siri an even smarter assistant, we're opening the service to developers, and this fall Siri will be available across our entire product line.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We're also using machine learning in many other ways across our products and services, including recommending songs, apps, and news. Machine learning is improving facial and image recognition in photos, predicting word choice while typing in messages and mail, and providing context awareness in maps for better directions. Deep learning within our products even enables them to recognize usage patterns and improve their own battery life. And most importantly, we deliver these intelligent services while protecting users' privacy. Most of the AI processing takes place on the device rather than being sent to the cloud. And starting this fall, we'll be using sophisticated technology called differential privacy, enhancing our ability to deliver the kinds of services we dream of and customers love without compromising on the individual privacy our customers have come to expect from us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">This fall we'll also bring Apple Pay to Safari so users can easily make secure and private purchases when shopping on participating websites. Tens of millions of users around the world are enjoying Apple Pay today at stores and in app, with estimated monthly active users up more than 450% year on year last month.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Leading financial partners tell us that three out of four contactless payments in the U.S. are made with Apple Pay. This is amazing. There are more than 11 million contactless-ready locations in the countries where Apple Pay is available today, including 3 million locations now accepting Apple Pay in the United States. With the launch of France, Switzerland, and Hong Kong this month, Apple Pay is now live in nine markets, including six of our top 10. Adoption outside the U.S. has been explosive, with over half of transaction volume now coming from non-U.S. markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">With our latest OS releases, the unparalleled continuity across Apple devices will become even more powerful. For example, macOS Sierra will sense other devices and use secure protocols to communicate. With an authenticated Apple Watch, I can auto-unlock my Mac when I open it without typing a password. With Universal Clipboard, I can copy and paste text, images, and even video between my iOS devices and my Mac. And I can automatically access the files on my Mac desktop and documents folder from another Mac, iOS device, or even a PC.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Innovations like these are the kinds of things that only Apple can do. We have an incredible lineup of products in our pipeline, and I'm very bullish about our long-term opportunity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Now I'd like to hand it over to Luca to share more details with you on the June quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Luca Maestri - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Senior Vice President</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the June quarter was $42.4 billion, near the high end of our guidance range, compared to $49.6 billion in the year-ago quarter. Customer demand for our products and services was stronger than we had anticipated at the beginning of the quarter. As Tim mentioned, we reduced overall channel inventories by roughly $3.6 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On a geographic basis, our revenue grew strongly in Japan to a new June quarter record, and we experienced healthy growth in a number of other important markets, including Russia, Brazil, Turkey, India, and Canada.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Gross margin was 38%, at the top of our guidance range. Operating margin was 23.9% of revenue, and net income was $7.8 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.42, and cash flow from operations was strong at $10.6 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">For details by product, I will start with the iPhone. We sold 40.4 million iPhones in the quarter. We also reduced channel inventory by over 4 million units compared to about 0.5 million units a year ago, so sell-through was down by 8%. We exited the quarter near the low end of our five-week to seven-week target range for channel inventory. The rollout of our new entry-level iPhone SE concurrent with the channel reduction of more than 4 million higher-end iPhones resulted in a lower than usual iPhone ASP of $595. Therefore, we expect ASPs to improve this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets, with sales in Russia more than doubling year over year, and double-digit growth in many other key countries, including Japan, Turkey, Brazil, India, Canada, and Sweden.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">iPhone continues to show great momentum in business markets. A recent survey by 451 Research found that among U.S. corporate buyers planning to purchase smartphones in the September quarter, 75% plan to purchase iPhones. This is the highest corporate purchase intent ever measured by the survey for the September quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to Services, we generated $6 billion in revenue, an increase of 19% over the June quarter last year. We set a new record for customers transacting on our iTunes Stores. And among our customers who purchase apps and content, the average amount spent per customer was the highest that we've ever measured. The App Store's growth rate has now accelerated for four consecutive quarters, reaching 37% in Q3. The App Store is overwhelmingly the preferred destination for both customers and developers. According to App Annie, we generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the June quarter, widening our lead from the March</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Because of this continued growth, for the first nine months of our fiscal year, Services increased from 8% of our total revenue a year ago to 11% this year, and it represents an even higher percentage of our profitability.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Next I'd like to talk about the Mac. We sold 4.3 million Macs compared to 4.8 million last year. It was a challenging quarter for personal computer sales across the industry, with IDC estimating a 4% global contraction. In addition to the overall market slowdown, we faced a very difficult compare to the year-ago quarter, when we introduced a new MacBook Pro and a new iMac. Despite these challenges, Mac continues to gain a high percentage of new customers, and our Mac installed base has grown to a new all-time high at the end of the June quarter. We ended the quarter below our four-week to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Now turning to iPad, revenue grew 7%. iPad ASP was $490 compared to $415 in the year-ago quarter, with the increase driven by iPad Pro, and we sold 10 million iPads compared to 10.9 million in the year-ago quarter. We also reduced channel inventory by about 500,000 units and exited the quarter within our five-week to seven-week target range.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">In the segments of the tablet market where we compete, we continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics. Recent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the overall U.S. tablet market in the June quarter and has 84% share of tablets priced above $200. And in May, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini and a 95% rate for iPad Air. Among U.S. consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 63% plan to purchase an iPad, almost four times the purchase intention rate of the next highest brand measured, with iPad Pro the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers report a 94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 71% for the September quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">One recent example of iPad business adoption is Sberbank, Russia's largest bank, which is adding 22,000 iPads to more than 10,000 purchased last year to deploy corporate mobility solutions across the organization and enable its consultants to serve customers in a more engaging and more efficient way.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">More broadly, we're making great progress with our enterprise initiatives and we see strong growth opportunities ahead of us. In May, we announced a global strategic partnership with SAP to reimagine business processes with native iOS apps. SAP is the world's largest enterprise software provider, with more than 130 million potential users among its 300,000 global customers. In fact, it's estimated that 76% of global business transactions touch an SAP system. Our partnership will deliver an SDK to fast-track iOS projects for SAP environments, an iOS academy to enable the 2.5 million SAP developers around the world to build great native iOS apps, and a portfolio of industry-specific apps to accelerate mobile transformation in the enterprise.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Last month, we announced the first three solutions from our Cisco partnership, two that will dramatically improve the network performance of iOS traffic running on Cisco networks, and one that will bring the desk phone to the 21st century by integrating iPhone Wi-Fi calling into Cisco Spark.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $231.5 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential decrease of $1.4 billion. $214.8 billion of this cash, or 93% of the total, was outside the United States.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We issued a total $2.4 billion of debt in Taiwan and in Australia, while retiring $2.5 billion in U.S. debt, leaving us with $72 billion in term debt at the end of the quarter, essentially unchanged from last quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We returned a total of over $13 billion to investors during the June quarter as follows. We paid $3.2 billion in dividends and equivalent. We spent $4 billion on repurchases of 41.2 million Apple shares through open-market transactions. And we launched a new $6 billion ASR, resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 48.2 million shares.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We also completed our sixth accelerated share repurchase program, retiring an additional 8.7 million shares. We've now completed almost $177 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program, including $127 billion in share repurchases. During the quarter, we also spent $1 billion on a minority investment in Didi Chuxing in China, completed three acquisitions and incurred $4.2 billion in capital expenditures.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $45.5 billion and $47.5 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 37.5% and 38%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.050 billion and $6.150 billion. We expect OI&amp;E to be about $350 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 25.5%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Also today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock, payable on August 11, 2016 to shareholders of record as of August 8, 2016.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Nancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Thank you, Luca. And we ask that you limit yourself to one one-part question and one follow-up. Operator, may we have the first question, please?</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p6\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Your first question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Thank you very much for the question. Tim, can you talk a little bit about your thoughts on investments? You made the Didi investment this quarter. Obviously, you continue to make acquisitions over time. We just saw I guess you invested in buying some of Carpool Karaoke. I'm just curious as to how you're thinking about where you're putting your investment dollars for more of an acquisition or a potential equity stake standpoint as you look at overall capital allocation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Shannon, we obviously invest a ton of capital in our business itself to support research and development and the production of our products. And that's the main source of our capital. However, we're constantly looking on the outside for great talent and great intellectual property. And we have been buying companies on average every three to four weeks or so, and we continue to do that. And we think we've made some really great choices there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">In terms of the investment in Didi, it was an unusual investment in that, as you know, we don't have a long history of doing a lot of these, but we have done some before. We invested in ARM in the early days. We invested in Akamai and a few other companies. So it wasn't the first.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">From a Didi point of view, we see that as, one, a great financial investment. Two, we think that there are some strategic things that the companies can do together over time. And three, we think that we'll learn a lot about the business and the Chinese market even beyond what we currently know, and Didi has an incredible team there. And so that's the rationale for why we did that. Would we do more investments? Yes, but it's not something that you'll see a whole string of from us. But we will constantly look for things that are smart to do.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Great. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up for Luca. If you could, talk a little bit about the gross margin puts and takes for guidance, 37% to 38%. How are you thinking about commodity pricing and mix of the new products and that just as you look to how you guided gross margin?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Luca Maestri - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Senior Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Yes, Shannon. Let me correct you. It's 37.5% to 38%...</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Sorry. I had that written down, but I said the wrong thing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Luca Maestri - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Senior Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">...for the September quarter. So essentially, we're guiding GM flat to slightly down sequentially. On the positive side, we're going to have leverage because we are guiding to a sequential increase in revenue, and we expect to have positive mix as we get into the September quarter, and these positives being offset more or less by what we call product transition costs, which are typical at this time of the year for us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Great. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Shannon, on the commodity side and for the September quarter, we see NAND being pretty much in balance while DRAM and LCDs and other major commodities remain in an oversupply situation. And so overall commodity prices we expect to decline at at-least historical rates.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Nancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Thank you, Shannon. Could we have the next question, please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">From UBS, we'll hear from Steve Milunovich.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Great, thank you very much. Regarding your revenue guidance for September, it's up about 10% sequentially, which is clearly at the high end historically. So what can you tell us about the timing of the new iPhone model? Is that affecting this? You mentioned that 451 Research is finding business interest in phones, but their survey on consumers actually finds the lowest level of expectation for purchases in the next three months since 2008. You've seen the upgrade numbers from the carriers are quite low. So it seems like it's still a very tough demand environment. So where is the strength coming from in the September quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Steve, we're not going to get into products or product transition. However, we've taken what we've learned from last quarter, and we did see a number of encouraging signs. Luca talked about the number of countries that we saw double-digit growth in during the quarter, from Japan to Brazil to India, some even stronger numbers than that in Russia. So there's a number of countries that we saw strong signals from that perspective.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">We also are very happy with the switcher rate that we saw, our highest ever recorded. And the number of switchers through the nine months are the highest absolute numbers that we've ever had. And so when we look at that and then we look at the things going on, on our other products and services, and we think Services will continue to grow very briskly. We've made our best estimate of where we think we'll come in, and that's $45.5 billion to $47.5 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay, fair enough. And as a follow-up, I wanted to ask you about your platform strategy. You talk about the four operating systems essentially as platforms, which I agree with. And it's just interesting to me because Apple has such a control over the vertical integration of your products, and yet you've somehow been able to grasp the openness that's required for platforms. And I think that's reflected in WWDC, as you pointed out, opening up APIs and so forth on messaging.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And you made the case there for apps versus messaging and the anti-bot argument. I'm just curious. Is that the way \u2013 am I characterizing this roughly correctly in terms about how you think about the business? And how are you managing that internally in terms of having this vertically integrated somewhat closed view of the hardware and yet this pretty open platform where the value is created externally?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">We think to have a great platform you have to have a really healthy ecosystem. And so we're really proud of the developer community and the fact that developers are earning a lot more money in writing for iOS than other apps. We think that the best experience for users include apps, and so we want to do everything that we can do to continue building that. We now have over 2 million apps in the App Store and are more focused these days on discovery and other things to bring more great apps to the service because there are so many out there. And so that's what we're doing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">The TV, and you didn't mention CarPlay, but these are trying to provide our users a seamless experience across all the different things that they do in their lives. And so that's the rationale for CarPlay. It's the rationale for why we're putting a huge investment in the home, making \u2013 really bringing home automation to life for people in a very simple and elegant way. It's the reason for Apple TV and what we're doing in the living room. And so all these things, all these things together are all about the user experience and making people's daily lives better.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Nancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thank you, Steve. Could we have the next question please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">We'll go to Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thank you. Luca, as it relates to gross margin, the guidance today is very similar to what you've provided over the last five years in terms of gross margin guidance in September versus June. And the variances that you walked through in response to Shannon's questions are very similar to the dynamics that you see in any September quarter. But there's an added factor this time around, which is you don't have the 4 million units of high-ASP, high-margin inventory drain in September like you did in the June quarter. So I guess I'd just push back and ask why gross margin guidance wouldn't be even better? Is it the more balanced NAND environment that Tim spoke to, or is there something else impacting the guidance?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Luca Maestri - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Senior Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Katy, I've talked about these elements at a broad level. Of course, there are degrees of positive impact. We for example on the mix front, every cycle is slightly different on our product mix, and so that clearly has an impact on gross margins. And the other thing that we need to keep in mind as we step back for a second and now we've gone through a couple of cycles where the U.S. dollar has strengthened. And as you know, we work with our hedging program where we get protection from FX fluctuations in the short term. When these hedges roll off over time, we end up replacing them with new hedging contracts at spot rates.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And so versus September of 2014, for example, the U.S. dollar has now strengthened on average against international currencies by about 15%. And I think we need to accept that now we're living in this stronger U.S. dollar environment. We've taken a lot of actions on the cost side, on the pricing side, and obviously with hedges. But we need to deal with this situation, and that's where we are right now. We feel that 37.5% to 38% given the new FX environment I think says a lot about all the work that we've done on the cost side to get there. Just to give you a sense, on a year-over-year basis, when I look at foreign exchange, that has an impact of almost 300 basis points on our margins.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay, thank you. And, Tim, can you speak to how you envision the upgrade rate of the iPhone installed base to play out over the next quarter or the next year? Somebody mentioned that U.S. carriers have reported really weak upgrade rates, not necessarily for iPhone, but across their installed base. The press is discussing only modest technology upgrades in your next iPhone cycle. And so those data points would lead investors to believe that the upgrade rate will be low, but curious if you have a different view. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I don't want to talk about phones that aren't announced. And so that aside, what we have seen in the past tense or current tense on the upgrade rate is that the iPhone upgrade rate for the iPhone 6S is very similar to the iPhone 5S. And I guess in retrospect, maybe that was a predictable thing, although we didn't predict it in the beginning. It took us a little time to realize that. The iPhone 6 was significantly higher than that, and so it likely accelerated upgrades that would have been in the current year ahead of those. And so what the future holds, we'll see.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">But I'm very optimistic about the future because I see so many signs that are positive. I see an installed base that has gotten incredibly large. I see a switcher rate that is the highest ever. I see the smartphone itself, led by iPhone, becoming even more instrumental and important to people's lives. It's becoming essential. And all of the things that are coming both in the fall, the things that we've announced that you can see with iOS 10, hopefully you're running by now with the beta, those and other things make it even more instrumental. And AI even makes it even more and more. As the phone becomes more and more your assistant, it's one of those that you're not going to leave without it. And so I see all of those things as vectors that are incredibly positive.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I also really like what I've seen with the iPhone SE and the fact that it's opening the door to customers that we weren't reaching before and likely convincing some people to upgrade that wanted a smaller form factor but wanted to stay with iPhone, and so they were waiting for the iPhone SE. And so I see lots of positive things, and so that's how I look at it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Nancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thank you, Katy. Could we have the next question please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">We'll go to Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Toni Sacconaghi - Bernstein Research</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yes, thank you. You commented about the significant inventory drawdown in the quarter, $3.6 billion on the revenue side. So sell-through was $46 billion effectively, over 4 million iPhones, suggesting that sell-through iPhone sales were 45 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">When I look to your guidance for Q4, I actually have the opposite question of a previous question, which is in light of the true sell-through rate, which seems to reflect better than normal seasonality in Q3, likely some contribution and elasticity from the SE, when I look at Q4, it looks like you're guiding for iPhone unit on a sell-through basis to be flat or potentially down and for total company revenues to be only fractionally up and below the seasonality we see in Q4.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So I guess my question is, are you expecting any drawdowns in channel inventory in fiscal Q4? Are my inferences around sell-through rate incorrect? Or given the business momentum that you spoke about in response to an earlier question and the hopefulness that you expressed in your prepared remarks, Tim, I'm actually surprised that the guidance isn't a bit stronger on the top line.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Luca Maestri - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Senior Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Toni, let me take it. Starting with your comments on the June quarter, I just want to point out that when we talk about a $3.6 billion channel inventory reduction, that is not entirely related to iPhone. iPhone is the vast majority of that, but we did reduce channel inventory on all other products as well. So that probably leads you to different conclusions to the math that you have just expressed.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">On the September quarter, when I look at the sequential increase for iPhone units that we are expecting, I would say that it is, even with the sell-through adjustments that you've talked about, it's still pretty much in line with what we've seen in the past. As you know, we do not provide guidance for channel inventory. But I would say, in general, I think it's important to keep in mind that if we look around the world, we do see a lot of positive signs, but we also know that the macroeconomic environment is slowing down in a number of places around the world. And that needs to be taken into account in our guidance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Toni Sacconaghi - Bernstein Research</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. Luca, I did understand the $3.6 billion, but you said over 4 million iPhones were drawn down. I added that to the 40.4 million, so that would suggest close to 45 million on a sell-through basis. So that was the basis for my observation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I was wondering if I could direct one at Tim. You talked about the upgrade cycle and how it elongated relative to the iPhone 6 and that it's similar to what you saw with the iPhone 5S. And my belief is that one of the bigger longer-term concerns for Apple is that the replacement cycle could just structurally elongate over time, particularly as your installed base of customers becomes less affluent and more international.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So I guess my question is, you have a mechanism, which is the Apple Upgrade Program, which takes replacement cycle out of the equation and puts people on buying the phone as a service. And so I'd welcome any comments on how that program is doing. And then just more broadly, is Apple thinking about ways to sell not only the iPhone, but more of its products on a monthly type subscription basis, perhaps in a more bundled fashion so that you can add more predictability to what is now largely a transactional revenue model?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">The iPhone demand is made up, as you know, of upgraders, switchers and new to smartphone. And so if you take it in reverse order for a minute and look at a new smartphone, smartphone penetration right now around the world at the end of December was 42%. And so there's quite a bit of room there. It is true that a lot of those are in emerging markets, but we have done \u2013 we've had reasonable business success in several emerging markets. And so we don't enter into those with no experience, although we will enter into them humbly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">On the switcher side, we really like what we're seeing. And we think that from a user point of view, as the smartphone itself becomes more and more essential to people's daily lives, which is a part of what I had talked about before, a part of bringing it into the home in a bigger way and in the car and at work and so forth, we think people will put more and more focus on what they're buying and the thing that Apple does best, which is provide this killer experience. A killer user experience that's integrated across their lives I think becomes more important and I think that really plays to our advantage. I also think that the deployment of AI technology is something that we will excel at because of our focus on user experience, and so I like that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">From an upgrade point of view, there are pluses and minuses as I see it. A plus is that more and more people have already joined upgrade programs. Some of these programs, like the one that you referenced that we've done, replaces the iPhone every year. There are also carriers that have similar kind of plans, where they also replace or change out the iPhone every year. Others have an 18-month clock. Some have a 24-month clock, and there are even some that have a 30-month clock. And so there's various time schedules there. And so, as of today, there are obviously a lot more people on those programs than ever before because they just started. It really got underway in a big way last year, in a smaller way two years ago. And so we'll see more of those this coming fall.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">The minus side is that the bifurcation of the smartphone from the service itself has a plus and a minus into it. The subsidy, the lack of that \u2013 and this is more of a U.S. phenomenon than the rest of the world, some of that can be a shock for people that were used to paying $199 for their smartphone. They come back in and they pay less for the service but they pay more for their smartphone. And so there's lots of pluses and minuses on this. But overall, as I look at this for Apple, and this is not a statement on the industry itself, but for Apple, I'm very optimistic.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Nancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thank you, Toni. Could we have the next question, please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">From Goldman Sachs, Simona Jankowski.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thank you. Tim, as you mentioned, you traveled to China during the quarter. And while you certainly sound encouraged on China and highlighted the Didi investment, there are some of the key services for Apple like iBooks and iTunes Movies that are still banned, and some of the local vendors appear to be gaining share. So can you just give us your perspective on the market, your expectations around getting those services back up, and also regaining share?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes, for books and movies, we currently have those stores off, as you mentioned. To put this in some context, those two stores for the months that we had them operational, which was several months, the revenue was less than $1 million. And so it's not a revenue-related issue. From our point of view, this is a service we want to provide our customers. And so we're working very closely with the appropriate government agencies, and we hope to make books and movies available again to our customers there. And so we'll see how that goes, but we're optimistic there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And in terms of just regaining share in that market more broadly?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I think we've always had \u2013 if you look at our share over time, our share in China tends to peak during launch windows. There's a higher high and a lower low there. There's a bigger difference between those two. And so what we have to do and what we're doing is innovating like crazy and delivering the best smartphone to our customers there. And if we do a really great job of that, which we will, then I'm confident that we'll do well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Nancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thank you, Simona. Could we have the next question, please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray &amp; Co.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Good afternoon. Tim, you gave some nice data points around Apple Pay. Can you remind us? Is this a business that ultimately impacts the Services line in any measurable way, or is Apple Pay generally about selling iPhones?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And separately, when you just take a step back and look at the proof point that the augmented reality [AR] theme has had with this whole Pok\u00e9mon phenomenon, how does it impact how you think about the future? I assume you think about it. I'm just curious what goes on in your mind when you see all that. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">On the Apple Pay side, the revenues from Apple Pay are in the Services line. The growth is astronomical, but the base is very small. And so for today, Apple Pay is very much about a great feature for our customers so that they can pay in a very simple, private, and secure way.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">In terms of AR and the Pok\u00e9mon phenomenon, it's incredible what has happened there. I think it's a testament to what happens with innovative apps and the whole ecosystem and the power of being a developer being able to press a button, so to speak, and offer their product around the world. And just a certain developer has elected not to go worldwide yet because of the pressure on their servers, et cetera, because of the demand. But I'm sure that they will over time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">It also does show, as you point out, that AR can be really great. And we have been and continue to invest a lot in this. We are high on AR for the long run. We think there are great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity. And so we're investing, and the number one thing is to make sure our products work well with other developers' products like Pok\u00e9mon. And so that's the reason why you see so many iPhones out in the wild right now chasing Pok\u00e9mons.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray &amp; Co.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Would you say there's going to be a computing shift to AR longer term?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I notice there are people that want to call it a new computer platform, and we'll see. I think there's a tendency in this industry to call everything new the next computer platform. However, that said, I think AR can be huge. So we'll see whether it's the next platform. But regardless, it will be huge.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray &amp; Co.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Nancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Thanks, Gene. Can we have the next question, please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">We'll go to Mark Moskowitz with Barclays.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. I just want to follow up, Tim, if I could, related to the R&amp;D pace of growth, clearly a lot of momentum there over the last couple years. But we're just trying to figure out how much of that is dedicated to existing products and services versus what's next? Can you give us a sense in terms of when investors should think about the ROI coming back to them from the R&amp;D perspective? And a corollary to that, is it really restricted just to products and services currently, or can we see more of a cloud services apparatus evolve over time where you do more and more in the enterprise just given the core trips with SAP and Cisco and IBM?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And then my follow-up for Luca is around ASPs for the iPhone. We keep getting a lot of questions around iPhone SE in terms of how cannibalistic could it be to the core iPhone franchise. Are you seeing any moderation in terms of the ASP pressures here?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">On R&amp;D growth, we do continue to invest significantly in R&amp;D. The growth rates are still large on a year-over-year basis, and Luca can share the exact ones. But I think the recent quarter was in the mid-20% for R&amp;D. The balance of the company we're managing more flattish from a year-over-year point of view. The products that are in R&amp;D, there is quite a bit of investment in there for products and services that are not currently shipping or derivations of what is currently shipping. And so I don't want to talk about the exact split of it. But you can look at the growth rate and conclude that there's a lot of stuff that we're doing beyond the current products.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Luca Maestri - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Senior Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Mark, on the ASP question, I talked about the $595 in Q3. It's down $65 on a year-over-year basis. Keep in mind, about $20 of that $65 is foreign exchange. So during the quarter, we had this combination of starting with no iPhone SE units in channel inventory, so we had to do an at least a partial channel fill that obviously had an impact on ASPs. And then the other element was the fact that we've reduced more than 4 million units of channel inventory on the high end. So the combination of these two things obviously had an impact on ASPs. But I think as I said or Tim said during the prepared remarks, we do expect iPhone ASP to improve sequentially as we move into the September quarter because these two factors that I just mentioned are not going to repeat.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">On cannibalization, of course we've got limited experience because the phone has been in the market just for a few weeks. But when we look at our survey data on iPhone SE, as Tim was saying, we believe that the iPhone SE is doing exactly what it was intended, which is we are seeing a higher rate of new to iPhone customers, which is obviously very important to us because we bring new people into the iOS ecosystem. And we see a higher rate of previous iPhone owners that really prefer the four-inch form factor. We have not seen clear evidence of cannibalization from iPhone 6S or iPhone 6S Plus. Of course, there's always going to be some level of cannibalization. But really to us what is much more relevant is the much bigger opportunity to bring more people into the iOS ecosystem.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Nancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Thanks, Mark. Could we have the next question, please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">From Credit Suisse, we'll hear from Kulbinder Garcha.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) LLC (Broker)</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Thanks, just a couple questions for me. Luca, I just want to clarify that last point on ASPs on iPhone because last quarter it seemed that you were quite clear that that was a negative driver to the gross margin of the company. So I understand there are other drivers going into the September quarter. But just to be clear, the phone units you didn't sell through that were depleted in channel inventory, those are relatively high gross margin as well. That's the clarification.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And then for Tim, on the Services side, as Apple has spoken more and more loudly I guess in the last three or four quarters, I just think about some of the comments you've made about the TV market and how it's been stuck I think in the 1960s and the 1970s and the experience hasn't changed. I understand you've got the Apple TV box out. But in terms of driving actual video-on-demand services, is that something that Apple wants to do themselves? Do you want a partner? Could you even build content? How do you think about that as an actual business opportunity as opposed to here's an Apple box and we sell some units, but it's not that meaningful to the overall company in terms of size? I'm just curious given the installed base and users you have. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Luca Maestri - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Senior Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Kulbinder, on your question on iPhone ASP, I'm not sure if I understood it correctly. But clearly the iPhone SE has a downward impact on iPhone ASP, of course, because it comes at the low end of the range. From a gross margin perspective, it is slightly dilutive to company margins, but the impact is not particularly large.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) LLC (Broker)</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay, okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">On the Apple TV question, the introduction of Apple TV and tvOS last October and the subsequent OS releases and what's coming out this fall, think of that as building the foundation for what we believe can be a broader business over time. And so I don't want to be more precise than that. But you shouldn't look at what's there today and think we've done what we want to do. We've built a foundation that we can do something bigger off of.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) LLC (Broker)</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Thank you for the question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Nancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Thank you, Kulbinder. A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks as a podcast on the iTunes Store, as a webcast on Apple/investor, and via telephone.

Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good day everyone and welcome to this Apple, Incorporated Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2016 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple CEO Tim Cook, and he will be followed by CFO Luca Maestri. And after that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, and future business outlook. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2015, the forms 10-Q for the first three quarters of fiscal 2016, and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information which speak as of their respective dates.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We're in the middle of a very busy season for Apple, and on Thursday of this week, we're holding another event here on the Apple campus. All of us are excited and we think our customers are going to love these latest innovations.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Our results for the September quarter were very strong. We generated $46.9 billion in revenue in the quarter, toward the high end of our guidance range. Gross margin was 38%, at the very top of our range. We sold 45.5 million iPhones, reflecting continued improvement in year-over-year performance compared to the last two quarters, as we forecasted in January. iPhone sales were up year-over-year in 33 of our top 40 markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">As you know, iPhone customers are the most satisfied and loyal customers in the world, and fiscal 2016 saw more customers switch from Android to iPhone than ever before. This is due to the superior customer experience we deliver with our products, and it's something no other company can match.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We had a record-setting quarter for Services, with revenue growth accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion. App Store revenue continued to skyrocket, while Music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple Music. In fact, J.D. Power recently announced that Apple Music enjoys the highest customer satisfaction rating in the streaming music market.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Earlier this month I visited Japan, where Apple Pay went live yesterday. Japanese customers are already in the habit of making contactless payments where they commute, dine and shop, so we expect a strong response and rapid adoption of Apple Pay. Around the world, we're seeing very strong growth in transaction volume through Apple Pay, which also launched in Russia and New Zealand this month and is coming to Spain in the next few months.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Apple Pay transactions were up nearly 500% year-on-year for the September quarter. In fact, we completed more transactions in the month of September than we did across all of fiscal 2015. And with Apple Pay support now built into Safari, hundreds of thousands of websites are bringing Apple Pay to their customers. Our major partners tell us that Apple Pay shows the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We remain very confident about the future of our Services business given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction and loyalty of our growing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our Services revenue in the last four years, and as we've said before, we expect it to be the size of a Fortune 100 company in fiscal 2017.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">As for our newest products, we're thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. These are the best iPhones we've ever made, with breakthrough camera systems, immersive stereo speakers, and the best iPhone performance in battery life ever, thanks to the custom-designed Apple A10 Fusion chip. They feature the brightest, most colorful iPhone displays to date and come in gorgeous new finishes. Demand continues to outstrip supply, but we're working very hard to get them into customers' hands as quickly as possible.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We're also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world's most popular smartwatch, packed with new features including built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display and a powerful dual-core processor. Individuals and businesses alike are recognizing the potential of Apple Watch to help people stay healthy, motivated and connected. One recent example is Aetna, which has announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members' health experience by subsidizing Apple Watch for individual customers and select large employers. In addition, Aetna is also providing Apple Watch to nearly 50,000 of its own employees to encourage them to live a healthier day.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We've just rolled out new versions of iOS, macOS and watchOS and customers are loving the many great new features including Siri on the Mac, enhanced health and fitness capabilities for Apple Watch and a delightful new way to experience your photos on iOS with a feature we call memories. We've made massive advances in messages, making them more expressive and fun than ever with powerful animations, invisible ink and handwritten notes. We're seeing great offerings from developers in the all new App Store for Messages, and there has been a marked increase in our monthly active users.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">One of the great new features of iOS 10 is the Home app, which is making home automation easy to set up and intuitive to use. Customers can easily set up and securely control all their HomeKit accessories, from lights and cameras to the garage doors and air conditioners, all from their favorite iOS devices. We expect over 100 HomeKit-compatible products to be on the market by the end of this year, all reviewed and approved by Apple to help ensure customer security when using them. Our Apple stores are wonderful places to discover and learn about these great products for the connected home.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">With our latest operating systems, machine learning is making our products and services smarter, more intuitive and even more personal. We've been using these technologies for years to create better user experiences, and we've also been investing heavily both through R&amp;D and acquisitions. Today, machine learning drives improvements in countless features across our products. It enables the proactive features in iOS 10, which offers suggestions on which app you might want to use or which context you might want to include in an email. Our camera and photo software uses advanced face recognition to help you take better pictures and object and scene recognition to make them easier to sort and find. Machine learning makes the fitness features of Apple Watch more accurate and even helps extend battery life across our products.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Machine learning continually helps Siri get even smarter in areas such as understanding natural language. We've extended Siri to work in many new ways by opening it to developers and most recently by making Siri available to Mac users in Mac OS Sierra. We're already seeing great momentum in just the first few weeks from developers leveraging the Siri and speech APIs and we're very happy with the engagement it's driving with Siri.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Looking ahead, we're seeing some very exciting developments in India. Reliance Jio is rolling out a a first of its kind all-IP network in India with 4G coverage in 18,000 cities and 200,000 villages across the country. They're offering a free year of service to purchasers of new iPhones and we're partnering with them to ensure great iPhone performance on their network. Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in fiscal 2016 compared to the prior year, and we believe we're just beginning to scratch the surface of this large and growing market opportunity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We're also very happy with the progress of our enterprise market initiatives, which continue to expand. Just last month, we announced a partnership with Deloitte to help companies quickly and easily transform the way they work by maximizing the power, ease of use, and security of the iOS platform. Deloitte is creating a unique Apple practice with over 5,000 strategic advisors focused on helping businesses transform work in functions across the enterprise. We're also collaborating on the development of Enterprise Next, a new Deloitte consulting service designed to help clients across more than 20 industries take full advantage of the iOS ecosystem and quickly develop custom solutions through rapid prototyping.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">As we close the books on another incredible year, I'd like to thank our talented employees for their hard work and passion for making the best products in the world, our amazing developer community for their relentless creativity and our wonderful customers, business partners and shareholders for their loyalty and support.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Now I'll hand it over to Luca to share more details on the September quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"><strong>Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the September quarter was $46.9 billion, towards the high end of our guidance range. Our revenue grew very strongly in many emerging markets, including Russia, Turkey, the Middle East, Thailand and Vietnam, and we continue to see solid growth in Japan and in Latin America.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Gross margin was 38%, at the top of our guidance range, thanks to favorable cost performance. Operating margin was 25.1% of revenue and net income was $9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67 and cash flow from operations was $16.1 billion, which is a new record for the September quarter. For details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 45.5 million iPhones in the quarter, thanks to the very successful launch of iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus and continued strong demand for other iPhones. Including 2.7 million iPhones that were in transit at the end of the quarter, we increased iPhone channel inventory by 2.5 million units, and we exited the quarter well below our five to seven week target range of channel inventory.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets around the world, including Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East, India and South Asia. iPhone sales in Greater China declined during the quarter, but the initial customer response to iPhone 7 and 7 Plus gives us confidence that our December quarter performance in China will be significantly better on a year-over-year basis than our September quarter results, even as we lap the all-time record period from a year ago.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Worldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 Plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 Plus, and we're working very hard to get the new iPhones into the hands of our customers as quickly as possible.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">iPhone ASP increased to $619 in the September quarter, which was above our expectations. That's up from $595 in the June quarter when we launched iPhone SE and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. We expect iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a level similar to our ASP in the December quarter last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Customer interest and satisfaction with iPhone remains extremely strong. In the U.S. for instance, the latest survey fielded by 451 Research found that among consumers planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 65% plan to purchase iPhone, with the current iPhone owners reporting a 97% customer satisfaction rating. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey measured a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating and found that of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 79% planned to purchase iPhone.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to Services, we generated an all-time record $6.3 billion in revenue with an increase of 24% over a year ago. The App Store growth rate has now accelerated for five consecutive quarters, reaching 43% in the September quarter. The App Store remains the preferred destination for both customers and developers. According to App Annie, it generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the September quarter. In addition to the great performance from apps, we saw strong double-digit revenue growth in several other service categories and Apple Pay transaction volume has grown dramatically, as Tim mentioned.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Next I'd like to talk about the Mac. We sold 4.9 million Macs, facing a difficult year-over-year compare, given the launch of new Macs in the spring of 2015. Despite this, our Mac installed base reached a new all-time high at the end of the September quarter and we'll have some exciting news to share with current and future Mac owners very soon. We ended the quarter below our four to five week target range for Mac channel inventory.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to iPad, revenue was flat compared to last year. iPad ASP was $459, $26 higher than a year ago, with increase driven by the new iPad Pro line. We sold 9.3 million iPads, and we reduced channel inventory by about 80,000 units, exiting the quarter below our five to seven-week target range.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics in the segments of the tablet market where we compete. Recent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the U.S. tablet market in the September quarter and had 82% share of tablets priced above $200. And in August, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini, 95% rate for iPad Air, and a 93% rate for iPad Pro. Among U.S. consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 73% plan to purchase an iPad, more than eight times the purchase intention rate of the next highest brand measured, with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a 94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 68% for the December quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In the enterprise market, we are seeing some great examples of iPad and Mac deployment. Our Mobility Partner Program continues to grow stronger, with over 120 partners around the world offering tailored solutions to businesses of all sizes. Revel Systems, a leading iPad point-of-sale solution partner, recently announced a global agreement with Shell retail to implement Revel's iPad based POS system services at 34,000 Shell locations worldwide, including support for Apple Pay in countries where Apple Pay is available.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">IBM has just released new data on the great results of its Mac rollout. With more employees choosing Mac than ever before, there are now more than 90,000 Macs across the organization in addition to 48,000 iPads and 81,000 iPhones. IBM reports that PCs have three times the cost to manage, drive twice the number of support calls and are 5 times more likely to require a follow-up appointment to resolve an issue than Macs. Thanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the company is saving as much as $535 per computer when comparing the total cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a full-year lifecycle.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.6 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion. $216 billion of this cash or 91% of the total was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion of debt in July, leaving us with $79 billion in term debt at the end of the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We returned over $9 billion to investors during the September quarter as follows. We paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $3 billion on repurchases of 28.6 million Apple shares through open market transactions, and we launched a new $3 billion ASR, resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 22.5 million shares. We also completed our seventh accelerated share repurchase program, with adding an additional 12.3 million shares. So total buyback activity during the quarter reduced our share count by 1.5%. We have now completed $186 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program, including $133 billion in share repurchases.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">During the September quarter, we also completed four acquisitions and incurred $3.6 billion in capital expenditures. Our total CapEx for the year was $12.8 billion. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, slightly higher than the 25.5% we guided to because of a differential graphic mix of earnings relative to our regional expectations. Our tax rate for the full fiscal year was 25.6%</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">As we move ahead into the December quarter, I would like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $76 billion and $78 billion. This represents a return to growth over the all-time revenue record set in the December quarter a year ago. We expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.9 billion and $7 billion. We expect OI&amp;E to be about $400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Also today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock, payable on November 10, 2016, to shareholders of record as of November 7, 2016.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">With that, I would like to open the call to questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">And we ask that you limit yourself to one one-part question and one follow up. May we have the first question, please?</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p5\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">First we'll hear from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eugene Charles Munster - Piper Jaffray &amp; Co.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Hey, good afternoon and congratulations. And Tim, now that we're a month in the iPhone 7, are you seeing anything measurable in terms of the growing trend of annual upgrades? And second is, historically in terms of new product categories, you guys have always looked for unique advantage before getting into a segment. And I'm curious about the car. There are a lot of rumors out there, and would like your perspective on how you think about an advantage that Apple could add in the auto space?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">In terms of iPhone 7, Gene, the carriers that had upgrade plans, the information that we have from them is that demand is very robust. But from a worldwide point of view, the truth is that demand is outstripping supply in the vast majority of places, particularly on the iPhone 7 Plus. And so it's sort of we are in a situation at the moment, it's difficult in the early weeks to be able to differentiate. But on an anecdotal basis, it's clear the upgrade programs are a win.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">I can't speak about rumors, but as you know, we look for ways that we can improve the experience and the customers' experience on different sets of products. And we are always looking at new things, and the car space in general is an area that it's clear that there is a lot of technologies that will either become available or will be able to revolutionize the car experience. And so it's interesting from that point of view, but nothing to, certainly nothing to announce today.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eugene Charles Munster - Piper Jaffray &amp; Co.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Just one quick follow up in terms of the supply. Do you think we'll be at equilibrium by the end of the quarter for iPhone supplies?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">It's hard to say. I believe that on iPhone 7 we will. On iPhone 7 Plus, I'm not sure. I wouldn't say yes at this point, because the underlying demand looks extremely strong on both products but particularly on the iPhone 7 Plus versus our forecast going into the product launch.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eugene Charles Munster - Piper Jaffray &amp; Co.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Thanks, Gene. Can we have the next question, please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Thanks. Good afternoon. Luca, can you help us understand what's embedded in revenue guidance for the extra week as well as any rebuilding of channel inventory given all the major products are running below target? Just trying to get at whether you see revenue and in particular iPhone growth year on year on more of a sellout basis when you adjust for those two factors? And then I have a follow up.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Yes Katy, sure. Let me say a few things on the 14th week and revenue up for the December quarter. Keep in mind that December quarter a year ago for us was an all-time quarterly revenue record. We think we can grow this year. As Tim said, the interest from customers on iPhone 7 and 7 Plus is very strong. The strength of our Services business, you've seen we've grown 24% in September. We think we can continue to grow very well into the December quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">You mentioned the 14th week, and the few extra days do help us this quarter. But I think it's important to keep in mind that there are other factors that go and offset these extra few days. As you know, the launch timing of the new iPhone is different this year. We had the first 90 days of sales this year hit Q4. There were only two days last year, so the cadence has moved more towards the Q4 this year versus Q1 last year. As you know, we increased iPhone channel inventory by 3.3 million units in the first quarter of 2016. As Tim said, we are very supply constrained on iPhone 7 Plus this year. We're simply more supply constrained this year than we were a year ago.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">And then keep in mind that there were a couple of things that affect the compare as well, which is the fact that a year ago, we had an award for a patent infringement of $548 million, which is obviously a one-off item that is not going to repeat this year. And also the foreign exchange environment remains difficult, and we expect FX to be about $650 million headwind on a year-over-year basis into the December quarter. So I hope that gives you a bit of a sense that when you take into account all these factors, we believe that this is a good guidance for the December quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">That's great color. Thank you for that. A follow up for Tim. What should we read into the fact that R&amp;D has more than doubled over the past three years while sales growth was sort of a fifth of that? Are R&amp;D investments just less efficient than they were in the company's history, or should we think about that as incremental spend for products that haven't yet come to market?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">There's clearly some amount of R&amp;D that are on products that today are in the development phase that have not reached the market, and so that's a part of it. And we feel really great about the things that we've got. We've also put a lot of emphasis on our Services business as well and on making the ecosystem even better. And so we're very much, we're confidently investing in the future, and that's the reason you see the R&amp;D spend increasing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Thank you, Katy. Could we have the next question, please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">From Cross Research, Shannon Cross.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Thank you very much. A couple of questions. The first, Tim, can you talk a bit more about China, just how you're thinking about it, where you're seeing pressure? I know you mentioned that you expect to see a significant rebound during the first quarter, but what are your customers telling you about the demand in China?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Yeah, it's a good question, Shannon. So to sort of back up from our results for the quarter, the 90-day clock, and look at the full year of 2016, we were down 17% compared to the fiscal year 2015 which was up 84% from the previous year. So if you look at 2014 to 2016, the revenue grew 52% and the CAGR was 23%, which is really a pretty good result.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Also as you probably know, the fiscal year 2016 performance was hurt by the devaluation of the currency which affected it about 3%, so the underlying business performance was 14% down. And so, why was it down? There's lots of reasons, but the largest one in our view is that when you look at what happened in 2015 in China, we had a surge of upgraders that came into the market for the iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus, and the upgrade rate increased relatively more in Greater China than elsewhere around the world. And so when that upgrade rate in fiscal year 2016 returned to a more normal upgrade rate, which would be akin to what we saw with the iPhone 5S as a point, it had further to fall. And so that's the main reason in our view that you see a difference.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Now that spun or created another issue for us, because we didn't forecast that accurately. So in Q1 of last year, we put in too much channel inventory and had been resetting the channel inventory over the few quarters that came beyond it or came after it. And so those two issues, which really the main one is really the first one and the second one was a symptom of it, are in our views the main issue. Now looking forward, the response to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus has been very positive. It's very hard to gauge demand, as you know, when you're selling everything you're making. And so we'll find out more through the quarter, but we're confident enough to give you guys guidance that we're returning to growth this quarter, which obviously feels very good for us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And from a longer-term point of view, out of the 90-day clocks and so forth, we are very bullish on China. We continue to see a middle class that is booming there. There might be some sort of a new normal in the economy, but a new normal there is still a good growth rate. And so with the number of middle class \u2013 people growing into the middle class and the LTE adoption rate being still fairly low, around 45%, 50% or so, then I think we continue to have a really good opportunity there, and so we continue to focus significantly in China.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Great. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And then can you talk a bit about acquisitions? And I don't mean like the smaller ones that you've done sort of at a normal cadence, but there was clearly a fairly large one announced at least this week in the content world. And especially if you find a way to have repatriation of some of the cash at a low tax rate possibly with the next administration. So I just, if you can give sort of an overall view of how you think about acquisitions that might be a little bit larger than normal.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">We are open to acquisitions of any size that are of strategic value where we can deliver better products to our customers and innovate more. And so we look at a whole variety of companies, and based on that, we choose whether to move forward or not. But we're definitely open and we definitely look.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thank you, Shannon. Could we have the next question, please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">We'll go to Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Antonio M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yes. Thank you. I have a question and a follow-up, please. I guess a cynic could say Apple is benefiting from an extra week this quarter and is benefiting from Samsung being in complete disarray. And yet from your guidance, it's unclear that iPhone unit growth will be up or certainly not up more than low single-digits implied from your guidance. And I appreciate some of the issues around channel inventory build and the timing of the launch, but if I just stand back from that and say you have terrific new products, your major competitor's laying down, you have an enormous, you have a significant contribution from an extra week, arguably 7% or 8%, and yet the iPhone growth is sort of flattish, what does that really say about how investors should think about iPhone on a sustained basis growing forward? And is it reasonable to think that this is an ongoing growing business for the company?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Toni, let me take this one. I think you mentioned a number of the things that are affecting us in the December quarter, and I went through them with Katy just a few minutes ago. You're right, we've got an extra few days. You know very well the launch timing is different. You know that we increased iPhone channel inventory by 3.3 million units a year ago. I mentioned two issues that affect us, the one-timer from a year ago that you obviously need to exclude from the compare and the FX that is the reality of our business right now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">But maybe the most important element of this is the fact that we are supply constrained on 7 and 7 Plus. And so when you talk about other competitors, it's not particularly relevant to us right now because we are selling everything that we can produce. And so when we look at all these things in its totality, we think that for the total company of course, we believe that revenue's going to grow. You know that we don't get into specific product from a unit standpoint giving guidance, and so we feel very confident about the trajectory for the company and for iPhone going forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Antonio M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. Tim, if I could ask you one, please. You've talked in the past about television being an area of intense interest. I was wondering if you could reaffirm that statement. Is that still the case? And then additionally, given what's happening with acquisitions, how broadly you think about the role of content. Apple has started creating on a very limited scale some of its own content and whether you think content creation and ownership is important to Apple, or whether Apple ultimately sees its place in the value chain as being more around the ecosystem and distribution.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I would confirm that television has intense interest with me and many other people here. In terms of owning content and creating content, we have started with focusing on some original content, as you point out. We've got a few things going there that we've talked about. And I think it's a great opportunity for us both from a creation point of view and an ownership point of view. and so it's is an area that we're focused on.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thank you, Toni. Could we have the next question, please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">From Goldman Sachs, Simona Jankowski.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thank you. I have a question for Luca and then one for Tim as well. Luca, I wanted to dig into the Services business a bit more. As you pointed out, it accelerated again to 24%. How does that compare to the pace of growth of the installed base, just to help us decouple how much of it is consumption driven on a per user basis versus the base as a whole?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Simona, the installed base number is something that we talk about periodically. The last time we talked about it, it was in the January call. It is growing. Our installed base is growing very well, which is very important for us. It's growing on all major products and it's growing of course in total. When you look at our Services revenue, the growth of the Services revenue has been accelerating during the course of the year during a period when, as you know, our revenue came down slightly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So what that means in practice is that what we are seeing with our customers that consume our services is that the people that are actually taking advantage of our services over time tend spend more and more on our services. We've got customers that are very engaged with our products. They're very loyal, and so you see this upward trajectory of our Services business. It's not only with the App Store but there's several categories that are growing very well for us. Tim mentioned Apple Music, but we got other parts of the business that continue to do well, even as I said during a period of time when our sales have come down a bit.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thank you. And then Tim, we've seen an increasing focus on artificial intelligence, both in smartphones like the new Pixel from Google but also in some of the home assistance, like the Amazon Echo. And you guys have obviously had Siri for a while as well. But I just am curious how you think about balancing AI with your focus on privacy. And then also how important it is to have a dedicated home assistant versus just having the phone as the home assistant?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I think to answer your second question first, I think that most people would like an assistant with them all the time. And we live in a mobile society. People are constantly moving from home to work and to other things that they may be doing. And so the advantage of having a assistant on your phone is it's with you all the time. That doesn't say that there is not a nice market for a home one. I'm not making that point. I'm just saying on a balance point of view, I think the usage of one on the phone will likely be much greater.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">In fact, you can just look at Siri today and this is now accelerating with iOS 10 and the Mac, but we've been getting 2 billion requests a week for Siri. And so it's very large and to the best of our knowledge, we've shipped more assistant enabled devices than probably anyone out there. Our focus is on this worldwide, and so it's not only a U.S. focus, but we want to deliver a great experience around the world and deliver it globally, and so we've put a lot of the energy into doing that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">In terms of the balance between privacy and AI, this is a long conversation, but at a high level, I think it's a false trade-off that people would like you to believe that you have to give up privacy in order to have AI do something for you. We don't buy that. It may take a different kind of work. It might take more thinking, but I don't think we should throw our privacy away. It's sort of like the age-old argument about privacy versus security. We should have both. It shouldn't be making a choice. And so that at a high level is how we see it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thank you, Simona. Could we have the next question, please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">We'll go to Steve Milunovich with UBS.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thank you very much. Luca, I wanted ask you about the total deferred revenue which was down about $1.3 billion in June and I think down another $400 million in September. Those are rather large declines, even given the fact that your units are coming down and you had the accounting change back in September. Could you talk about some of the drivers of that and what you might expect going forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Steve, you mentioned by far the largest driver. The largest driver is the fact that we made the change, an accounting change to our ESPs exactly a year ago. So we are lapping the year where you see the effect. I think you're not going to see the same thing going forward. And then we tend to defer some revenue on some other categories, like for example gift cards or some AppleCare, but in general by far the largest element is the change in ESPs. And again, I don't think you're going to see the same impact going forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. Thank you. And then, Tim, some investors are antsy that Apple has not acquired new profit pools or introduced a financially material new product in recent years. The question is, A, does Apple today have a grand strategy for what you want to do? I know you won't tell us what it us, but do you know what you want to do over the next three to maybe five years? Or is it more a read the market and quickly react? And B, do you have any sense that we're kind of in a gap period where the technology and arguably what we'd call the next job to be done haven't yet aligned? And so maybe in a couple years, we will see this flurry of new products and it'll sort of match what people want to do, but it's not quite here yet?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We have the strongest pipeline that we've ever had and we're really confident about the things in it. But as usual, we're not going to talk about what's ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">But in terms of your approach I guess to new products, do you have a strong sense of where technology is going and where you're going to play? Or is it still enough up the year that you are willing to react fairly quickly, which arguably your organization allows you to do for the size of company you are?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We have a strong sense of where things go and we're very agile to shift as we need to.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Thanks, Steve. Could we have the next question, please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">From Bank of America, Wamsi Mohan.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes. Thank you. So, Tim and Luca, you saw that you could raise the ASP on the iPhone 7 Plus by $20 and you're completely sold out. So clearly this device plays a central role in our lives, so much that owners probably look at that incremental cost as a great trade-off to get the best device out there. So as you see more and more features being added into iPhones, do you conceptually expect that you are anywhere close to the point where raising ASPs further would be net disruptive to demand? Or do you see more rooms to raise ASPs over time as you add incremental features? And I have a follow up.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">With the iPhone 7 Plus, we put an incredible amount of innovation into the camera and the overall photo experience, and customers are obviously using that and have discovered that they love it. And so we're getting an incredible amount of feedback there. We also get incredible feedback on the iPhone 7. And, but the mix that we projected on iPhone 7 Plus is short of what the reality is and so we are chasing supply there. In terms of the ASP, the way we think about it is we want to charge a fair price and so we don't want to charge more than that, and we think it's worth being fair. And so that's how we look at it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">If I can add, Wamsi, keep in mind that in a lot of countries around the world, the reality is that our customers have seen some significant price increases because of the FX situation, right. And that's something that we need to keep in mind as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Great. Thanks. Thanks for the clarification. And Tim, this year we saw carrier incentives come back to force post the launch of the iPhone 7, 7 Plus. Two years ago there was a giant upgrade to iPhone from the iPhone 6, 6 Plus. Do you think every couple of years we are likely to see carrier incentives come back into play given worries around customer churn, thereby making the phone even more affordable? Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">We clearly saw that this year. There's a lot of competition for customers in the U.S. which I think is the market that you're talking about. Whether that'll happen every two years, I don't know. But I suspect that any time there are large numbers of customers that have a phone that's in that two year kind of range that it tends to be a sweet spot, and I think you probably will see a lot of people trying to recruit those customers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thanks, Tim.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yeah. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thank you, Wamsi. Could we have the next question, please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Jim Suva with Citi.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James D. Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thank you very much. A strategy question for Tim and then more of a financial question for Luca. Tim, you'd mentioned in your prepared comments a little bit about India and we've been doing a lot of work talking about the opportunity in India. And we get a lot of pushback talking about disposable income metrics and lots of things like that, yet the population being so large, can you talk a little bit about, do you see that India could at some point be as big of an opportunity as China? And it appears that the legal rules have kind of prevented you from going in a lot, but it looks like that's changing. Can you just kind of give us a little more clarity on India?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And then, Tim, for the clarification questions, is it fair to say that the OpEx has a disproportionate more expense side with the 14th week that we should kind of think of maybe as we go forward, that we shouldn't expect the OpEx to kind of be chugging along at that high rate? Or is it just kind of the rate of investing that you're going? Thank you very much, gentlemen.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yeah, thanks for the question. I'll let Luca talk about the OpEx piece of it. On India, I think it's important to look not only at per capita income, which may be what you're looking at, but sort of look at the number of people that are or will move into the middle class sort of over the next decade. And the age of the population, if you look at India, almost 50% of the population is under 25. And so you have a very, very young population.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">The smartphone has not done as well in India in general. However, one of the key reasons for that is the infrastructure hasn't been there. But this year or this year and next year, there are enormous investments going in on 4G and we couldn't be more excited about that because it really takes a great network working with iPhone to produce that great experience for people. And so I see a lot of the factors moving in the right direction there. I also think the government is much more focused on the infrastructure and on creating jobs, which is fantastic, because you really need the kind of infrastructure and the technology to do that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Will it be as big as China? I think it's clear that the population of India will exceed China sometime in probably the next decade or so, maybe less than that. I think it will take longer for the GDP to rival it, but that's not critical for us to have a great success there. The truth is, there's going to be a lot of people there and a lot of people in the middle class that will really want a smartphone, and I think we can compete well for some percentage of those. And given our starting point, even though we've been growing a lot, there is a lot of headroom there in our mind, and so we are working very hard to realize that opportunity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And, Jim, on OpEx, our approach to OpEx is quite clear and quite simple. We want to continue to invest in the business in all the areas where we think is critical for us to invest. So you see that we make significant investments in R&amp;D. You've seen the growth rates over the last couple of years. We are making important investments in data centers because we want to support our services business. We continue to open retail stores around the world. We continue to invest in marketing and advertising. At the same time, we want to continue to be efficient and lean. It's something that we've done very well over the years and want to continue to do that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So what you've seen, for example in fiscal 2016, you've seen investments in R&amp;D growing at 25% and then our SG&amp;A expenses to be about flat. And this is kind of the approach that we want to take and continue to take going forward. If you step back for a second and you look at our implied guidance for the December quarter, we got an expense to revenue ratio of 9%. This is extremely competitive in our industry and I would say in general. And so we want to continue to have this balance, make the right investments and remain efficient.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James D.

Can we have the next question, please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">We'll go to Rod Hall with JPMorgan.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yeah, hi, guys. Thanks for the question. I had one for Luca and then a follow-up for Tim. So, Luca, I wanted to ask about the gross margin guidance. I think that the Street and we were expecting something a little bit higher. And again, that's about 50 basis points lower and the Street it was I think 70 basis points lower. And I'm just curious, do you think that people are mis-modeling that or is there something going on with pricing or mix there that you could provide us more color on? So that's my first question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yeah, Rod, let me give you some detail both on a sequential basis and I'll give you also something on a year-over-year basis because maybe that's where the disconnect comes from, looking at the last year's gross margins in the December quarter. On a sequential basis, we are essentially guiding to some improvement in gross margins. We had 38% both in the June quarter and in the September quarter. We're guiding slightly higher for the December quarter because on the positive, we're going to have of course better leverage and the mix in the December quarter tends to be better. But we need to keep into account the fact that these positives are going to be partially offset by the cost structures of the new products that we are launching now and we've launched already a few during the September quarter and that will have an impact on our December quarter results.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">On a year-over-year basis, keep in mind that last year we did, in Q1, we did 40%, around 40%, 40%, 41%, but there's a couple of things that I think need to be considered before doing a year-over-year compare. And it's the fact that last year we had this award for a patent infringement of $548 million. That is, at the gross margin level, is 40 bps. And then we've got the FX situation, which I mentioned before, which is worth another 60 bps, 70 bps. And so you're left with less than 100 basis points deterioration on a year-over-year basis where again, we have the reality of new cost structures into our products.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">It is very, very important I think for investors to understand that what's happened during the last two years. During the last two years, the U.S. dollar has appreciated by 15% over the basket of currencies where we do business. And we're a company that generates two thirds of our revenues outside the United States, 15% appreciation of the U.S. dollar. So on a year-over-year basis, just 2016 over 2015 was 340 bps impact from foreign exchange. This is something that we have offset almost entirely through a number of initiatives going from pricing actions to cost initiatives to our hedging program, but at some point, the strong dollar becomes the new normal and we need to work with that. And I think over the years, we made very good trade-offs and our gross margins have been quite stable over time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. Great. Thanks, Luca. And then, Tim, I wanted you to ask you, this question comes up once in a while, but I just wanted to ask you if you could talk to us a little bit about the arguments on both sides of the dividend question. I mean, Apple seems to be perpetually undervalued. It's a very large company. It's getting harder and harder to grow. Your payout ratio is significantly below the S&amp;P 500. I know you can't tell us what your intentions are here, but if you could help us understand how that thinking around the dividend works, it would be great.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">We review the capital return annually, and we've established a cadence now to announce our thinking on that every April. And so we have a robust discussion around the dividend and the buyback. We very much believe that Apple is very undervalued, and so we're investing with confidence in the company that we know really well. And so that thinking has I think proven out over time and I think been very good for our shareholders. And in addition to that, we know that some shareholders really like a dividend and some ongoing income, and so we've provided a amount that we think is a good amount and have a good track record of raising it annually. And so we'll be able to say more on that I'm sure in April of next year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Thank you, Rod.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Rod B.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Speaking first is Apple CEO Tim Cook, and he'll be followed by CFO Luca Maestri. And after that, we will open the call to questions from analysts.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, and future business outlook. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast.

Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you, Nancy, and good afternoon everyone, and thanks very much for joining us. I'm very happy to share with you the outstanding results of Apple's December quarter. We generated the highest quarterly revenue in Apple's history along with all-time unit and revenue records for iPhone and Apple Watch, all-time revenue records for Services and Mac, and all-time revenue records for four out of our five geographic segments. The strong performance of our business also produced all-time record earnings per share.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Revenue in the quarter was $78.4 billion, which was above the top of our guidance range. iPhone had a tremendous quarter thanks to exceptional demand that beat our own internal expectations. While iPhone 7 is our most popular model, we saw especially strong demand for iPhone 7 Plus, which was a higher portion of the new product mix than we've ever seen with Plus models in the past. Demand for iPhone 7 Plus exceeded supply throughout the quarter, and we came into supply/demand balance in January.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">iPhone 7 Plus has earned rave reviews for its advanced new features, especially the dual camera system, which produces stunning portraits and high-quality zoom. This is a uniquely Apple feature that is surprising and delighting our users. Both iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are empowering our customers to be more productive, more engaged, and more expressive than ever by integrating hardware, software, and services to create experiences that only Apple can deliver.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">It was our best quarter ever for Services, with almost $7.2 billion in revenue. App Store customers broke all-time records during the holiday quarter, including $3 billion in purchases in December alone, making it the App Store's single best month ever.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Our innovative and vibrant developer community has created over 2.2 million apps for doing almost anything that you can imagine. Apple's developer community has now earned over $60 billion, including over $20 billion in 2016 alone.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Revenue from our music business grew for the third quarter in a row, and our AppleCare and iPlus storage services had all-time record results.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Apple Pay continued its strong momentum, with the number of users more than tripling over the past year and hundreds of millions of transactions and billions of dollars in purchases in the December quarter alone. Transaction volume was up over 500% year over year as we expanded to four new countries, including Japan, Russia, New Zealand, and Spain, bringing us into a total of 13 markets. Apple Pay on the Web is delivering our partners great results. Nearly 2 million small businesses are accepting invoice payments with Apply Pay through Intuit QuickBooks Online, FreshBooks, and other billing partners. And beginning this quarter, Comcast customers can pay their monthly bill in a single touch with Apple Pay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Services are becoming a larger part of our business, and we expect the revenues to be the size of a Fortune 100 company this year. Our Services offerings are now driving over 150 million paid customer subscriptions. This includes our own services and third-party content that we offer on our stores. We feel great about this momentum, and our goal is to double the size of our Services business in the next four years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">The Mac not only returned to growth but generated its highest quarterly revenue ever. Our latest data shows that most Mac customers are buying their first Mac, with the vast majority of them coming from a Windows PC.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">The new MacBook Touch with Touch Bar is an outstanding example of the innovation made possible by integrating world-class hardware and software. We were supply constrained for the new MacBook Pro throughout the December quarter and are just now coming into supply/demand balance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">It was also our best quarter ever for Apple Watch, both units and revenues, with holiday demand so strong that we couldn't make enough. Apple Watch is the best-selling smartwatch in the world and also the most loved, with the highest customer satisfaction in its category by a wide margin. Apple Watch is the ultimate device for a healthy life, and it is the gold standard for smartwatches. We couldn't be more excited about Apple Watch.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We're also thrilled with the response to AirPods. Customers love the magical experience AirPods are delivering. And if you haven't tried them yet, you'll be delighted when you do. They're far ahead of anything else on the market today, and we're working hard to catch up with the incredible demand.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">With AirPods off to a fantastic start, a strong full first year for Apple Watch, and Beats headphones offering a great wireless experience using the Apple-designed W1 chip, we now have a rich lineup of wearable products. Their design, elegance, and ease of use make us very excited about the huge growth potential for wearables going forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Our ecosystem is broadening to more and more of the areas where people spend their time, at the gym, on the go, in the home, and on the job. For example, every major automaker is committed to supporting CarPlay with over 200 different models announced, including five of the top 10 selling models in the United States. There are well over 1 million people using CarPlay now, and this continues to grow rapidly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">And we are leading the industry by being the first to integrate home automation into a major platform with iOS 10. With Siri and a new Home app in iOS 10, everywhere you go, you can easily and securely control all of your home accessories with your iPhone, iPad, or your Apple Watch.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">The number of HomeKit-compatible accessories continues to grow rapidly, with many exciting solutions announced just this month, including video cameras, motion detectors, and sensors for doors, windows, and even water leaks. Perhaps even more importantly, we are unmatched when it comes to securing your home with HomeKit-enabled door locks, garage doors, and alarm systems.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">I'm personally using HomeKit accessories and the Home app to integrate iOS into my home routine. Now when I say good morning to Siri, my house lights come on and my coffee starts brewing. When I go to the living room to relax in the evening, I use Siri to adjust the lighting and turn on the fireplace. And when I leave the house, a simple tap on my iPhone turns the lights off, adjusts the thermostat down, and locks the doors. When I return to my house in the evening, as I near my home, the house prepares itself for my arrival automatically by using a simple geofence. This level of home automation was unimaginable just a few years ago, and it's here today with iOS and HomeKit.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We're making great progress in the enterprise market alongside our major partners. The combination of iOS and Cisco technology is giving companies everywhere the opportunity to vastly improve the user experience for their mobile employees. With enhanced networking performance, up to eight times faster roaming, better reliability for apps, and native voice experience, we're excited about how much more productive the workforce will be with these great capabilities. In fact, the total number of joint customer opportunities has grown over 70% since last quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Enterprises are using IBM's new Mobile at Scale design and development model to deploy multiple iOS apps with speed and efficiency. For example, Finnair is transforming aircraft maintenance, and CEMEX is revamping activities from attracting new clients to invoicing to after-sales support. And later this spring, SAP will be rolling out its SDK for iOS, providing its community of more than 2.5 million developers the tools to build powerful native iOS apps that leverage the SAP HANA cloud platform. We're delighted with how these partnerships are making it even easier for enterprise customers to transform how work gets done with iOS.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">As we reflect on a record-breaking December quarter, I'd like to thank our developers, our business partners, and our employees for their incredible contributions and commitment. And I'd like to thank all of our customers around the world for their excitement and loyalty, which ultimately drive these results.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Now I'd like to turn it over to Luca to talk about the quarter in more detail.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"><strong>Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone. Revenue for the December quarter was $78.4 billion, the highest quarterly revenue in the history of Apple and above our guidance range. As Tim mentioned, the strength of our results was very broad-based, as we set new revenue records for iPhone, for Services, for Mac, and for Apple Watch. We also established new all-time revenue records in most developed and emerging markets, with strong growth rates in many countries, including the U.S., Japan, Canada, France, Australia, Brazil, India, Turkey, and Russia.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We accomplished all this despite a very challenging foreign exchange environment due to the continued strength of the U.S. dollar. As we had expected, our year-over-year performance in Greater China improved significantly relative to the September quarter. Total Greater China segment revenue was down 12%, but revenue from Mainland China was even with the all-time record results from a year ago and grew in constant currency terms. In all other geographic segments, we generated all-time quarterly record results.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We had the benefit of a 14th week during the quarter this year, but this was offset by four factors. First, this year we grew China inventory significantly less than a year ago. Second, iPhone 7 launched earlier in the September quarter compared to the iPhone 6s launch the previous year, creating a more difficult comparison for the December quarter this year. Third, the stronger U.S. dollar affected total revenue growth this year by 100 basis points. And fourth, our year-ago revenue included the benefit of a one-off $548 million patent infringement payment. Also, strong customer interest left us in supply/demand imbalance for several of our products throughout the quarter this year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Gross margin was 38.5%, at the high end of our guidance range. Operating margin was 29.8% of revenue, and net income was $17.9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $3.36, a new all-time record, and cash flow from operations was $27.1 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We had a terrific quarter for iPhone as we sold 78.3 million units, a new all-time record and an increase of 5% over last year. Customer demand was even higher than our reported results, as iPhone unit sell-through was up 8%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We saw double-digit iPhone growth in the U.S., in Canada, Western Europe, Japan, and Australia, and even stronger growth in many emerging markets, including Brazil, Turkey, Russia, Central and Eastern Europe, and Vietnam. iPhone ASP increased to $695 in the December quarter from $619 in the September quarter, driven by the very strong product mix and the amazing success of iPhone 7 Plus.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Despite stronger demand than last year, we added only 1.2 million units of iPhone channel inventory across the quarter, significantly less than the increase of 3.3 million units a year ago. And we exited the quarter near the low end of our 5 to 7-week target channel inventory range.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Customer interest and satisfaction with iPhone are exceptional, not only with consumers, but also with business users. In the U.S., for instance, the latest data from 451 Research on consumers indicates a 97% customer satisfaction rating among all iPhone owners and a 99% satisfaction rating for owners of iPhone 7 Plus. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the iPhone customer satisfaction rating was 94%. And of those planning to purchase smartphones in the March quarter, 78% plan to purchase an iPhone.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to Services, we generated an all-time record $7.2 billion in revenue, an increase of 18% year over year. Our run rate growth was actually higher when taking into account two discrete items. On one hand, the 14th week added to Services revenue this December quarter. On the other hand, that benefit was more than offset by the comparison to the one-off $548 million patent infringement payment included in Services revenue a year ago.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">The App Store continued its impressive run, breaking all previous revenue records. Year-over-year App Store revenue growth was 43% through the first 13 weeks of the quarter. It's great to see that both average revenue per paying account and the number of paying accounts grew strongly during the quarter. And according to App Annie's latest report, App Store revenue continues to outpace the industry overall, with more than double the revenue of Google Play in calendar 2016.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Next I would like to talk about the Mac. We sold 5.4 million Macs and generated our highest-ever quarterly Mac revenue. We were very happy to report double-digit unit growth in several countries, including Japan, Mainland China, India, the Netherlands, and Sweden, as well as in the U.S. education market. We ended the quarter at the low end of our 4 to 5-week target range for Mac channel inventory.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Turning to iPad, we sold 13.1 million units, which was ahead of our expectations. And we posted double-digit growth in both Mainland China and India, as we've expanded distribution channels in those countries and we continue to attract a very high percentage of first-time tablet buyers. We also reduced channel inventory by about 700,000 units as opposed to an increase of 900,000 units last year, and we exited the quarter near the low end of our five to seven-week target range.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">iPad is incredibly successful in the segments of the tablet market where we compete, both in terms of market share and customer metrics. Recent data from NPD indicates that iPad had 85% share of the U.S. market for tablets priced above $200. And in November, 451 Research measured a 94% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad Mini, a 97% rate for iPad Air, and 96% for iPad Pro.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Among U.S. consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, purchase intention for iPad is more than four times higher than any other brand measured, with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a 96% satisfaction rate and a purchase intent of 66% for the March quarter. In fact, businesses of all sizes are choosing iPad and iPhone to have them reimagine their everyday activities. We're seeing strong momentum in sectors such as retail, where iOS solutions are being deployed for everything from product development to logistics to mobile point-of-sale. Companies like Toys \"R\" Us, Coach, and Kate Spade are using iOS and our mobility partner solutions to dramatically transform their customer and employee experiences.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Our retail stores experienced strong double-digit growth in visitors and revenue in the December quarter. And we continued to expand our global presence, with plans to open our first store in Singapore and our second store in Dubai soon. We are continually updating our stores and adding new and exciting outreach programs to educate kids on our products, entertain the community with fresh live music, teach future Swift developers to code, and empower entrepreneurs to start, grow, and evolve their businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $246.1 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $8.5 billion. $230.2 billion of this cash or 94% of the total was outside the United States. We also had $77.1 billion in term debt and $10.5 billion in commercial paper outstanding at quarter end.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We returned almost $15 billion to investors during a very busy December quarter for our capital return activities. We paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $5 billion on repurchases of 44.3 million Apple shares through open market transactions. And we launched a new $6 billion ASR, resulting in an initial delivery and retirement of 44.8 million shares. We also completed our eighth accelerated share repurchase program, retiring an additional 4.4 million shares. This led to a net diluted share count reduction of 65.3 million shares during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We've now completed $201 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program, including $144 billion in share repurchases. And we plan to provide investors with our annual update on the capital return program in the spring.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, as expected.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">And as we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $51.5 billion and $53.5 billion. This guidance range includes a $1.2 billion year-over-year headwind from foreign exchange. We expect gross margin to be between 38% and 39%. This guidance range includes an 80 basis points sequential headwind from foreign exchange. We expect OpEx to be between $6.5 billion and $6.6 billion. We expect OI&amp;E to be about $400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Also today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend up $0.57 per share of common stock, payable on February 16, 2017 to shareholders of record as of February 13, 2017.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">And we ask that you limit yourself to one one-part question and one follow-up. Operator, may we have the first question, please?</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p5\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Your first question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Yes, thank you. First, Luca, what are the factors that caused you to widen the gross margin guidance for the March quarter? And what are the one or two factors that put you at the low end versus the tailwinds that might put you at the high end of that range? And then I have a follow-up, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Sure, Katy. If you look back at our history, 100 basis points range for gross margin is not unusual. Clearly during a period when foreign exchange is very volatile, we think it's more prudent to broaden the range a bit. I've mentioned that we expect \u2013 assuming that rates don't move too much, we expect foreign exchange to be a major negative as we move from the December to the March quarter. You know that the dollar has appreciated significantly toward the end of the December quarter, and so we've got 80 basis points of sequential headwind from foreign exchange. We also have the sequential loss of leverage, which is typical of our seasonality, but we expect to offset these two impacts with cost efficiencies and also with our mix of products and services. So obviously if the dollar is a little less strong than it is today, we could do a bit better on gross margins. Obviously, we continue to work very hard on our cost efficiency, so we'll see where we land.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Thank you. And, Tim, there's a reasonable probability that you may get access to the $200 billion-plus of cash that's been locked overseas. So I think it would be helpful to just get an update on your views around potentially larger M&amp;A and some of the areas of interest that you've noted in the past like owning more original content to penetrate more of the TV opportunity that the company has long talked about addressing. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Katy, I am optimistic given what I'm hearing that there would likely be some sort of tax reform this year, and it does seem like there are people in both parties that would favor repatriation as a part of that. So I think that's very good for the country and good for Apple. What we would do with it, let's wait and see exactly what it is. But as I said before, we are always looking at acquisitions. We acquired 15 to 20 companies per year for the last four years. And we look for companies of all sizes, and there's not a size that we would not do based on just the size of it. It's more about the strategic value of it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">In terms of original content, we have put our toe in the water with doing some original content for Apple Music, and that will be rolling out through the year. We are learning from that, and we'll go from there. The way that we participate in the changes that are going on in the media industry that I fully expect to accelerate from the cable bundle beginning to break down is, one, we started the new Apple TV a year ago, and we're pleased with how that platform has come along. We have more things planned for it but it's come a long way in a year, and it gives us a clear platform to build off of. Two, embedded in the 150 million paid subscriptions that I mentioned in my opening comments, there are a number of third-party services that are a part of that, where we participate economically in some of that by offering our platform in selling and distributing. And then thirdly, we are obviously, with our toe in the water, we're learning a lot about the original content business and thinking about ways that we could play at that. Thanks for the question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Thanks, Katy. Could we have the next question, please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We'll go to Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Thanks a lot. Good afternoon guys. I guess the first question, I really appreciate the information you guys are providing around your Services business, which is up 18% year over year. Can you just talk about? How much of that do you think is growth in your installed base versus increased monetization on a per iOS to iOS basis? And so we are to think about those in two separate tranches?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">I think you're absolutely right, Amit. We look at it that those are the two key elements for us. And what is particularly interesting to us is to see that the number of people that are transacting on our stores is increasing strong double-digits, and we're also seeing that the ARPU per paying customer is increasing double digits, right. So it's a combination of the two.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Obviously, the quality and the quantity of content that we make available in our services improves all the time. And we also see that as people getting to the platform and start transacting on the platform, and we keep track of their behavior over time, we actually see that they tend to spend more and more over time. And that's why we are excited about the future of the Services business. And that's why, as Tim said, we have a goal that \u2013 it's already become a very large business. It's going to be a Fortune 100 company this year, but we have a goal to double it over the next four years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Perfect. And if I could just switch gears on a follow-up, there has been a fair amount of discussions around your market share in China and what's happening over there. Your numbers actually look fairly impressive in Greater China, China specifically. So could you just talk about what are the demand trends you're seeing there on the ground, and how do you see that transpire through the year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Yeah, I'll take this one. If you look at how we did in the quarter, as I think Luca shared, our Greater China revenue was down 12%, and about 4 points of that was currency related, so it's an 8 point decline in constant currency. And then within Greater China, if you look at the PRC, our revenue was flat year over year, and that was against the all-time record quarter. And if you look at that on a constant currency basis, it was actually up 6%. So it's a significantly better performance on every way you look at it versus what we had experienced the prior three quarters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Underneath that, what we've seen is that iPhone 7 was the best-selling smartphone in China during the quarter, according to Kantar. Singles Day, which is a huge day in China, as you know, we were the most popular U.S. brand on Alibaba. We set a new record for Services in China, as the company did. And Mac revenue was up double digit year over year. iPad units were also up double digit in Mainland China, which was obviously different than the trend that we saw in the balance of the world. We also saw 50% of our iPhone sales in China were to switchers and first-time buyers, which is a very high number that we're pleased with. And obviously, our total installed base continues to grow there in the strong double digits.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">That said, the challenges that are there are, one, the currency has devalued 6% year over year. And two, Hong Kong remains a very, very difficult market. And so I look at it in \u2013 I'm encouraged with the significant improvement, but we're not without challenges there. And I wouldn't want to imply that, although I do like many, many things that I've seen and how broad-based the pluses were across our product line.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Thank you, Amit. Could we have the next question, please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">From Cross Research, Shannon Cross.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Thank you very much for taking my question. Can you talk a bit more about the Services business? And what I'm trying to figure out is I think the number was you're going to be doubling within the next four years, at least that's your expectation. So what gets you there? I don't know, maybe if you talk about geographies and how penetrated you are in certain geographies. And then, as you grow your Services business, is there anything we should keep in mind from a margin perspective? Would these be lower margin services or similar, just so we can think about the trajectory and the contribution to the bottom line.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yeah, Shannon, I'll take it. Obviously, within the Services business, we have a number of categories. The App Store is the one that is driving significant growth right now. I said in my opening comments that we grew 43% 13 weeks over 13 weeks, a little even more for the quarter, right.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And what we like about the App Store is that it's truly a global platform. So we are seeing significant growth not only in the developed markets, where you expect to see a lot of transaction volume, but we see great growth in places like China, for example. And we know that there are parts of the world where we can do better. We can grow, for example, our developer community in a number of emerging markets. And so as we look, as I was explaining earlier, as we look at the number of people that transact growing double digits, we see the amount spent per paid account growing so well, we think that the App Store is going to be a significant driver of growth.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">On the music front, we are the market leader in digital music. Obviously now, by having the combination of the download business with the streaming service, which we didn't have until recently, we've been able to bring our music business back to growth. We've grown over the last three quarters, and we feel very good about that. Tim has talked about original content. We've had very good success with exclusives. So we know that it's another business that we can grow.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Our iCloud storage business is growing very quickly, and so that is a business that also at a geographic level we can continue to grow significantly. Our AppleCare business is growing very well. A lot of it comes from the fact that our install base of devices around the world continues to grow very well, strong double digits. And as we've explained in the past, the vast majority of the services that we provide is not driven by what we sell during the last 90 days. It's much more driven by the install base, and that gives us a tailwind. We're also opening up several new markets because we are accepting new forms of payment. And therefore, it's easier particularly for international customers to take advantage of our services.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">You were asking about the margin profile. We said many times, in aggregate our Services business tends to have margins that are above company average. They are accretive, so they help us quite a bit from a margin standpoint. Within the Services business, we have very different margin profiles, also because, as you know, we account for some of these services in different ways. In some cases, we transact on a buy/sell basis. In other cases, we perform as agents, for example, to our developers, and that drives different margin percentages.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thank you. And then my follow-up is just in terms of the elasticity of demand and some of the moves from a currency perspective. I think in the past there was some concern in some of the emerging markets the you were basically not able to \u2013 you weren't you're getting the volumes because you had to raise ASPs given the currency. But you talked about a lot of the emerging markets actually doing pretty well this quarter. So I'm just curious. You raised the price on the iPhone 7 Plus and that. What are you seeing, and what are your customers saying in terms of willingness to pay up?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Shannon, I was looking back. Since June of 2014, so we're talking about 2.5 years ago, the dollar has strengthened 25% against the basket of currencies where we do business. And so obviously, it is a difficult situation for us. I've mentioned that foreign exchange is a significant headwind for us, both at the revenue level and at the gross margin level. In emerging markets, it's incredible. The level of interest for our products continues to be phenomenal. The brand continues to be very aspirational. There are more and more people that can afford our products around the world. The middle class is growing in places like China, India, Brazil, but certainly the strong dollar doesn't help us. And therefore, when we make pricing decisions, we need to be very careful. We always want to find the optimal balance between units, revenue, and margin, and it becomes more difficult as the dollar appreciates.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thank you, Shannon. Could we have the next question, please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Moving on, we'll hear from Brian White with Drexel.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian J. White - Drexel Hamilton LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Luca, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about gross margins. Sales obviously beat the high end of your revenue range. It looks like gross margin was dead down the middle. Can you talk about the puts and takes in gross margins in the quarter, please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Sure. We were actually at the high end of the range for gross margins. We had guided 38% to 38.5%, and we came in at 38.5% exactly. And really, the slight improvement over the midpoint of the guidance range was due to the fact that our revenue was ahead of our expectations, and so we got a bit more leverage out of the increased revenue levels. We felt very good about the gross margins for the quarter. Again, keep in mind the strong dollar doesn't help us on that front.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian J. White - Drexel Hamilton LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. And, Tim, I didn't hear much mentioned about India. How did India perform with the iPhone? And how should we think about it for 2017, especially with the 4G network going up?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">That's a really good question. Despite the demonetization move in India that created lots of economic pressure there last quarter, despite that, we had all-time record revenue results, and so we were very happy about that. The demonetization impact has not worked its way through yet. It's still definitely having some overhang. But I think in the longer term, it's a great move, and I feel really good about how we're doing there. We are in discussions on a number of things, including retail stores, and fully intend to invest significantly in the country and believe it's a great place to be.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thank you, Brian. Could we have the next question, please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">From Goldman Sachs, we'll hear from Simona Jankowski.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Hi, thank you. I wanted to dig in a little bit more into the iPhone upside in the quarter with record revenues in every region except for Greater China. I think you touched on the percent of switchers in China. But can you give a little more color on the split of upgrades and switchers in some of the other regions and overall as well?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Simona, it's Tim. We did have an exceptional quarter with iPhone, and that was with the backdrop of not predicting the demand very well on the iPhone 7 Plus and therefore being in constraint on it through the quarter. If you look at the absolute number of upgraders, it was the highest that we've seen in any quarter. And if you look at the switcher number, it's the highest that we've seen in any quarter. If you look at the upgrade rate, it's similar to last year. However, I think the big asterisk \u2013 I share all this with you for transparency's sake. I would tell you that the way we look at this is in a quarter where you have a supply constraint, it's difficult to draw too many conclusions from it. But I wanted to share that with you anyway so you have the backdrop.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thank you, and then just one follow-up on China specifically. As your comps get easier this year, I was curious if you think you're going to be returning to growth in that region. And then just to give us the context, I know you talked about the 6% constant currency increase in revenue in Mainland China. But curious if you strip out the double-digit increase in iPad and MacBook and potentially the mix shift to the iPhone 7 Plus, I'm curious what underlying iPhone units did in Mainland China.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">That's a big question, and I don't have the answer in front of me. If you look at iPhone 7 Plus, it was the most popular Plus model that we've ever had. It set a unit record, so that I can share. In terms of how are we going to do, we don't provide guidance at the segment level. But sitting here today, for Q2, I wouldn't expect the year-over-year performance to be dramatically different than the year-over-year performance in Q1. The real comp really begins in the following quarter to a more significant degree, and we'll have to see how that plays out as we get closer to it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Thank you, Simona. Could we have the next question, please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">From Bernstein, Toni Sacconaghi.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Antonio M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes, thank you. I just wanted to better understand the upgrade rate dynamics. So I think iPhone units on a sell-through basis were up about 8%. You had an extra week, which gave you about 8%. I understand there were differences of the timing of the launch. So making all those adjustments, it looks like iPhone units were probably up low single digits. But, Luca, you alluded to the fact that your install base was growing double digits. So that would suggest to me that the upgrade rate, the upgrade percentage is actually declining.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And more specifically, I'd just like your broader perspective on how investors should think about upgrade rates. It looked like they peaked in the iPhone 6 cycle, and it looks like they've been extending \u2013 going lower. Replacement cycles have been extending over the last couple years. I think some of the U.S. carriers alluded to that as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So I'm wondering if you could step back and just talk a little bit more broadly about how investors should think about or what the trajectory has been over the last two years and how investors should think going forward. Do you believe there are opportunities for that upgrade rate to improve or replacement cycles to accelerate going forward? And what are some of the considerations we should think about?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I think it's a good question, a number of points that I want to make. Starting with the growth in the install base of iPhones, yes, it's growing strong double digits, and that's very good for us for a number of reasons, including the fact that it's a big driver for our Services business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">When we look at it geographically, I think we see different developments. For example, we felt very, very good about the unit growth that we had in many markets around the world. You've been quoting an overall total company growth rate. But when we look at a country-specific level, there were a lot of countries, I would say the majority of the countries, where iPhone units grew strong double digits, starting here in the United States, where for example, the fact that annual upgrade programs are becoming more and more popular is proving to be a positive for us. Same happened in a number of countries around the world, starting with Canada and Australia but also many places in Western Europe as well. Japan grew double digits in terms of units. So I think geographically we are seeing very, very good performance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">The point that I think I need to make when you think about upgrade rates, clearly, this issue of the strong dollar doesn't help us. Could we sell significantly more and significantly faster from an upgrade cycle standpoint in places outside the United States, where we've been forced to increase prices by up to 20%, 30%, 40% in certain countries? And you think about the impact that this is having on local demand, obviously that doesn't help us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">But overall, I would say as Tim said, when we look at the upgrade rate for and we look at it from the standpoint of the new phones, right, the new generation phones, the upgrade rate, the percentage of people that have upgraded to the new phone has been very similar to what we've seen last year. The 6 cycle was certainly a phenomenal cycle. There was pent-up demand for the larger screen phones. And certainly as we look ahead, we have a role to play. The more we're able to innovate with new generations of products, clearly that plays a role in the upgrade rate.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Antonio M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay, thank you. Tim, I have a question for you. Back in April 2012, you said on one of these earnings calls that I've always hated litigation and I continue to hate it, and I highly prefer to settle versus battle. Yet you recently decided to initiate a lawsuit against Qualcomm. I'm wondering if you can comment on the ostensible change or departure from this viewpoint, and what would be a successful end result of this litigation, and whether you can confirm whether there's any potential gross margin risk in the future as a result of this litigation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I feel the same way I did in April of 2012. I don't like litigation and view it as a last resort. And so you should take from our filing that we viewed it as we didn't see another way forward. They were insisting on charging royalties for technologies that they had nothing to do with. And so we were in a situation where the more we innovated with unique features like Touch ID or advanced displays or cameras, just to name a few, the more money Qualcomm would collect for no reason and the more expensive it would be therefore for us to innovate.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And so it's somewhat like buying a sofa, and you charge somebody a different price depending upon the price of the house that it goes into. Just from our point of view, this doesn't make sense, and we don't believe it will pass muster in the courts. In addition to that, as a part of their increasingly radical steps they were taking to try to hold up that model, they withheld $1 billion in payments that they owed us. And so we felt like we had no choice was the net of it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">In terms of where it goes, we'll see. I don't like litigation. And so if there's another way, then that would be great, but at this point I don't see it. I fully expect at this point in time that it will take some time, but in the end I think common sense will prevail and the courts will see it for what it is. And so that's the way I see it. Thanks for your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thank you, Toni. Could we have the next question, please?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">We'll go to Steve Milunovich with UBS.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thank you. First, I wanted to ask about the iPad. It looked like it was about to turn possibly even positive. You said it was above your plan, but I think it was pretty well below the Street's expectations. And the ASP deteriorated pretty significantly. I don't know if it's a mix shift. But maybe you can talk about the iPad and what you see going forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">The iPad, Steve, we had a 1.6 million-unit swing on channel inventory between the years. In the year-ago quarter we increased by 900,000. In this quarter we decreased by 700,000. On top of that and from an ASP point of view, in the year-ago quarter we launched the iPad Pro 13 Edge. That would be the iPad with obviously the highest price on it. We would have done the channel fill plus the launch of the product, and so that would have bolstered the ASPs in that particular quarter. In addition to all of that, we did under-call the number of iPads that would be in demand for the quarter, and that compounded a shortage issue that we had with one of our suppliers. And so all in all, there were quite a few things going on there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">If I zoom out of the 90-day clock and look at it, we've got some exciting things coming on iPad. I still feel very optimistic about where we can take the product. When we look at the number of people buying iPads for the first time, which is a good thing to look at from a point of view of whether things are reaching a penetration point or not, the numbers indicate that it's not close to that kind of thing. The customer sat numbers are through the roof. Literally, the customer sat for the iPad Pro is 99%. It's stunning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And so I see a lot of good things and hope for better results, but we are still currently in this shortage issue now, and I'm not projecting to get out of that totally during the quarter. And so it will damper this quarter somewhat. But again, beyond the 90-day clock, I'm very bullish on iPad.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay, that's great, thank you. And then, Tim, investors tend to think of the iPhone as mature and technology improvements as incremental, yet I believe you said there's plenty of runway left in terms of appealing new features. Do you think there are future enhancements coming that will be viewed as material by users, and particularly changes beyond form factor, beyond the way the phone looks? Are there functional things coming over time that you think could surprise people?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I think the smartphone is still in the early innings of the game. I think there's lots more to do. I think it's become \u2013 every year it becomes more important to people's lives and there are more things people are doing with it. I talked a little bit about home automation, but I could have talked about health. I could have talked more about CarPlay. The use of it in the enterprise is growing significantly. And so when I look at all of these things, usage going up, app developers still innovating, we've got some exciting things in the pipeline, I feel really, really good about it. So this is one that we think different about a bunch of things, but maybe this is just one more.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Thank you, Steve.
