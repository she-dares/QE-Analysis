My name is Dennis and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today, January 16, 2014. Thank you. Mr. Holmes, you may begin your conference.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Dane Holmes</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Today\u2019s call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm\u2019s belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain and outside of the firm\u2019s control.

For discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm\u2019s future results, please see the description of risk factors in our current annual report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended December 2012.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our investment banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk weighted assets and Global Core Excess. And you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that is posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com.

Harvey?</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thanks, Dane and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I\u2019ll walk you through our full year and fourth quarter results then I am obviously happy to answer any questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Let\u2019s start with the annual results. We had firm wide net revenues of $34.2 billion, net earnings of $8 billion, earnings per diluted share of $15.46 and a return on common equity of 11%. This is a solid result and a modest improvement over last year\u2019s performance despite what at times was a difficult operating environment. With regard to the fourth quarter, net revenues were $8.8 billion, net earnings were $2.3 billion and earnings per diluted share were $4.60.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">In looking at the broader operating environment, many of the global themes had dominated 2012, for example, improving economic debt in the United States, central bank activity and political uncertainty continued into 2013. Starting with U.S. economic data, we saw relatively consistent improvement over the course of the year reported GDP consensus estimates in each of the last two quarters. U.S. unemployment rate declined by over 100 basis points to 6.7%, it\u2019s lowest level since October of 2008 and housing prices as reflected by the Case-Shiller Housing Price Index increased by 14% through October. 2013 represented a slow, steady improvement in the U.S. economy, which had roughly a quarter of global GDP naturally served at a stabilizing and positive improvements on global market sentiment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">2013 was also marked by significant Central Bank activity. In Japan the Central Bank announced unprecedented monetary risk [ph] and was to achieve stated inflation targets. Japanese credit spreads tightened and the yen weekend throughout the year. In addition the Nikkei enjoyed it's largest annual game since 1972.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In the U.S. initial commentary from the Federal Reserve about tapering at bond buying program ultimately translated into a December announcement of a $10 billion monthly reduction in the reprogram leading the marketplace to contemplate the world without quantitative easing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Finally political risk and uncertainty were constant during the year, starting with the Italian elections in the first quarter, continued unrest in the Middle East and the 16 day U.S. government shutdown. This created an environment that requires qualities to constantly reassess their outlook for the global economy. For example what are the implications of Central Bank activity on the global economy? Individual regional economies and specific industry sectors? What are the pushes and poles associated with monetary policy versus fiscal policy? Rising rates and tapering a head win for the U.S. economic recovery or return to a more traditional supply and demand driven economy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Not surprisingly our client\u2019s activity fluctuated over the course of the year as they were constantly digesting new information. When you boil it all down the 2013 environment it's just one where the world took two steps forward followed by one step back. A dynamic which you could see reflected in both price movements in the markets and client activity. To sum it up while we wouldn\u2019t characterize the last two years as a normal cyclical environment given all the items I previously listed it shouldn\u2019t be lost on us that the long term trend is slowly and steadily improving.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Now I will discuss each of our businesses, in invest banking we produced fourth quarter net revenues of $1.7 billion up 47% from the third quarter. Three factors drove the increase, a robust IPO calendar, higher completed M&amp;A volumes and debt financing activity that remained strong. For the full year investment banking net revenues was $6 billion up 22% from 2012 on the back of solid underwriting activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Breaking down the components in investment banking advisory revenues were 585 million in the fourth quarter. The 38% increase relative to the third quarter reflects the increase in industry wide completed M&amp;A. Goldman Sachs continue to be ranked first in worldwide announced and completed M&amp;A for 2013. We advise on a number of significant transactions that closed during the fourth quarter including Vivendi, $8.2 billion sale of it's controlling stake in Activision. Ingersoll-Rand\u2019s $5.3 billion Allegion and a $2.9 billion sale off Saks to Hudson\u2019s Bay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We also advise on a number of important transaction that were announced during the fourth quarter including Sysco\u2019s $8.2 billion acquisition of U.S. Foods, ViroPharma\u2019s $4.2 billion sale to Shire and Deutsche Telekom\u2019s 2 million euro sale of Scout 24 to Hellman &amp; Friedman.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Moving to underwriting net revenues were record $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter up 52% sequentially at equity issuance improved significantly. Equity underwriting revenues of 622 million were more than double our third quarter results largely due to an increase in IPOs and convertibles. Goldman Sachs continues to be ranked first in worldwide equity, equity related and common stock offerings for 2013. Debt underwriting revenues increased 9% to 511 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">During the fourth quarter we actively supported our clients financing needs participating in Darling International, $2.7 billion debt and equity offering. Twitter\u2019s $2.1 billion IPO and Moncler\u2019s $1.1 billion IPO. Our investment banking backlog further improved from third quarter levels which you will recall were already at our highest level in five years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Turning to institutional client services which comprises both our FICC and equity businesses. Net revenues were 3.4 billion in the fourth quarter up 19% compared to the more challenging environment in the third quarter. For the full year 15.7 billion of net revenues were down 13% relative to 2012. FIC client execution net revenues were 1.7 billion in the fourth quarter or 1.9 billion excluding DVA losses of a 163 million. Excluding DVA, revenues were up 46% sequentially. In particular, currency revenues increased significantly compared to a challenging third quarter. Credit was up on stronger client activity that was supported by tighter credit spreads and solid issuance trends. Commodities revenues were largely flat sequentially and remains a threat by lower volatility in client activity levels. Rates and mortgages declined as client activity levels remained low.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">For the full year, fixed client execution net revenues were $8.7 billion or $8.9 billion excluding $220 million in DVA losses. Excluding DVA, revenues were down 14% relative to 2012 at macro uncertainty particularly around central bank policies and lower volatility levels impacted client risk appetite and activity. The decline was more pronounced for rates and mortgages.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In equities, which includes, equities client execution, commissions and fees and security services, net revenues for the fourth quarter were $1.7 billion, up 4% sequentially and included $43 million in DVA losses. Equities client execution revenues increased 9% sequentially to $598 million. Commissions and fees were $747 million, up 3% relative to the third quarter supported by rising equity markets and strong issuance trends. Security services generated net revenues of $337 million largely consistent with the third quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">For the full year, equities produced net revenues of $7.1 billion, down 14% relative to 2012. This decline was due to the sale of our Americas reinsurance business in 2013 and the sale of our hedge fund administration business in 2012. In our equity business during 2013, stronger performance in cash products was offset by weaker derivative revenues. Turning to risk, average daily VAR in the fourth quarter was $81 million, down from $84 million in the third quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Moving on to our investing and lending activities, collectively these businesses produced net revenues of $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of $1.4 billion, primarily reflecting company specific events, including initial public offerings and gains in public equity investments. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $423 million and benefited from net gains and net interest income. Other revenues of $234 million include the firm\u2019s consolidated investments. For the full year, investing and lending generated net revenues of $7 billion driven by $3.9 billion in gains from equity securities, $1.9 billion of net revenues from debt securities and loans and $1.1 billion of other investments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In investment management, we reported fourth quarter net revenues of $1.6 billion, up 31% from the third quarter primarily as a result of $333 million in incentive fees generated largely from the firm\u2019s alternative asset products. Management and other fees were up 5% sequentially of $1.1 billion. For the full year, investment management net revenues were $5.5 billion, up 5% from 2012 on stronger management and other fees, which benefited from growth in assets under supervision.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">During the fourth quarter, assets under supervision increased $51 billion to a record $1.04 trillion. This growth was driven by long-term net inflows of $13 billion largely in fixed income assets. We also had market appreciation of $20 billion largely in equity assets. On a full year basis, $41 billion of long-term net inflows and $40 billion of market appreciation drove these record levels of assets under supervision. When it comes to investment management, we all know that performance is critical. We are intensely focused on delivering returns for our investment management clients and have seen improvement in our multi-year performance. The $41 billion of long-term net inflows in 2013 were the highest annually since the onset of the crisis. We will continue to focus on delivering performance for our clients and have confidence that the rest will follow in due course.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Now, let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as benefits, decreased 3% to $12.6 billion for 2013 and translated into a compensation to net revenues ratio of 36.9%. Fourth quarter non-compensation expenses were $3 billion, 40% higher than the third quarter and up slightly compared with the fourth quarter of 2012. Other expenses were significantly higher reflecting net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings of 561 million more than 400 million higher than the third quarter. Depreciation and amortization included a 196 million impairment charges primarily related to consolidated investments. Finally the fourth quarter also included a $155 million donation to Goldman Sachs Gives our donor-advised charitable fund.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">For the full year non-compensation expenses were down 2%. Total staff at year end was approximately 32,900 up 2% from year end 2012. Our effective tax rate was 31.5% for 2013. Before moving on to capital it's worth taking a step back to review our improvement operating efficiency over the past few years. In the first half of 2011 we announced a comprehensive expense initiative. If you look at our cost structure this year versus 2010 before we launched our expense initiative. Total expenses are lower by $3.8 billion. As a result our pretax margin in 2013 increased a 140 basis points to it's highest level in the last four years, this despite having $5 billion less in revenues.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Delivering more operating efficiency is never easy and requires a real focus on striking the right balance. By balance I mean making sure that our actions positions us to deliver for all of our constituents. Our clients, our regulators, our employees, the broader financial system and of course for our shareholders. We believe it's early and ongoing focus on our expense structure has not only benefited recent performance but more importantly also serves as a basis for better results in the future particularly as the opportunity set expands.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Now regarding capital, we repurchased 8.5 million shares of common stock for total cost of $1.4 billion during the fourth quarter. For the full year we repurchased 39.3 million shares for a total cost of $6.2 billion. With respect to our regulatory capital ratios our Basel III Tier I common ratio on a fully loaded basis was 9.8% using the advance approach. Under the standardized approach our ratio was 9.2% of course it's important to note that our transitional ratios are both more than a 100 basis points higher. Risk weighted assets are on the advance approach are approximately $595 billion, $350 billion in credit risk, $160 billion in market risk and about $85 billion in operational risk. Our estimate for the proposed supplementary leverage ratio under U.S. rules remains approximately 5% for the firm and approximately 6% for the bank. These were our best estimates subject to change depending on regulatory clarifications.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Of course last month we also gained regulatory clarity on the Volcker Rule. Most importantly the final Volcker Rule explicitly permitted market making, lending and investing on balance sheets. Regulators permitted these activities given the essential that they plan supporting healthy capital markets and economic growth. Although we only received a finalized Volcker Rule last month. We have obviously been preparing to comply with certain portions of the rule for nearly three years. In 2010 we began closing down our proprietary trading operations, specifically Goldman Sachs principal strategies and our Global Macro Proprietary Trading desk.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In addition we announced in 2012 our intention to redeem certain hedge fund investments. Since 2012 we have redeemed approximately $2.2 billion of hedge fund investments and we will continue to redeem our interests. Now that we have a final rule the first thing that we did was established a Volcker implementation team comprised of senior leaders with expertise across a wide variety of controlling business functions. They are focused on making sure that we\u2019re in the position to effectively and efficiently meet the numerous requirements outlined under this new and intense compliance regime.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In summary as I mentioned earlier while we\u2019re still not at what I would describe that normalized cyclical environment, the underlying macro trend is being improving. To maximize our opportunity set and drive shareholder value we need to continue to focus first and foremost on our clients. Their activity and our connectivity to their needs is our highest priority. We need to continue to recruit and retain a high caliber and dedicated global workforce. We need to leverage our technology expertise to adapt to new regulations and evolving market structures and we need to remain focused on improving our efficiency both from a cost and a capital perspective. Our goal is not only to enhance returns in the current environment, but more importantly over the long-term to position this firm for significant operating leverage as the opportunities that improves. We believe that we have the competitive position, the diversity of businesses, the caliber of people and the institutional will to capture and maximize these opportunities as they present themselves for the benefit of you, our shareholders.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Thank you again for dialing in. And now I am happy to answer any questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p5\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">(Operator Instructions) Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with ISI. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Good morning, Glenn.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Good morning. Just a quickie follow-up. I heard all your comments on Volker just making sure the hedging component, you mentioned about market-making lending investment, anything different on the verb it\u2019s related to hedging in your ability to just manage risk across the desks?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">No. We don\u2019t see anything in the rule that prevents us from continuing to hedge. I think the early concern before the final rule came out with its reference to portfolio hedging, but we hedge within the business as there is no hedging at the firm wide level, so hedges are hedges.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Good, good. Also the Fed recently just put out a quick whitepaper that had a testimony on commodities, I think a lot of that was expected, but I am curious to get your update as to what\u2019s on plans for the business, but there was a piece in that that threw me for a loop a little bit on the merchant banking and I wasn\u2019t sure if it relates to your entire merchant banking business or merchant banking within commodities businesses. So, if you could get quick thoughts on that, I know it just came out, that would be helpful?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">No, fine. It\u2019s an important question. So, as you know, the commodity business has been an important business for Goldman Sachs and quite important for our clients for an extended period of time. I think to simplify it I would break down the business growing into two parts. There is \u2013 our activity there relate to investing activities. And then there is our franchise business where we are working with clients in a market-making activity. Then in that function, we are essentially providing the same services as anyone would, working with a Treasurer or a CFO on any risk that they would be hedging. So, in terms of a corporate treasurer, if they need to manage their exposure to dollar yen, they will work with us in our currency business. And if they need to manage their exposure to a cost input in commodities, they will work with us on the same hedging profile. So that\u2019s a high level as the business breaks down. And on the investing side, we\u2019ve been an important provider of capital and working with our clients to a capital intensive industry. I think it relates to the whitepaper, I think it\u2019s a good step. It\u2019s another step in the regulatory process, where people reviewing the businesses. I think the questions make sense. These are things that we consider all the time in our businesses from the safety incentive [ph] perspective. So I think it\u2019s a healthy exercise and we will work the regulators, but certainly no change in strategy from Goldman Sachs as it relates to commodity. It\u2019s just too important business for our clients.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">I appreciate that. The merchant banking component within that paper, it seemed to be chucked in at the end, is that questioning whether we limit bank holding companies\u2019 ability to do merchant banking in totality or it\u2019s within the commodity space?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Don\u2019t know. Don\u2019t have any special insight in terms of that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">I know it\u2019s early.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So we will see as it moves along. I don\u2019t want to minimize it, but it\u2019s a question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Glenn Sure - ISI</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Okay. Moving on to FEA, you guys have been doing this for a while, some banks are catching up. I am just curious on if more of the competition is accounting for the credit spreads and pricing, does that make the business on more equal footing, does it \u2013 is it that do you envision an impact on the actual pricing of the business than the competitive landscape?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">No. Obviously, there has been a lot of attention to FEA over the last couple of days just so obviously you are aware of this, Glenn, but we incorporated FEA into our pricing methodologies back in 2010. And if you take the step back for a second, just from the general risk management perspective in the way that we think about risk parameters and inputs, if we identify our cost or parameter we try incorporate as quickly as possible and so we adopted this in 2010. In terms of it's implications I think there is probably two one is really more for you and folks on your side of the table which is obviously it has some degree of distorting effect when you look at things like revenue market share and it's one reason why we look at revenue market share but we don\u2019t emphasize it as much as you do necessarily because these pricing inconsistencies they can lead to anomalies in certain points in time. I think the more important issue really in terms of how we run the business is the one that you have mentioned which is regardless of the particular assay class is, if one firm I say Goldman Sachs in this particularly case ends being the one from that\u2019s actually pricing our parameter and all the other competitors aren\u2019t. It leads to challenging conversations with the clients because you look like an outlier and so you know to get to the gut of your question the extent to which the playing field is level and everyone is pricing on the same terms and managing the risk the same way, obviously we prefer that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">But in the end we\u2019re always going to prioritize the risk management over things like market share.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">The question I get asked most often when I talk to clients about you guys is how you can improve the ROE over time? And you know to be fair the 11% for the year is above that appears especially if you adjust for the business mix but as we think about you know obviously revenue is a driver but if revenue stays kind of in this type of environment what can you do to optimize the capital and there is still some expense opportunities even after all the progress you\u2019ve made today?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So if you go back again a couple of years ago you know we really were focused on building operating leverage into the enterprise and I think in the end of last year you saw that reflected in the response sort of our performance with a 10.7% ROE and this year you\u2019re seeing increasing operating leverage but obviously it's important to see the back to back consistency. Now we\u2019re always looking to be more efficient. We can certainly do things you know far from corporate [ph] we can certainly do things in terms of capital efficiency and expenses and we\u2019re constantly looking at how to leverage technology particularly as we get more visibility into finalized rules so we can adapt. I would say you know my comments before about finding balance. As we have been doing this the most important thing is we want to make sure we\u2019re well positioned for our clients when revenue opportunities do look better and I think you see it kind of across the board in terms of market share and investment banking, reachable [ph] presence, growth and asset management all across of our businesses you\u2019re seeing it we will try to find that balance and look we always get these things right but that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">And I guess as a follow-up, this is just a general question for you and the industry that when people look at the fixed income environment I think there is a lot of focus in all the structural changes occurring and concerned that there will be revenue pressures but I also get the sense that there hasn\u2019t been maybe an entire adjustment to that franchise or to the platform as people wait to see what all the new rules are and kind of when Fed that of buying bonds what happens to that market? So I\u2019m just wondering like is that an area where there might be some capacity adjustments because if you see for the industry as a whole?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">It's a really good question; I\u2019m going to break it down in two part. On the first part in terms of the impact of regulation I think it's early you know we haven't even really seen the launch of things like swap execution facilities and the real impact is in ultimately how market structures adjust. I do think though that the big impact from a regulation perspective is the fact that the entire industry is carrying more capital and I think implicating [ph] in your question but you should correct me if I\u2019m not appearing correctly, it would appear that perhaps there is excess capacity in the industry. Now we have been building a lot of operating leverage into our fixed income franchise over the last couple of years and at the same time we feel very comfortable with our relative position in all of our businesses and so to the extent to which capacity comes out we think we will benefit from that in terms of our competitors exiting businesses but we will have to see. We\u2019re just focused on doing what we can with our opportunity set.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Good morning, Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Good morning. Thanks a lot. Maybe first question just getting back to the ROE given that you have more clarity on some of these rules, whether its RWA leveraged Volcker, you just spent a few years trying to kind of reposition the business. I guess what inning do you feel like you are in terms of repositioning? And then at some point, you sold some of the U.S. reinsurance business, I think the Europeans there, I guess some point you need to be able to either redeploy more than your earnings in terms of capital or are you seeing enough opportunities globally as the economy and the macro environment improves that you can start reinvesting to generate high returns?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So it\u2019s a great question. So obviously we have taken a number of steps over the past several years to in terms of selling businesses that because of rule changes were quite frankly just better held than other people and when you provide the proper return, then as I said going to the hood, we have been building in as much operating flexibility into, for example, our fixed income franchise as we can during this fortune environment. So I guess I would say with respect to capital first and foremost, we just want to make sure that firm is positioned safely and defensively and at the same time we can be offensive when opportunities present themselves, but it\u2019s really going to be determined by client activity, economic growth, confidence that will be the opportunity set and will just adjust. It will always be incremental. So you will see us make incremental steps. You have seen us take some move selling things, but you will see us make incremental steps, but really now, it\u2019s about that balance, because we don\u2019t want to forgo the upside.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just on the banking side, you mentioned pipeline remains strong. It feels like we are coming off a very strong 2013 just given particularly on the equity side and even on the debt side, but when you look at the outlook and you look at the conversations, is it possible to have multiple years meaning \u201814/15 with an improving economy, where the investment banking revenues are continuing to grow off this base and maybe partially it\u2019s because we had five years of pretty anemic activity in some areas. I just want to get your outlook is this some view that \u201813 was a great year and some spot and so the growth rate from here might be tougher?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">It\u2019s a good question. So if you sort of just think about our investment banking franchise and you break it down between let\u2019s just say underwriting on one side and advisory services, the merger business on the other. The underwriting activities clearly there is a market component to that in terms of tightening credit spreads people looking to put capital to work and then obviously you saw it in the fourth quarter a big uptick in equity underwriting, the market was there. The advisory business for a CEO making a decision on a merger, it\u2019s a career defining decision and against the backdrop. Again, go back and look at 2013, against the backdrop in one quarter you are contemplating what is tapering mean and then two quarters later, you are contemplating a government shutdown at that difficult backdrop to make a career defining decision. And so it\u2019s going to lack that client and you are going to see pickup in M&amp;A activity in sectors where you see global confidence and so not surprising to us at all and we have been very protective about franchise obviously a leading franchise.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Now, as it relates to some of the other markets like for example take the debt market, one thing I have learned in the past year, because I think one of the most frequently asked questions I got at the end of the last year was what is the debt underwriting looking like in the environment in 2013? I couldn\u2019t have told you that there will be as much activity as there was. We just respond to when we look to deliver for our clients in it. Now, you could paint a picture of a declining debt environment, but also you could see debt transactions of significant swing to mergers. We have seen some of that Europe recovery and a long-term shift to the capital markets, growth markets shifting more towards capital markets due to very long-term trends that are in place. Simple, we will say.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. And then just last question on FICC, you just I guess given some of the near term trends that we could see. I just want to get an update on how you see some of this transition of the OTC markets under these swap execution facility platforms, maybe we will get it mid-February you know who knows if it will get a delay but it seems like clearing was fine last year. I just want to get your sense on talking to client, talking to customers, is it progressing? So we don\u2019t have many hitches, little bit more challenging.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Sure I actually think the regulators approach and all the industry participants, clients, exchanges and clears I thought that the process of clearing I don\u2019t know if you give it higher marks. It was done in stages, it was very orderly. I think the issue with swap execution facilities obviously there is a big technology build and change in behavior across all of our clients and so the only thing I would say about and we will have to see what happens in February is I think that measured approach the clearing was quite thoughtful and I know there is lots of discussion about the approach you know the burden is on all of us to make sure that you know as an industry we adopt these protocols. A lot of burden obviously on swap execution facilities because they are the center of all this connectivity but clients need to be ready. It's hard for me to gage their preparedness but I think if it was staged and I don\u2019t mean extended but I think if it was staged and it mirrored the approach to clearing I think at the margin it just I don\u2019t know maybe it's just more prudent.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question is from the line of Roger Freeman with Barclays. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Roger Freeman \u2013 Barclays</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Can you just remind us what you think the obviously the market condition is depend on, what that with the realization profile looks like in terms of (indiscernible) I mean is this kind of, so a couple of three years of you know mature investments that we will see coming out?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So obviously and we talked about this over the course of the year, it's an environment that has been favorable for harvesting and so you\u2019re seeing that as we go through. We are also seeing interesting opportunities around the globe for investing but you\u2019re seeing the performance as it comes through.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Roger Freeman \u2013 Barclays</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">How should we think about the comp ration? You know it's probably it's not maybe is it explicit there but how do you think about compensation on those and how it's beneficial throughout the sort of managing compensation on the firm?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So absolutely no change to how we\u2019re thinking about compensation. First you know we manage the compensation across the firm it's a collection of businesses and pay is based on firm performance then we go into the divisions and obviously down to the individual and so obviously it's our largest expense. We spend significant time on it; I think you\u2019re seeing the benefit of you know some of the tough cost cutting that we embedded into the business over the last couple of years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Roger Freeman \u2013 Barclays</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And I guess one more and I know it was Volcker out of the way and now do you think you\u2019ve got enough clarity around all the rules, the capital requirements et cetera to step up investing on balance sheet again as the opportunity sets in there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">The short answer is yes but I would breakdown regulatory clarity from the opportunity set. The opportunity set is going to be driven by what we see working with our clients and being very disciplined about returns as we have in the past. In terms of the rules that, you know the rules that gives a road map or the various alternatives under which you can undertake the activities you can you invest with your clients in 3% funds, you can work with other Volcker compliant structures and obviously we can invest off our balance sheet. So but that speaks to how the when and working with clients that will be opportunity driven.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Roger Freeman \u2013 Barclays</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And secondly, you mentioned that you thought were still not quite in a normal cyclical cycle so I guess how far off do you think we\u2019re not time wise but just how much of an impact are these other things having and at this time what would you say the top 2 or 3 sort of issues are that are keeping you from saying this is within the balance of the cyclical norms.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yeah so what I was really trying to underscore there is some of the things I mentioned earlier, which is focusing on a shift from quantitative easing to tapering or the entire financial symptoms are adjusting to multi-year processes in regulatory reforms or a government shutdown. Again, things are not normal characteristics of a cycle. And so referencing the script is sort of supply and demand driven see really what are the fundamentals of the economy, what are the fundamentals of performance of companies, and that\u2019s really what I was talking about it, it maybe not the best score, but it\u2019s more of a return to sort of the normal day to day challenges. And as you have seen in the past, when there was economic growth in activity in a degree of certainty, our clients are willing to make significant decisions, commit more capital and we get to work with them and the activity levels pickup.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Roger Freeman - Barclays</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Gently, but the trend is slowly improving, steadily.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Roger Freeman - Barclays</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Really obviously just had a couple of weeks there at the start of the year, but how would you characterize client engagement so far?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Client engagement, we are very, very focused on our clients in terms of the first couple of weeks, way too early to extrapolate anything.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Roger Freeman - Barclays</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yes, okay. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Good morning Guy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thank you. Good morning Harvey. So on the I&amp;L obviously you had significant gains whether they were to the extent that they were realized or not in a sense that maybe it doesn\u2019t even matter, because given the IPO environment and the apparently very much improving M&amp;A environment, a significant amount of this probably will be over the course of the next year or so it seems to me. And so then the question is what\u2019s your philosophy with respect to capital return of discrete amounts like that? And do you think it\u2019s possible to make a case to the Fed that for significant freeing up of capital of despite it\u2019s not necessarily the right approach to kind of compare to earnings?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So it\u2019s a good question. I think the core of your question where you are saying is basically if risk is down. So the consumption of capital is lower and the demand for capital isn\u2019t there, the question is can we return or not return it, okay. Now, the way we will look at that question is first and foremost running with periods of excess capital is not a problem if we feel like we are going to be able to deploy that capital. We are never going to force that deployment. So first and foremost is going to be risk judgment about how we utilize it. If we say opportunities, where capital cannot be deployed and I will say for the long-term, for example, in our insurance businesses where the rules have changed, then we will look to return it. And we\u2019ll work with the Fed over time in the construct to return that capital, I am certainly not speaking for the Fed here, but I don\u2019t think any industry benefits from holding excess capital in the system for an extended period of time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">That\u2019s there. On Volcker, you mentioned that you have a very high level committee that\u2019s looking at implementation and the things that you need to do in order to implement it fully. As analysts should we be focused more on potential revenue impacts of that implementation or the cost of that implementation?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I think, well, clearly the cost structure issue is one need to focus on, because as I mentioned the compliance burden is pretty intent. I think the revenue again, one of the things in the rule obviously and I have to get the exact language, but basically you said that market-making activities effectively essential, because it promotes healthy capital markets. And so I think that the Volcker Rule is covered, we will have to see ultimately in the implementation what happens, but at least in the intent of the final rule that seems clear that they want to support capital markets. And so those revenue opportunities again are going to be predominantly driven by the opportunity set. That\u2019s all I think about it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Now, in terms of our implementation team, this is just kind of typical how we approach it just making sure that we have identified the right people across entire firm to make sure that we do it as efficiently as possible and then there will be a build, but at this stage, it\u2019s way too early to sort of quantify any ongoing cost structure for you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay that\u2019s helpful to get the philosophy of how you\u2019re thinking about those things. The term to revenue ratio as was mentioned earlier did come in lower for the year and you know to the extent that there was a significant revenue shift certainly in the latter part of the year, it seems to have been in favor of I&amp;L<strong>. </strong>Is 37% sort of a benchmark that we should be thinking about now for next year or if for example in 2014 revenue were similar but the composition was more traditional markets and investment banking and less I&amp;L, would we expect that comp ratio to be higher?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So that\u2019s a great question. It's way too early to tell obviously in terms of how we will think about compensation in 2014. It will be driven as I said before by performance and the performance will be driven by obviously the collection of businesses that we run. I think that the mix issue, I understand why you\u2019re asking the question but there is no single business or segment that drives compensation expense for Goldman Sachs and so you know for example if you had asked a question slightly differently you said listen let\u2019s just say I&amp;L everything else being equal and I&amp;L was down I would expect that means the performance of the fund is down it's obviously compensation expense would be down but at that point in time we will be incorporating all factors, competitive positioning, and this is we\u2019re building because while it's pay for performance for the year it's also investing for the long term.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Just a couple of housekeeping questions. I don\u2019t know if you have talked about the impact of the (indiscernible) sale on FICC revenues in the quarter I didn\u2019t see it in the release if you could help us with that, that would be good.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yeah sure no problem. So on a DVA adjusted basis sequentially and obviously we had a challenging third quarter in FICC, and got a lot of attention but sequentially DVA adjusted revenues were up 46% if you adjust for the sale of the European insurance business it's more like 30% it's roughly about $200 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And then final housekeeping type of question. You talked about the SLR being pretty much in compliance on an NTR basis. Have you had a chance yet to think about what the impact would be of adoption of the final Basel add-ons?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">No we haven't, we\u2019re still digesting the rule. As you would imagine under that paradigm obviously just because of the nature of our business it impacts our ratio more as a result of things like netting and collateral but we\u2019re still digging through the rule.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question comes from the line of (indiscernible) with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Just a follow-up on leverage with the question earlier on. Just in light of your relatively stronger position in there. Just given the lengthy timeline for implementation. You know as leverage becomes the binding constraint for your competitors. I would be curious in your thoughts on Goldman\u2019s appetite to be more aggressive or more aggressively compete for market share in client centric but balance sheet heavy businesses like prime brokerage.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">It's an important question, if you just split into two parts for a second on the first part we\u2019re not going to change or approach to risk and by the way the FDA was a good example earlier. We\u2019re not going to change our approach to risk management and how deploy our resources to the extent to which our competitors change their strategy. The other half of the question I think is the way you\u2019re asking which is for example if whatever the constraint is it does not to be the leverage ratio but if a firm is constrained, if our competitors are constrained in a particular business and we have relative strength in that business we would assume that we could be a more valuable provider to our clients on relative basis and that relative strength would just improve. I think that paradigm applies for everybody.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Exactly what I was asking. Thank you. On the compensation policy just given the importance of lower earnings volatility to the regulators and investment community. I was just curious for kind of updated thoughts on how the firms approach to managing the quarterly compensation accrual, do you anticipate quarterly comp accrual will be more sensitive to the revenue environment or should we expect the practice of a 4Q true-up to continue? Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So the practice of the 4Q true-up is just that we said competition we have full visibility into the performance of the business is. So again, no change in compensation philosophy, we actually think it\u2019s quite important to maintain our philosophy around compensation and for all of our employees at Goldman Sachs to understand it, understand our obligation to the firm and the context for the compensation philosophy ultimately obviously as the largest helmet of our cost structure we incorporate everything you would think we would put into that including our obligation to our shareholders.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Hey, good morning Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So I just wanted to follow-up on the full quick question, I know you have got a lot of that already this call. But in thinking about the I&amp;L I know you called out Volcker pertaining to TE into the hedge fund investments you got, but do I take that to mean that the other components of I&amp;L you don\u2019t \u2013 you are not constrained by Volcker, so the real estate piece is the credit piece of the loan funds?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">You are into a pretty intricate territory. So they have got [ph] rules of 900 pages. Right, and so I wasn\u2019t \u2013 what I was basically saying is I was bringing it down to some there is going to be 3% funds.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Right.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And there are going to be other Volcker structures, so for example, historically, the way people may have defined CLOs, you may have included securities and depending on the very intricate definition of the rules, you may not be able to include some securities. And so however the investing activity and working with our clients\u2019 needs to be structured, we are going to comply. I think that the Volcker Rule what it does is it outlines a set of rules where market participants can do that. Again, 3% funds, other covered structures and of course you can invest in line with our balance sheet, which is a pretty straightforward activity, but that\u2019s really what I was trying to emphasize. You really have to go to the rules they have to determine whether you can do real estate in a particular way or not and look we will comply.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Right. No, I get that. It\u2019s just that as you know and you get some good detail about the balances in I&amp;L and how they are broken down in a couple of different ways. So I mean, I think the Street is just going to be looking at that to understand how the capital is getting freed up and then reinvest in that space, because clearly, if there is reinvest, that would be great and that\u2019s not you want to see it bought back. So I was just wondering how you are thinking about disclosing the balances in I&amp;L, I mean, I guess I am just wondering to the degree you can put it in and then a Volcker, non-Volcker kind of disclosure that would be I think helpful for the Street?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So I think we have been pretty good in terms of disclosure around, for example, what the firm\u2019s investment in funds are, it is roughly $15 billion in less than a quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Right.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I think the investing process is going to be one again which is going to be driven by the opportunity set and what our clients want us to do. And so the decision of reinvest or return, we are going to continue to make the decision in the same way. If the opportunity set is not there, we are definitely not going to be a firm that\u2019s going to force investing. We are just going to be disciplined and if we don\u2019t take the opportunities, then we are going to look to return the capital. Now, you are certainly seeing the impact of those businesses in our capital ratios. We talked about things like the financial institution production in the past. And so there are \u2013 there is a lot of aspects to all the rules, not just Volcker, but I am actually 100% sure and I understand your question, so if we need to we connect with them afterwards and we (indiscernible) a bit more.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes, sure. Okay, thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Hi.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">How are you?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. So you guys have VAR kicked up here this quarter, it\u2019s actually kind of at the level we haven\u2019t seen in quite some time, could you walk through and help us understand what drove that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So really all driven by basically an overall decline in market volatility and then an increase a bit in positional risk, but that really is virtually all concentrated in equities as you would expect very active equity quarter, lots of activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. Was there any kind of positional tailwind for your equities business or should we think about this as all sort of solid flow revenue?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Usually it was solid flow revenue, when you do block transactions and it was a particularly active block quarter and I got to give credit to our team I think they did a fantastic job in executing blocks because it was a competitive environment. Those block transactions can be large so they will drive LIBOR [ph]<strong>.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And on the equities business this quarter certainly was better quarter but when you look back at 2013, and you adjust for the sale of the insurance business the revenues really are not all that strong and then kind of stand out on the street as rather week. Are you thinking about, how you\u2019re thinking about loss of share in the equities business and what you want to maybe do to try to counter that till you come up with strategies, what\u2019s your view there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">We are always focused on any area of the business that we can grow and deliver more value to our clients. I would say given our starting position in terms of just our aggregate division in the marketplace, in terms of whether it's prime brokerage, underwriting, the derivative business, our cash business. You know one of the pretty significant position in terms of aggregate market shares. So you know we\u2019re trying to get back to these earlier issue of all revenues aren\u2019t created equally and so I completely understand you\u2019re focused on quarter to quarter changes in revenues. We\u2019re focused on delivering over the long term and it's not that we don\u2019t look at it but there is risk in these revenues and so you really have to look at the entire set of metrics and how it's our pretext margin looked versus other people\u2019s and how are we driving ROE. So we feel very good about our franchise position.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay and that\u2019s fair, well we have only blunt tools so we use the tools we got. And then last one for me, litigation expense we saw you know a pretty big uptick certainly when we include many of the money center bank competitors that\u2019s being a big theme the last few quarters. It definitely feels like this is something we should probably count on the near term, are you do you guys feel as though you\u2019re part of that scrum and how do you feel about your reserve for litigation? Have you had a chance to build it up? Do you feel like you might be a little bit behind the bond upfront, should we count on some build here for the medium term here? Can you give us some color on that? I know it's a hard one.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">This is a very, very important question because all firms in this particular case are not created equally. The way I think for us and the entire marketplace this is our best estimate, so every quarter really no different than mark to market accounting. Every quarter we do our what is basically the best estimate in that particular quarter and we add to the reserves. Now we also obviously disclose a reasonably possible loss which you saw most recently at the end of the third quarter but this is a quarter-to-quarter activity. It is not a budgeted forward looking activity. We incorporate all the information set that we have at this point in time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And do you have a view on where your year-end potential losses above you know reserve levels will shake out or how that will change versus your last reported number or is it too early to know on that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">No again this is not a budgeted, if I knew at the beginning of 2014 that my estimable and probable number was 962, sorry at the end of 2012 I would have taken 962 in the first quarter. So I would encourage you to go in the financial statements if you look at our reasonable possible loss that\u2019s a good disclosure item which was $4 million at the end of the third quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question is from the line of Michael Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Michael Mayo \u2013 CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I\u2019m still not sure on the answer to the Volcker Rule and I understand it's 900 pages, there is lot of work to be done but you know one of your competitor said it should not have a material impact and we can all come up with our own estimates what the impact of Volcker might be on you guys but can you just give us some range like it should impact our revenues you know from X to Y percent or expenses from Y to Z percent or size it to some degree?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I thought I was clear [ph] in terms of the revenues that at this stage it doesn\u2019t look like a revenue impacting items since the Pablo<strong> </strong>but of course we\u2019ve already (indiscernible) other businesses early on in the process and made changes. And so I don\u2019t think the primary issue at this point in Volcker is about revenue impact although we have to see how regulators ultimately digest all the data they are requesting etcetera. And with respect to the compliance costs that I mentioned, it\u2019s just too early to quantify, but there is a pretty extensive compliance regime.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Michael Mayo \u2013 CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. And as it relates to VAR, to what degree are you deliberately taking more risk, I think your predecessors used to say we want to live to fight another day as far as risk of mentality, it seems like maybe you are taking a little more risk in equities, but not necessarily elsewhere or what\u2019s your risk stance?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So I think my predecessor also would have said we will never deliberately take more risk. It\u2019s just not the way we are going to run the enterprise. It\u2019s all activity driven. So that\u2019s why I emphasize the equity number picking up during the fourth quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Michael Mayo \u2013 CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. And for the year revenues were flat even with much higher stock markets even with gains in investing and lending. So when you look out looking for revenue growth, where do you think that can come from?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So look I think the most important thing for us this year was how we found that balance in terms of achieving the 11% ROE and at the same time continuing to drive operating leverage. We feel very good about franchise position in an absolute sense, in a relative sense. So I am certainly not predicting the future, but as economic activity picks up, confidence picks up, capital markets around the world, particular regions. I think you could certainly paint an optimistic picture, but I want to be clear I am not doing that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Michael Mayo \u2013 CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. And what is the ROE target for Goldman?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yes. Thanks for asking the question that way, Mike. Yes, I understand this is an important issue for all of you and we are getting increasing clarity around the world sets, although the sale a fair bit too dull. When we put out an ROE target, I think first and foremost, we wanted to be credible and we wanted to be achievable. And so when you hear from us that\u2019s what it will be. Now, between now and then, no one should get off this call thinking that we are not exquisitely focused on how we are deploying our capital and how we are focused on returns and how we are thinking about returns to our shareholders. So that was the target point today, Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Michael Mayo \u2013 CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">No, I understand. But I mean when do you think you will have a target? When do you think you have enough clarity around the capital rules to highlight an ROE target?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t predict the ultimate visibility into the rules they had and what it means for markets, but when we have \u2013 but we know it\u2019s important to you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Michael Mayo \u2013 CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Alright, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Thanks Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yes. Hey, good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Hey, Jim.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Hey. First question on equity derivatives, you mentioned that it was significantly lower this year versus last year, I guess that volatility is down, but the market environment was pretty constructive and typically lower utility means little more risk taking. So was there anything unusual this year or I should say last year in terms of derivatives that was so much weaker than \u201812 how should we think about that going forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">No, there was nothing in there. I think you are just seeing the natural tos and fros of client activity and markets, but there is no single item I draw your attention to.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. And then maybe on the capital side, you guys highlighted about a 60 basis point difference between the standardized and advanced approach, do you envision that converging over the next few years and what would be the major drivers?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So, as you know the standardized approach really is in (indiscernible) not as risk centric and so that\u2019s not something that we had focused on as much. So things like collapsing derivative notional, which is a good thing to do for managing operational risk. So it\u2019s really something that we are starting to focus on now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Because you are going to \u2013 the Fed wants you to report the lower of the two, right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yes, well both.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Right.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Now, of course, under the transitional rules as I mentioned, we are north of a 100 basis points higher anyway. So we are going to get fully phased in numbers which we have a couple of years on.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Right.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Jim, from your perspective, I wouldn\u2019t consider it as a significant issue.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay, fair enough. And lastly on compression credits [ph], do you view that as a material benefit for you guys going forward? Do you think its early stages and still a lot of room there as it\u2019s sort of more in the margin?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So it\u2019s early, but certainly the rule set, but that\u2019s an example of where a rule set comes out and rule set gets behavior and in this case you are starting to see the behavior and I would think you continue to see a pickup momentum.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question is from the line of Fiona Swaffield from RBC. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Fiona Swaffield - RBC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Just a clarification on the moving parts on the Basel III look through the 9.8 which seems pretty static. Could you talk us through I think it's given the RWA number but in the last quarter the deductions moved quite significantly and I thought they might continue to do so. Doesn\u2019t look like much is happening there and also is there some operational risk inflation? I think it's marginal but I do remember a number being a bit lower than that six months ago. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Sorry can you just say the second half of the question Fiona?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Fiona Swaffield - RBC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I think you said a number of operational risk weighted assets of 85 billion I\u2019m not sure I got it, I think that\u2019s slightly higher. I\u2019m just trying to understand why the RWA is not going down a bit more with the natural roll-off?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay so with the type of ratio there is a lots of give and get under the hood and one of the biggest drivers as you know since the final rule came out has really being the financial institutions deduction, well significant and non-significant and so that was really the most significant change in the final rule which drove it but you know for example we picked up a benefit on the sale of the European insurance business of 20 basis points but that was then offset by other risk factors. So they said it's a fair bit happening under the hood.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Fiona Swaffield - RBC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And is it right that on operational risk weighted assets it's trending slightly up, is that an offset of the roll-off of\u2026</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yeah I know that\u2019s correct slightly higher and as you know operational risk, RWA they are slow moving and they are sticky.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question is from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Just a couple of housekeeping related items given that we have gone through most of the important questions at this point. In terms of the fixed income inflows that you highlighted in your prepared remarks I guess I\u2019m just curious if you can provide some further color on why those inflows were so much bigger than some of the other areas given you know most people\u2019s view that rates are going to be going higher and that presumably that means investors would be thinking about moving money into less rate sensitive areas.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yeah so I think it's a pretty straightforward answer, there is two parts. One is just about differentiated performance in fixed income and also there were funds that we have that are unconstrained fixed income products which you know are giving investors the flexibility I think and give us a more dynamic ability and managing the rate environment but really performance driven.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And I guess let me follow-up on prior question talking about your opportunities. How do you think about the revenue opportunities over the next couple of years across your geographic regions, I guess broadly speaking U.S., Europe and Asia? Is the greatest opportunity in the U.S. given some of the confidence we\u2019re getting relative to the economy or some of the trends you were talking about that we have been hearing about for a long time in terms of fixed income issuance, in Europe finally moving out of the banks and into capital market.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Yeah so quite frankly hard if not impossible to predict but with respect to our position and our commitment we feel quite good about how we have deployed the resources and how we have made adjustments of the resources during this portion of the cycle. You know for example we have maintained a very strong commitment to Japan. Well certain of our competitors have decreased their emphasis on Japan because you know as I referenced in my comment, the equity market haven't been in deep levels since 1972 and so we feel well positioned to capture the opportunity. Now importantly it's not about any individual region but it's the connectivity across our businesses and ability to connect for example our investment banking clients with resources in institutional client services, our securities division where we can deliver solutions globally. In Asia, people are looking to raise capital and it woo [ph] the U.S. investors that\u2019s really where you get the synergistic leverage across the enterprise.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And I realized question about the backlog has fraught with issues but presumably if you were at a five year high in the backlog three months ago it's grown a little bit since then as of year-end. You\u2019ve seen very strong improvement in IPOs, IPO issuance. M&amp;A looks like it's building, is the composition of the backlog now moving more towards M&amp;A and less from equities and fixed income?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">No there is not a huge shift in terms of mix although there were some adjustments certainly quarter, but what you are really seeing is and this might have been hard to predict at the end of the third quarter is replenishment, because it\u2019s pretty active fourth quarter. And so to the extent which it\u2019s a leading indicator it\u2019s obviously a positive one. And I do think it reflects as I said earlier sort of global sentiment if you will in confidence and our corporate client base, but look that could change.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay, thanks for taking my question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Steven Chubak - Nomura Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Hi, good morning Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Hey, Steven.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Steven Chubak - Nomura Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So I had a question regarding the investment considerations, particularly as it relates to Volcker on fund related investing versus direct balance sheet investing. So fund-related investing largely limited, direct balance sheet investing appears to be permissible, but I didn\u2019t know if it is apparently are the IRR or at least investment considerations meaningfully different between the two?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">No. So IRRs are IRRs, we don\u2019t adjust for the vehicle, if you will in terms of how we deploy that capital. So we would never allow, what do we call the term discipline to be corrupted by the particular vehicle in choice. I do think that the capital treatment can vary obviously as we talked about the financial institutions deduction and the money we have in front which obviously have to come out anyway. It\u2019s quite significant, but the risk gets captured in any number of metrics. It will be in the capital ratios, it\u2019s obviously stressed under CCAR. So it\u2019s not a vehicle choice.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Steven Chubak - Nomura Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay. Well, I actually had a follow-up to that. I didn\u2019t know if you could disclose the RWAs attached to the other $45 billion or so of I&amp;L investments that I suppose aren\u2019t \u2013 that are in fact Volcker compliant?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Yes. I don\u2019t have that number, but you are welcomed to follow-up with Dane after the call.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Steven Chubak - Nomura Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay. And do you happen to have the number of further financial institution deduction for which is roughly $8 billion last quarter, I didn\u2019t know if it was roughly around that same level?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yes, it\u2019s up a bit since the third quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Steven Chubak - Nomura Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay. And just last one for me on the leverage ratio, I didn\u2019t know if there is a specific target that we should be contemplating longer term. So assuming that the 5% ratio are mandated level is the binding constraint, is there some sort of buffer that we should be contemplating on a go-forward basis?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">We haven\u2019t given where we are in terms of the proposed rules obviously. And as you know, our philosophy on these things is given the regulators have provided an adequate glide path we will wait to see the final rule, before we will adjust any aspects of our business. And ultimately, you will see us run with a buffer, but we haven\u2019t invested any energy in that yet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Steven Chubak - Nomura Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yes, that\u2019s it for me. Thank you for taking my questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Thanks so much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And your next question is from the line of Christopher Wheeler with Mediobanca. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Christopher Wheeler - Mediobanca</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yes, thank you. Good morning. Couple of questions. The first one is on something that\u2019s philosophical this morning in the FT after your former partner\u2019s testimony yesterday to the social committee, where you mentioned that the European bonus cap was something that wasn\u2019t the most appropriate magnet of managing bonuses. Can you talk a little bit about how you are dealing with that issue, because obviously the FT is running with the view that New York is a much more attractive place for people to be (indiscernible) given this bonus cap? I am just wondering about what you think the impact might be in terms of increasing fixed compensation. I know I think you said it\u2019s not too many people impacted, but have you had to make or will you have to make too many changes in respect of this?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">No. Look it\u2019s more in the context of the firm. Obviously, Europe as a region is critically important to us strategically. So we are very committed to our clients there and our people there. And so no, we will work with the regulators and we will comply accordingly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Christopher Wheeler - Mediobanca</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay. And the second question really is really a follow up on I think what Guy and Betsy have been asking, but I am trying just to get really clear my mind about the capital allocation to I&amp;L and how you are thinking about that from the planning perspective? It seems to me that where this perhaps when would be a couple of years ago the thought was that you are going to be reducing capital, because obviously Volcker was going to force you out. It sounds to me like you have no clear view at the moment on reducing capital in that business. It\u2019s maybe the fact that you will naturally spin off some capital and you will leave it very much depending on the state of the markets to whether you actually lead it in I&amp;L or whether you actually move it elsewhere in the business where you can get high returns, is that a fair way of describing things?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">So with respect of capital coming out of the business obviously the Volcker Rule is very definitive on what we need to achieve. So early on as soon as we identify that as a likely finalized rule item we announced the reduction in our hedge funds. In terms of some funds will just low off depending on the opportunity set but obviously we\u2019re committed to complying with the rule and that\u2019s not optional.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Christopher Wheeler - Mediobanca</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yes but what I\u2019m asking is, it sounds like where capitalist is thrown off, you\u2019re perfectly happy to absolutely (indiscernible) rather than deploy it elsewhere in the business if you see the opportunity. It's not sort of fixed and concrete but you really want to reduce the amounts of capital in your principal business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay I\u2019m sorry I understand the heart of your question now. We don\u2019t think about capital allocation in other words we\u2019re going to deploy an explicit amount of capital to I&amp;L because it's all return opportunity set client driven, so we will be happy to redeploy that capital if it's best use for in another part of our business and if necessary we will look through return on capital.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Your next question is comes from the line of Douglas Sipkin with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Douglas Sipkin \u2013 Susquehanna</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Just two questions one maybe just on the outlook for headcount growth. I guess year-over-year about a flattish year I think net adds about 200. Any feel for what you guys are going to be looking to grow that or sort of keep it steady state right now based on the environment that you\u2019re seeing in front of you right now?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">So no plans for any significant changes, if you dig under the hood a little bit the headline numbers sort of match some of the efficiencies we build. Obviously we talk about that in terms of the build out of for example our Salt Lake City office et cetera and how we\u2019re leveraging technology and people and kind of what I will call the pyramid if you will around the organization but there are no significant plans one way or another but it will be dynamic. If you see growth opportunities then you should expect to see us add if we need to and then if the environment is less favorable we will make other adjustments but it will be dynamic.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Got you and with respect to the asset management segment obviously you guys have had some positive progress there. I know you guys have done couple of small sort of it feels like opportunistic acquisitions, you know given how the capital model of the firm is changing you know would you guys consider something doing something bigger in asset management on acquisitive side? Is it presented itself given sort of the favorable capital/returns that business provides in the new world?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I think that, the business itself has been a huge strategic priority for us and you know what you\u2019re seeing is not the, it's not the result of a quarter\u2019s performance. You\u2019re seeing a multiyear commitment to the business which is you know now starting to show some differentiated yield. In terms of opportunity set look if there are opportunities that are accretive with Goldman Sachs or business and our clients you should expect us to consider anything.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Devin Ryan - JMP Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">So I just have a question on the FICC business. I asked a similar question last quarter but we have now seen outflows out of bound, mutual funds in 29 out of the past 31 week. So I know the number is pretty small in the absolute but just given that your FICC business is more institutional in nature, is that something that maybe you\u2019re paying closer attention to now that the trend has picked up some more steam and are you actually seeing any change in client behavior as a result of that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">So no change in behavior that then I would come in touch with. You know the behavioral changes have been more response to the news dynamic during the course of the year. The issues that I talked about you know what does tapering mean versus QE? What are the government shutdown mean? Those were the kind of things that were little paralyzing at times for clients I think as they contemplated the implications. Obviously over very long periods of time fund flows have an impact potentially in the short one they can when there are dramatic controls [ph] whether it's in the matter with those bond funds or equity flows but I don\u2019t think yet we\u2019re seeing any major change in behavior.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Devin Ryan - JMP Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">And then just a question on comp, can you give any color on the mix of cash versus restricted shares and whether there is any meaningful change from last year in terms of how you thought about that and then just more broadly what the competitive environment, feels like today they recruit and retain talent maybe relative to a year ago?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">No. So we don\u2019t disclose details on the competition there, but you should rest assure that for all \u2013 for everyone that they are \u2013 that is participating, that is receiving equity that maybe there are long-term restrictions on that. And we believe that just basically aligns the broad employee base interest with our shareholders and that\u2019s been historically the case. Now, we thought about it for a long time. With respect to talent, we have seen some tailwinds in the ability and this isn\u2019t recent, but certainly the last year and a half we have seen the ability to acquire talent when needed. And so now having said that, our people are always highly pursued also, but that\u2019s not a new phenomenon.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Devin Ryan - JMP Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Great, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">And this concludes the Q&amp;A session. Please continue with any closing remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">So just want to thank everyone on behalf of the team here for dialing in. We look forward to seeing you during the course of the year and if we don\u2019t see you in the next couple of weeks, we will certainly catch up with you on next quarter\u2019s call. Thanks again everybody.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs fourth quarter 2013 earnings conference call.

(NYSE:<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GS\" title=\"Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\">GS</a>)</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Q1 2014 Earnings Conference Call</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">April 17, 2014, 09:30 AM ET</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Executives</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Dane Holmes - Head of Investor Relation</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Harvey Schwartz - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Analysts</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Glenn Schorr - ISI Group</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Mike Mayo - CLSA</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Steven Chubak - Nomura</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Brennan Hawken - UBS</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning. My name is Dennis and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. This call is being recorded today, April 17, 2014. Thank you. Mr. Holmes, you may begin your conference.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Dane Holmes</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm's belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain and outside of the firm's control. The firm's actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our current annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 2013.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our investment banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk weighted assets and global core excess. And you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that is posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">This audio cast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Our Chief Financial Officer, Harvey Schwartz, will now review the firm's results. Harvey?</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thanks, Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I'll walk you through our first quarter results. I am obviously happy to answer any questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Net revenues were $9.3 billion, net earnings $2 billion, earnings per diluted share were $4.02 and our annualized return on common equity was 10.9%. The first quarter reinforced two consistent themes that we have seen over the past few years. First, the continued uncertainty around the strength of the global economic recovery; and second, the dominant role that central banks play in driving broad economic activity and capital market sentiment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">With respect to the first, market participants struggle to reconcile mixed economic data across different regional economies that weigh the prospect of a strengthening U.S economy against an improved, but still relatively weak European economy and a slowing economy in Asia. As it relates to the second theme, discussions among market participants are also centered on the potential for additional central bank activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">In United States, the focus remain on the pace and potential magnitude of further tapering to the Federal Reserves bond buying program. In Europe, the market attempted to weigh the potential for either negative interest rates or the introduction of an asset purchasing program. In Asia, market participants questioned whether the upcoming hike in Japan's consumption tax would weaken positive momentum and require the Bank of Japan to boost its quantitative easing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Given the uncertainty surrounding the outlook for central bank activity, it is understandable that overall client sentimental risk appetite was subdued. With this backdrop, we are all reminded of the importance of a strong and diversified business. With respect to the client franchise at Goldman Sachs, we continue to see strong relative positioning and performance across all of our businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Within investment banking, we maintained our market leading position in completed M&amp;A. We advised on 31 value transactions, valued at $1 billion or more, the highest number in the industry. We helped underwrite $55 billion in global equity offerings during the quarter, making us the market leader. We also helped to bring a $194 billion of high yield and investment grade debt offerings to market, which is a quarterly record for debt underwriting volume.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Within investment management, total assets under supervision reached a record $1.08 trillion, up 12% over the past year. Despite market headwinds, our performance within FICC demonstrates the benefits of offering our clients a diversified product suite, meeting their needs across rates, credit, currencies, mortgages and commodities. Whether it's from a business, products or regional perspective, the value of diversity was reinforced in the first quarter of 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Now, I'll discuss each of our businesses. In investment banking, we produced first quarter net revenues of $1.8 billion, up 4% from the fourth quarter. This was our highest quarterly performance since 2007. While investment banking backlog declined from yearend levels, it is up significantly compared to this time last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">First quarter advisory revenues were $682 million, up 17% sequentially. We advise on a number of significant transactions that closed during the first quarter, including Vodafone's $130 billion disposal of its U.S. group, whose principal asset is its 45% interest in Verizon Wireless. Cole Real Estate Investments' $10.9 billion sale through American Realty Capital Properties and Bristol-Myers Squibb sale of its global diabetes business to AstraZeneca for up to $4.3 billion, plus future royalties.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We also advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the first quarter. These include Safeway's $9.2 billion sale to an investor group, led by Cerberus Capital Management, Hutchison Whampoa's $5.7 billion sale of a 25% stake in A.S. Watson to Temasek and Foster Wheeler's $2.9 billion sale to Amec.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Moving to underwriting. Net revenues were $1.1 billion in the first quarter, down 3% compared to record fourth quarter results. Equity underwriting revenues of $437 million was 30% lower, as industry-wide activity declined in the first quarter, particularly for IPOs. Year-to-date, Goldman Sachs ranked first in global equity and equity-related common stock offerings in IPOs. Debt underwriting revenues increased 29% sequentially to $660 million due to higher issuance activity in both investment grade and leverage finance markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">During the first quarter we were committed to meeting our clients' diverse financing needs. Whether it was McKesson's $5.5 billion bridge loan and $4.1 billion investment grade notes offering or Hong Kong Electric Investments' $3.1 billion IPO or X2 Resources' $2.5 billion private placement.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Turning to institutional client services, which comprises both our FICC and equity businesses, net revenues were $4.4 billion in the first quarter, up 31% compared to the weaker fourth quarter. FICC client execution net revenues were $2.9 billion in the first quarter. Excluding DVA, net revenues were up 50% sequentially.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Rates and mortgages were both up significantly relative to the weak forth quarter, although client activity and volatility remain relatively muted. Credit improved slightly and was supported by stable credit markets. Commodities revenues improved significantly relative to a weak fourth quarter, as market volatility and client activity increases. Currency was modestly lower sequentially.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Equities includes equities client execution, commissions and fees and security services. Net revenues for the first quarter were $1.6 billion. Excluding DVA, results were down 7% sequentially. Equities client execution net revenues, up $416 million, were down significantly due to less favorable market condition in certain areas, including emerging markets in Asia, particularly Japan.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Commissions and fees were $828 million, up 11% relative to the fourth quarter on solid cash volumes. Security services generated net revenues of $352 million, up 4% sequentially. Turning to risk, average daily VaR in the first quarter was $82 million, roughly consistent with fourth quarter levels.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Moving on to our investing and lending activities. Collectively, these businesses produced net revenues of $1.5 billion in the first quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of $702 million, primarily reflecting company-specific events, including divestitures and pending IPOs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $597 million and benefited from net gains on certain investments and net interest income. Other revenues of $230 million include revenues from the firm's consolidated investments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In investment management we reported first quarter net revenues of $1.6 billion. Management and other fees were roughly flat sequentially at $1.2 billion. Incentive fees were largely driven by performance fee related to the sale of an investment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">During the first quarter, assets under supervision increased $41 billion to a record $1.08 trillion. This growth was driven by record long-term net inflows of $40 billion, largely in fixed income assets. During the quarter, long-term net flows were strong across each of our client distribution channels, institutional, high net worth and third party. During the quarter, we also had market appreciation of $14 billion, largely in fixed income and equity assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Now, let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as benefit, was accrued at a compensation to net revenues ratio of 43%, which is consistent with the accrual in the first quarter of 2013.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">First quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.3 billion, 24% lower than the fourth quarter and down modestly from the first quarter of 2013. The fourth quarter included higher litigation and regulatory expenses, higher charitable contributions and higher impairment charges on consolidated investment entities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Total staff at the end of the first quarter was approximately 32,600, down 1% from yearend 2013. Our effective tax rate was 32.7% for the first quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In terms of capital, there are a number of items to cover. First, during the quarter we repurchased 10.3 million shares of common stock for a total cost of $1.7 billion. These repurchases reflected the completion of our 2013 capital plan. As previously announced, the Federal Reserve did not object to our revised 2014 proposed capital actions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">With respect to our regulatory capital ratio, the Federal Reserve has approved the firm to come off the parallel run. And therefore, starting in the second quarter, our capital ratios are determined under the transitional provisions of Basel III. As a result, the transitional ratios are not only the most relevant, but also a better assessment of our risk-based capitalization.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Our Basel III common equity Tier I ratio on a transitional basis was 11.3%, using the advanced approach. Under the standardized approach, our transitional ratio was 10.9%. Risk-weighted assets under the advanced approach are approximately $600 billion, $355 billion in credit risk, $155 billion in market risk and $90 billion in operational risk.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Let me make a few brief points on the supplementary leverage ratio. Given that the proposed rule hasn't been finalized and won't take effect until 2018, to date, we have not taken any significant actions. When we have a final rule, there are multiple options that we can pursue.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On the capital side of the equation, our regulatory capital levels benefit from a natural tailwind over time as we comply with the Volcker Rule. As you know, we have investments and funds, where we invest alongside our clients. Under the Volcker Rule, we are required to significantly reduce our level of fund investments, which currently creates an approximately $9 billion capital reduction.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">With respect to the asset side of the equation, there are also steps we can take if needed. For example, as of yearend, we had over $260 billion of asset associated with secured client financing activities. These are generally lower-risk collateralized assets. We can ultimately decide if needed to reduce the lower returning portion within these balances.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Regarding the new proposal, our best estimate today is 4.2%, including the capital impact of reducing our fund investments to comply with the Volcker Rule, we estimate it would be 4.7%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">To sum it up, we feel confident about our ability to comply in advance of 2018, given the variety of actions that we can take. And we look forward to working with regulators to pursue the goal of enhanced safety and soundness, while continuing to serve our clients and support economic growth.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Before I take questions, let me leave you with some closing thoughts. Our performance in the first quarter is reflective of the ongoing challenges facing the broader marketplace, as the global economy continues its slow recovery. This is being counterbalanced by the continued strength and diversity of our global client franchise.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">A sluggish, yet steady improvement in the global economy should drive greater confidence and the durability of the recovery. In response, we would anticipate that market sentiment would improve, which should ultimately drive from our client activity and greater risk appetite.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">And the management team, we're focused on two primary goals. First, to focus the bulk of our resources on serving our clients and in the process grow our single-most valuable asset, our global franchise.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Our second goal is to take a disciplined approach to adjusting and reengineering our businesses, so that we are well-position to protect returns in the current environment, and more importantly maximize returns, when a more favorable environment emerges. Simply stated, the goal is to consistently provide superior results for you, our shareholders, across the cycle.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Thank you again for dialing in. And now, I'm happy to answer your questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p4\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">(Operator Instructions) And your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with ISI Group.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI Group</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">So taking a look at I&amp;L and maybe we should only focus on the equity side because I think most of the debt in lending will stick. At last look there was about $20 billion in there, $16 billion of it private equity. And given that you reiterated the $9 billion of disallowed -- this is a question, sorry. I'm assuming that you had some realizations in the quarter, but market list still has you at the same level of equity. I'm going somewhere with this, because I'm curious to see how you go about winding that down and getting in Volcker compliance over the next couple years and what the backup plan is, if you don't sell it off? In other words, can you spin some off? Sorry for the long question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">I understand. That's obviously an important question, Glenn, thanks. So I think the right way to think about the Volcker compliance is, if you look at the K, we roughly had at the end of 2013, $14 billion of investments in funds. Now, we're obviously coinvested with our clients in all those funds, and those funds are not just private equity, they are private equity, real estate, debt funds, et cetera. And the important thing is really to focus on the $14 billion now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Obviously, there is a process where we can apply for extensions for two years, which basically takes us out three years in terms of compliance. But just to size it for you, I think it worth breaking down the $14 billion. And so if you start with $14 billion, you can immediately take off $2 billion, what I'll refer to as permitted investments, that brings you down to $12 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">And then, you can take off another billion that relates to investments in fund that we're already in a process of redeeming, hedge funds and credit funds, where we have the flexibility to manage our own time path there. And so that takes you down another billion bringing you to $11 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Now within the $11 billion, obviously, for several quarters we've being in a harvesting mode and within the $11 billion, $2.5 billion is already public, but there maybe restrictions on sale down, et cetera. So when you add up all that math, the $14 billion at the end of last year, brings you down sub-9. And so the sub-9 is the number, we really have to manage. And again, we're investing alongside our clients in these funds.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI Group</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Moving on just a clean-up question related to CCAR. Your plan wasn't objected too, you got tons of capital and you keep producing more, so all those are good things. I'm curious to see, why you think you were so far off from the Fed in both PP&amp;R and R&amp;R and RWA. And I'm not agreeing with the Fed's projections, it's just, you had the biggest distance to the Fed and I'm curious on how you decompose that knowing that you don't have all the answers just yet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So that's an important question. So we obviously submitted a plan that we thought was significantly stressful and you can see that in our year-over-year numbers. We don't -- as you know, the Federal Reserve by design has created a process that is not transparent. They've communicated that very clearly. So it's difficult for us at this stage to reconcile our results with the Federal Reserve's results.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We'll obviously work with the Federal Reserve and the material they publish and we'll participate in their forums actively and we'll try and get better insights. I think an important takeaway here is, we certainly as a market participant, we're not encouraged necessarily to replicate their test.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">And so in the end they're regulator, we're the regulatee. And so if they see that their results are more severe than ours, it guides the process. And I think this window for modifying your capital actions, is a good part of the process, which we obviously participated in.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI Group</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">And last one is you've been able to put up ROEs in 10%, 11% range in an environment that I think you all would describe maybe a 5 out of 10, overall. So with your cost take out and your share count shrinkage, I'm assuming do you feel like you could do better than that over the cycle. I'm not necessarily forcing you for a goal over the cycle, but just curious to get your thoughts on what you can do in a little bit better times?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So over the last several years, as we talked about, we've been focused on a number of strategic initiatives, things like, obviously, growing our asset management business, and very focused as you know, on cost reduction and that really is strategically about building operating leverage into the business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">As we've done that through this part of the cycle, we've done it with an eye on finding the right balance, and by balance I mean is, we're obviously running these businesses for years and decades. And so as we're getting more efficient in creating operating leverage, we need to make sure that we protect that franchise. And I think this quarter's results really showed that diversity and the strength that our franchise, whether you're look at investment banking, asset management et cetera.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So I think we found that balance, the right balance so far. Now, if we were to get significant tailwinds and a pickup in activity, we're very confident that we would participate in that significantly. So there is a lot of operating leverage in the enterprise. And with respect to our ROE, again, on an absolute basis, it's not what we want to be able to produce for our shareholders. But on a relative basis, it looks pretty good.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Just going back to the Volcker on the equity exposure. So you went through, how do we should think about the $14 billion running-off over time and addressing that, but I guess how quickly and how big you rebuild the direct investment book that I think is still Volcker-compliant?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So it's not as much about speed of rebuilding. And as you know, we've never approached capital deployment about speed. It will all be driven by opportunity set. So that's the way we think about all of our businesses. As capital will comes out of those funds, it can be redeployed and obviously can be redeployed anywhere or it can be return to the shareholders, if we don't think the opportunity set offers the best. So over time, this would be completely driven by the opportunity set.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So if you had to take a guess, looking out, I don't know three, five years, does the overall equity book get back to about where it is here or I would think a little smaller, but maybe not a lot smaller?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">It'd be impossible for me to say. Again, there will be maybe opportunities that are more driven by the real estate cycle versus others. And I don't know, my crystal ball barely works for a week. It definitely doesn't work that well for three or five years. But I wish I had one that did.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">And then just on the comp ratio, looking out the rest of this year. I think last year you changed up a little bit. You kept it steady in the first half and then brought it down a little bit in 3Q, and brought it down again in 4Q. Just any comments on how you're thinking about the timing of phase-in of the comp ratio??</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So as always, in this quarter, it's our best estimate for the year. And we'll evaluate it as we go through the year. And again, really the philosophy in compensation hasn't changed at Goldman Sachs since the day I got here. It's all going to be again the process driven by performance of the firm, and business units and the individuals, and obviously our management of expenses and the returns we want to provide to shareholders. But right now it's our best estimate.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Your next question is from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Harvey, given all the debate around the cash equities market structure and the role of high-frequency trading, just curious to get your updated thoughts on transfer to electronic trading business, particularly the future of the Sigma X platform?.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So we've been obviously an active market participant in the dialogue. Gary Cohn, as I'm sure you saw, published an op-ed several weeks ago. Our focus on the equity market structure isn't specifically around high-frequency trading necessarily. It's really about the fact that over the last 10-years plus, the market evolution, speed of execution has just gotten ahead of the market infrastructure and the market plumbing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">And so we're very focused on working with all market participants and regulators to ensure that the market infrastructure catches up with the speed. And there is other things in Gary's op-ed that I will refer you to, but that's the primary message. With respect to our own Sigma X platform, I know there has been some things in news. We have no strategic plans for Sigma X at this stage.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Jut switching over to FICC. Just curious as to what happened to the credit business. Your commentary on a year-over-year decline, kind of contrast with peers while speaking to strength there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So obviously from a debt underwriting perspective, I know your question was specifically about credit, but from a debt underwriting perspective very strong quarter for us I think by any measure, breadth of transactions as I highlighted and certainly relative to opportunity in the marketplace. In terms of any one quarter and credit, I have no insight into the competitors. It's been like a reasonably solid quarter for us in credit, so there really are no major takeaways there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">First question. I think you gave like some updated numbers around SLR, and I just want to make sure I understand. I know before there was sort of that estimate of greater than 5, but the rules weren't finalized. I guess now you're just in, you got the finalized or mostly finalized rules 4.2, but if you got out of some of those funds you get to 4.7. And I just getting from 4.7 to above the 5, just if you could mention like some of the things, obviously there is earnings power, you mentioned some of the repo part of the business, but I just wanted to understand kind of what's the map in terms of getting there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So if I wasn't clear, let me just clarify. So the 5 wasn't that move to 4.2. The 4.2 was a reference to the proposal that just came out, which incorporates the larger denominator. And we've done, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we've done nothing to mitigate that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And as you know, our strategic philosophy on proposed rules is to engage actively in the dialogue with the regulators, but more importantly, we really won't look to mitigate until we feel like we have visibility around the final rule. Because we just don't want to mitigate things, and quite frankly do them in error. So we have done nothing to mitigate it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">The reason I highlight the natural tailwind, as I refer to it, is under the Volcker Rule, the $9 billion have to come out of funds. And that is a dollar-for-dollar capital deduction. So just standing still, we would move to 4.7. But we haven't specifically begun to articulate a strategy internally to get us to 5, but this gap is not material for us at this stage to be extremely focused on it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And, then, I guess when you combine the CCAR process and then with some of the other regulations like Volcker, there is obviously some constraint on payouts for everyone. When you think about the other opportunities, so investing in the business, making investments, but on the other hand managing the risk weighted asset side of the equation, are there starting to be more opportunities to invest versus payout? And as the economy improves, does that pick up? Just want to kind of get your sense on the balance there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">That's a great question. I think the one word that you used that, I think should resonate for the whole marketplace, not just Goldman Sachs, is this notion of constraints. And so every firm will be managing to whatever constraint they perceive. Within that really how do you fundamentally manage your capital? And at this particular stage, we're not feeling constrained. Obviously the 11.3%, Basal III ratio I referenced gives you some sense of potential excess capital.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">I think that this, it's an important industry discussion, because obviously for Goldman Sachs, but again the broader industry, the first priority is always about safety and soundness and adequate capital. But I do think that the flip side is there is a risk to excess capital in the system.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And what we're doing is no different than we would have done in the past, if there is periods where we're running with excess capital, we're going to be patient and disciplined and wait for opportunities. And certainly we're in a position today where from a liquidity and capital perspective if there is demand from our clients, we can meet them.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And then last one. Just on the fixed side of the business, you comment a lot on the quarter-over-quarter. When we look at year-over-year, and you have given that, at least on the OTC side you've gotten your clearing kind of in place and you were starting on the electronic side or the self-side. Just wanted to get your sense, I know it's difficult to piece those changes versus the broad environment given a lot of the volatility and the uncertainty out there. But maybe just from client conversations, how that's progressing and where you see that pan out?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I think if you look back over the past year, I think clearing certainly manage by the marketplace and the regulators extremely well. I know there were lot of concerns going into it, but I think the multistage launch, really I have to give everybody high marks for that. Swap execution facility is now up and running, still relatively new, so a bit early to tell, but at this stage, really no significant impact in the marketplace. And again, we'll watch it evolve and its impact with market structure, but really nothing to discern at this stage of any materiality.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Can you talk more about the non-comp expense? I know that's been a focus of your, and it certainly came down a lot, how sticky is that decline?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So at this stage, Mike, as you know, several years ago, we launched the cost reduction initiatives. And so that was a series of steps, which brought us up to just under $2 billion. At this stage we're still being at the margin, very focused on costs throughout the entire system. And so the sequential decline, as you know was obviously litigation. So that's not the mover, but the focus really is about again keeping cost significantly subdued during this part of the cycle, and again at the same time positioning us for an upturn.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So are you still looking to have these non-comp expenses decline down year-over-year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yes. As I said, at the margin, we're very focused on expenses in this part of the cycle and in areas where we can get positive results, you should see them.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">A separate question, the 2% buybacks were nice, perhaps you could do even more. And the threshold for the SLR is $700 billion in assets. And I guess you're above $900 billion. But is there any scenario where you would say, let's reduce our assets to below $700 billion, so there is less regulatory burden on the firm?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">No. There's no plans strategically to shift the size of the balance sheet in any way to get underneath some regulatory threshold. However, there is tactical things we can certainly do with the balance sheet, which I mentioned in my prepared remarks, which gives us some flexibility. And I think, for example, for any market participant if balance sheet becomes a constraint, I think there are elements of the balance sheet that either can be repriced as we move through the cycle or can certainly get smaller.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I've asked this question on several calls, but do you have any published financial targets as of right now?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yes, Mike, and I always appreciate your focus on this. There is no targeted ROE. And as I said earlier, at this stage, what we're really doing is strategically finding the balance point with this part of the cycle to make sure that we position the firm for growth, we provide you, the shareholders, with adequate and hopefully superior relative returns. And in the future, we're going to look to take advantage of all the market opportunities as the cycle improves.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Well, as a key, should I be looking at the proxy? I'm looking at Page 38 of the proxy, and you have the long-term incentive plan and that's based on ROE and growth in book value per share. So should I take that as an indication of what you're most focused on? But then on Page 33, I guess the Compensation Committee reviews results of Goldman versus peers, and it's a laundry list of ROE, EPS, earnings, revenues, comp ratio, non-comp expenses, a couple of other items. So what are you most focused on, if I'm looking at financial metrics?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So any day of the week, as a firm, we're most focused on serving our clients and growing our activity levels. In terms of aggregate financial metrics, all the things that you'll see in the proxy, whether its book value per share, ROE, those are all components into the compensation methodology, as are those other things that are mentioned in the proxy, whether it's our focus on expenses and aggregate performance, but those are part of our long-term incentive plan. I wouldn't view those as specific metrics as it relates to how we think about our capital.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Lastly, at what point do you think you have enough clarity to be able to give us financial targets?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I think, Mike, that we'll continue to communicate our message in a way that we think is appropriate for the context. Right now, obviously, there's still a significant amount of runway in finalization of rules. And as we get more clarity, we will continue to communicate with you how we think about capital. But I'm not sure necessarily having a published target is necessarily the best way to think about how we're managing the franchise, but we'll continue the dialogue, I'm sure.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">A couple of ticky-tacky questions. One is on the I&amp;L revenue line. I was just wondering if you can give a little more color around how much was driven from the monetization of the investments. And you're basically looking to understand how that contributed to the higher incentive fees in the investment management?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So the equity line was driven by a portion of the portfolio, which as I referred to as divestitures and IPOs. And the deadline is really investment-related gains and interest income. And obviously to some extent, you'll see it in the broader market this is a solid harvesting environment. And so you're seeing us do that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And did it have any implication for the incentive fees in investment management or not?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">As I said, the incentive fees this quarter, obviously largely influenced by a single asset that was sold. Again, I would put them more in the bucket of it's a harvesting environment. And so if we have performance, you're going to continue to see incentive fees.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And then the $8.5 billion that you're going to be managing down over time, I mean your clients went into these funds with an expectation of typically 10-ish years or so. But you're not beholding to that timeframe if obviously there's opportunities to extract value early?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So a number of these are older vintage funds. Obviously, we had some visibility on the Volcker Rule, when it was first launched. And so we have obligations to our clients. But again, we'll work with the regulators and continue to harvest the funds in the profile that I gave you. The clients obviously value these returns.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And then just on the Basel III, the transitional numbers we got. I'm just wondering if you can you give us a sense of what your fully phased-in number is, since that's what we've been looking at for a while?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">9.7 on the fully phased-in. But I would remind you again that we have to have the capital coming out of the Volcker funds. And so the transitional measure is maybe the best indicator.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And then that 9.7 is standardized or advanced?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">9.7 was advanced, I thought that that you're asking about, and standardized is 9.3.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And then just lastly on the SLR. You walked through how the Volcker is going to be benefited? Can you give us a sense of how the CCAR would benefit as well?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I think around Goldman Sachs, now we refer to that as CCAR by the way, but I'm not sure that's in the marketplace yet. So we've looked and if we've studied it at the margin, it could in the neighborhood of 10 or 15 basis points. But we're still digging through the details of that. But it's a tailwind too.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So it just a follow-up on the last question. So you gave us fully-phased. The 4.2 on SLR, that's a transitional, is that correct?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">No. That would be a fully phased-in, if you will.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And the increase to 4.7 would just be completely static if you were out of the $9 billion or sold funds today without any other change?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes. We stand still. We do nothing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And then you'd to add that 10 to 15 bps for the CCAR potentially just on top of that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Look again, early days on the CCAR -- and by the way, I'm glad you've adopted the CCAR acronym already. The early days, I think studying the CCAR, so that's why I didn't mention it earlier. But obviously I'm happy to give you a range on it. But the $9 billion that comes out, that comes out. CCAR is obviously a tailwind too.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I just wanted to make sure that we sort of put them all in one place and then it was clear that they're all in the same basis?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">That's correct. And that would give you 4.8 or 4.85, if you will.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Moving back to FICC, I know you don't usually disaggregate, but it would be helpful maybe this time around, because we've seen such diversity of results among some of the different players. If you could give us some color on a year-over-year basis on the divergence that you saw between macro businesses like rates and FX versus credit and commodities, and the more numbers you can help us with, the better?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I think the takeaway from the FICC business this quarter is really given them the market backdrop we had, where sentiment was really fluctuating. We had concerns about Asia growth and then political events. I think it really reinforces that if you're going to be in these businesses, you really need the diversification.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And so as we mentioned, the quarter was helped by commodities, because we have a strong commodities business and you saw in certain segments, really unusually strong volatility. So we had opportunities to work with our clients. We just don't look at it on a quarter-to-quarter basis. We look at in a multi-quarter basis. And in this particular quarter, you saw us outperform.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And just a follow-up question on the commodities. Was that mostly within the energy complex, where you saw the greatest strength?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So that's where the primary volatility was.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">You flagged in the release, the investment banking pipeline, the backlog was down, which is a first time I remember as anyone doing that in a long time. And I'm curious, is that just because of the underwriting calendar or do you sense that M&amp;A is also kind of out of peak and backing off?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">No, it was down. That shouldn't be a surprise. You may remember, Chris, that backlog had hit a post-crises high in the third quarter, then it hit another post-crises high in the fourth quarter. And obviously, the fourth quarter tends to be more of the build quarter and then coming-off of relatively strong quarter, and it wasn't down significantly towards yearend.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I think more importantly, I've made two observations. One that's specific about the backlog, which I mentioned is up significantly versus the first quarter of last year. But I think the takeaway on M&amp;A is an important one. We've now seen a couple of quarters with higher M&amp;A notional volumes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And so these things can all change quite quickly, but right now it does feel like it's an environment where we're far enough away from the epicenter of the crisis, where CEO competence is at a point where strategic transactions are occurring and there is an important takeaway about the nature of the transaction, which is some of them are very large.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And when you have a large transaction environment, I referred to the 31 transactions we did in excess of $1 billion a quarter. Large transactions can have, they won't always, but they can have a catalytic effect, either on the industry or they create subsequent transactions themselves. So again, it could all change on a dime. But right now this trajectory for merger activity feels pretty good. And obviously, over time that feeds a lot of other activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I guess, that's what I was getting at. Everybody is looking for an M&amp;A cycle. And in your view, it's alive and well and that's not the reason for the decline in the backlog?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">No. The level of engagement and conversation is quite good. And then again, look, again I referred to my crystal ball earlier not being great, but right now it feels pretty good.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And then switching gears, the easiest line of your income statement to predict a last couple of years has been the investment management business, because the AUM was always $850 billion and there was always a $1 billion base management fees, I think going all the way back to 2008. And all of a sudden, we're seeing a significant amount of inflows and AUM are up nicely two quarters in a row, what's happening there? And what should we expect? And what's different?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">We've articulated this in the past. Obviously, this has been a strategic growth area for us. And it really has been about, it's a bit old fashion, but it's been focused on performance, delivering for our clients and having differentiated performance. And when you look at our historical multiyear numbers, it looked like strong. And so you're really starting to see the inflows.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Nothing beyond that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Because there has been some small bolt-on acquisitions, which were disclosed, but this is really the core drivers' performance, particularly in fixed income this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Steven Chubak - Nomura</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So Harvey, you made a very interesting point regarding the SLR tailwind from the sale of Volcker assets. Looking at the metrics and where they stand today, assuming that SLR will remain binding, the elimination of the disallowed assets will provide a meaningful boost to the numerator, which will help both your risk and SLR ratios.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">However, the capital relief from any additional shrinkage in I&amp;L, I presume it will impact the denominator exclusively, which if SLR is binding actually incentivizes as you're engaging more risk intensive activities. So should we expect that you'll boost your permissible I&amp;L investments as you optimize the ROE opportunity that you currently see based on the capital constrains as they stand today?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I think we should be really clear on this. In no way shape or form are we going to let the regulatory guidelines or ratios or constraints encourage us to change our risk taking philosophy or how we deploy our capital. I can't underscore that more strongly. We often make mistakes and we're far from perfect, but as a firm, our risk culture focused on mark-to-market and our philosophy has served us well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And we're certainly, as I said, not going to be influenced by metrics that would maybe encourage risk taking. Quite frankly, we would always rather deploy this capital into our franchise businesses and we'll do that as opportunities present themselves.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Steven Chubak - Nomura</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And just one more from me. The Fed in ANPR published earlier this year, suggested that it would consider imposing some tougher restrictions on merchant banking activities, whether via more punitive capital requirements, restrictions on holding periods, what have you. I recognize this is really in the very early stages, but can you help us think about how your business or the merchant banking operation could adapt if tougher restrictions are imposed? And what level of I&amp;L assets would be classified as merchant banking x those, which are disallowed under Volcker? Really just trying to identify what could potentially be exposed?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">It's very early in that process. And so I have no discrete insights for you. We'll obviously participate and have participated in the Federal Reserve's AMPR and it will be an evolving process. Again, I think the fundamental takeaway for you to consider and the way we approach these things, is if needed, if you had outcome that restricted our abilities, we would weigh that outcome and our ability to drive value for that capital. And if we felt, we couldn't drive value for that capital, then we would look to return it to the shareholders. I think it's that simple.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">You've seen it too before in things like our insurance business in Europe and our reinsurance business in United States, and that's the length that will evaluate all of our capital opportunities. But, obviously, we'll discuss this as we get more clarity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Coming back to the commodities, solid results for this quarter, certainly encouraging. Maybe can you talk about your commitment to the physical side of the business and whether or not you think that a regulatory surcharge on that business could make it still economically viable for you all?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">It all depends, obviously, on the outcome. We don't have any visibility into the outcome. But again, it will depend on whether or not regulatory constraint is too high bar. I think more importantly today, as you know, we have a long history in the commodity business, providing our clients corporate treasurers and asset managers around the globe with hedging solutions and access to the marketplace and liquidity, not unlike we do in the corporate bond market.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And separately, we feel we provide value in providing debt and equity capital to the investing side of the business. But it will evolve over time and we'll adjust accordingly. But it's a bit of a wait and see.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Have you seen any impact in that market as some high profile editors have announced plans to exit or sell or what have you?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">This is an important business to us, because it's important to our clients. I don't want to read through too much of this, because it's only one quarter and I think it's hard to extrapolate anything from a quarter. But certainly in commodities this quarter, in certain sectors, the feedback we're getting from clients is that, there may be, and again I have very limited visibility into our competitors businesses, but there just maybe some benefit to those market participants that stay strong in commodities like us, by those that are deemphasizing or exiting, particularly when the market is volatile.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Can you speak to trends of MD and partner headcount over the last few years maybe across the firm and by division?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Obviously, as I mentioned earlier, we've been very focused on cost. We continue to drive efficiencies throughout the organization, in terms of non-comp expenses and obviously also in people. But I don't really have any specific color for you, in terms of by division, et cetera. Obviously, we're managing those resources in the context of the business activity that the businesses are seeing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I was just trying to get a sense, the shift to a more pyramid structure that you guys have referenced in the past.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">This is a partner year for us. So it's been two years since we made partners. And so obviously, we'll be grinding the entire organization through that process this year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And then the last one, just sort of in reference to this $9 billion that you've chatted, where we discussed a bunch here and the dollar-for-dollar capital hit in I&amp;L. Does your experience this year in sort of [indiscernible], which I certainly recognize as positive, trying to shrink the equity base? But does that make you a bit nervous about potential friction in returning that capital and the possibility of trapped capital for a while here as I&amp;L shrinks?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">It doesn't. This year, again, there was a difference in outcome between our results and the Federal Reserves results. We obviously thought we submitted a severe test and the outcome was more severe. Again, I think this process of giving firm the opportunity to adjust, I think it's a good one and it provides us in the marketplace all the flexibility. So again, I have to believe, again, in my opinion only, so discount it as you will. I have to believe, we'll be able to return excess capital over time for the exact reason that excess capital on a sustained basis for any industry, I don't think is a healthy thing. But again, that's just my opinion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Just two quick ones. You obviously spent some time today talking about the ratio at the holding company. Just curious if you could update us on the SLR ratio at the bank level, if that's materially changed from or materially different from what you were talking about maybe a quarter ago?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So, again, I think what we should just do for the purpose of this conversation is, ignore the last quarter and I'll just focus on the supplementary proposal that's out there, because I think the proposal is probably more relevant for your work. And that number in the bank would be 56.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And are there any other mitigating actions you can take within the bank relative to what you talked about in the holding company?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I haven't focused on it. But obviously, there are lots of things that go into the supplementary leverage ratio. So it's not a primary concern.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And then you mentioned, and I'm sorry, if I missed it, but you mentioned in the equities trading side of things, the particular strength in cash in the first quarter. I guess I'm just curious if you could give us some color in terms of the trends in the equities derivatives and PB businesses?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">You can't really read anything, I don't think into one individual quarter. But I think that this quarter in particular was probably in some respects tougher for our client-base than the headline indices would read just in terms of their ability to drive performance. But again, the equity business, to be a leading player, you really have to be strong in all facets of it, which means the prime brokerage business, you have to have a strong research footprint, you have to be able to drive IPOs and secondaries, and obviously you got to be able to commit capital, that's very important, and obviously you have to have a huge commitment of technology. And so, right now we feel quite good about things.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">But in terms of the client activity levels or risk appetite, it sounded like that was a little bit lower than maybe the headlines would have suggested across your non-cash equities businesses?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So if you look at our commissions and fees line, you can see it's up year-over-year and sequentially. But I would say, again, for certain segments of the client, client-based asset management, in particular for example and some of the headwinds, I think it was a tougher quarter for them. But I haven't studied all the full results. That's what I would expect to see.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And at this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So since there are on more questions, on behalf of the team, I'd like to take a moment to thank all of you for joining the call. Hopefully, I and other members of senior management will see you in the coming months. If there are any additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to Dane or the team. And otherwise, please enjoy the rest of your day. Look forward to talking to you soon. Take care.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining today's Goldman Sachs first quarter 2014 earnings conference call.

My name is Dennis and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today, October 16, 2014. Thank you. Mr. Holmes, you may begin your conference.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Dane Holmes</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. Today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm's belief regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain and outside of the firm's control. The firm's actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our current annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 2013. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets and Global Core Excess. And you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that is posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">This audiocast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Our Chief Financial Officer, Harvey Schwartz, will now review the firm's results. Harvey?</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thanks, Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I'll walk you through our third quarter results, then I'm obviously happy to answer any questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Third quarter net revenues were $8.4 billion; net earnings, $2.2 billion; earnings per diluted share, $4.57. Core to our strategy over the past few years has been a consistent focus on strengthening our relative position within the industry. Our success begins with a fundamental approach of engaging our clients, understanding their challenges and then addressing their needs. That is the foundation for expanding the breadth and depth of our existing relationships and the basis for building new ones.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">For the first nine months in 2014, revenues are 1.4 billion higher than this time last year. The increase reflects the combination of greater client activity in certain businesses and a strong market position. For example, as client activity picked up in global M&amp;A, you saw an increase in our market share. Our global market share in announced M&amp;A for the year-to-date of 29% is up 300 basis points compared to 2013. Our volume advantage to our next closest peer is more than $100 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We have also been focused on making sure that we are well positioned to deliver operating leverage as client activity increases. In 2011, we announced an operating efficiency initiative. This initiative was subsequently increased twice and ultimately reached nearly $2 billion. We continue to expand upon that prior initiative to grow margins and increase returns. The benefits of those efforts are demonstrated in our year-to-date results. We had 1.4 billion of incremental revenues and nearly $1 billion of incremental pre-tax earnings. Ultimately, the embedded operating leverage contributed to an improvement in our year-to-date annualized return on common equity to 11.2%. We have also achieved this result by being a prudent allocator of our global resources. Getting this right not only drives positive results for our clients, but also for our shareholders.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Now let me take you through the quarterly results for each of our businesses. In Investment Banking, we produced third quarter net revenues of $1.5 billion, down 18% compared to a strong second quarter. Importantly, our investment banking backlog increased again during the quarter, reaching its highest level since 2007. Third quarter advisory revenues were 594 million, up 17% from the second quarter on an increase in completed activity. Year-to-date Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced and completed M&amp;A. We advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the third quarter, including Hillshire Brands' $8.6 billion sales to Tyson Foods, InterMune\u2019s $8.3 billion sale to Roche Holdings and Gates Corporation\u2019s $5.4 billion sale to Blackstone. We're also an advisor on a number of significant announced transactions. For example, we\u2019re advising on TRW Automotive's $13.5 billion sale to ZF Friedrichshafen, Siemens' $7.6 billion acquisition of Dresser-Rand and Corio's \u20ac7.2 billion sale to Kl\u00e9pierre.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Moving to underwriting. Net revenues were 870 million in the third quarter, down 32% compared to record second quarter results. Equity underwriting revenues, up 426 million, were 22% lower sequentially as industry wide activity decline in the third quarter across secondary offerings. Year-to-date, Goldman Sachs ranked first in global equity and equity related and common stock offerings. Debt underwriting revenues decreased 39% from a record second quarter to 444 million due to reduced activity particularly within leverage finance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">During the third quarter, we remained committed to meeting our clients' diverse finance needs, whether it was Alibaba\u2019s $25 billion IPO, Sysco\u2019s $5 billion financing in support of its acquisition of US Foods or ADP's $1.6 billion high-yield offering.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Turning to Institutional Client Services. Net revenues were $3.8 billion in the third quarter with FICC Client Execution of 2.2 billion and Equities of $1.6 billion. ICS includes a one-time $270 million gain related to the tender of a portion of our trust preferred security. Excluding the fixed portion of the one-time gain in DVA, FICC Client Execution net revenues were $2 billion in the third quarter, down 11% sequentially. Mortgages declined quarter-over-quarter as clients were less active amid a relatively stable backdrop of prices. Credit declined significantly as increased volatility, wider credit spreads and lower issuance provided a more difficult backdrop. Currencies, interest rates and commodities were all higher sequentially as volatility and volumes generally increased from relatively low levels.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">When you exclude equities portion of the one-time gain in DVA, the results within this segment were as follows. Total Equities net revenues were $1.5 billion, down 10% sequentially; Equities Client Execution net revenues of $372 million were down 26% quarter-over-quarter reflecting lower net revenues in cash products; commissions and fees were 745 million, relatively flat with the second quarter; securities services generated net revenues of 343 million, down 8% sequentially from the seasonally stronger second quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Turning to risk. Average daily VaR in the third quarter was 66 million, down 14% relative to the second quarter, mostly driven by interest rates.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Moving on to our Investing &amp; Lending activities. Collectively they produced net revenues of $1.7 billion in the third quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of 876 million, primarily reflecting company specific events including IPOs and net gains in public equities. For example, one of our investments, Mobileye went public and our investment generated 285 million in net gains during the third quarter. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were 606 million and benefited from net gains on certain investments due to asset sales and net interest income. Other revenues of 210 million include revenues from the Firm\u2019s consolidated investments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In Investment Management, we reported third quarter net revenues of $1.5 billion. Management and other fees reached a record 1.21 billion. During the quarter total assets under supervision increased $8 billion to a record $1.15 trillion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Let me quickly walk you through the long-term flows. Long-term assets under supervision had net inflows of $13 billion with 7 billion in equity assets and $6 billion in fixed income assets. This was largely offset by foreign currency translation which drove net market depreciation of $12 billion. As we have discussed before, the key to long-term success is delivering strong and consistent performance for our Investment Management clients. Across the global platform, 81% of our client mutual funds' assets ranked in the top two quartiles on a three-year basis and 76% ranked in the top two quartiles on a five-year basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as benefits, was accrued at a compensation-to-net revenues ratio of 40%. This is 300 basis points lower than the Firm's accrual in the first half of the year. The lower compensation accrual reflects stronger year-to-date revenues, greater clarity on full year compensation levels and our continued efforts to improve operating efficiency across the firm. Third quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.3 billion, down 4% sequentially.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Now let me quickly run you through some key stats. Total staff at the end of the third quarter was approximately 33,500. This is up 3% from the second quarter due to summer hiring. Our effective tax rate was 31% year-to-date. Our global core excess liquidity ended the quarter at $180 million. Our Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio was 11.8% using the advanced approach. It was 11.1% under the standardized approach. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished the quarter at 4.9% based on the final rules. We repurchased 7.1 million shares of common stock for $1.25 billion during the quarter. And finally, we announced an increase in our quarterly common stock dividend from $0.55 to $0.60 per share.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Before we turn to Q&amp;A, let me leave you with some concluding thoughts. A constant in our history as a public company is an unrelenting desire to provide world class service to our clients and superior returns to our shareholders. Given the dynamic nature of our industry, meeting that objective requires adaptability. Since we went public in 1999, there are several examples that are readily available. We went from 250 billion assets in 1999 to 1.2 trillion in 2008 and then back to approximately $870 billion today. And along the way we made Goldman Sachs a stronger firm. We increased our common equity from $10 million to over $70 billion and substantially increased our liquidity pool which now fits at $180 billion. We have expanded our global footprint and increased the diversity of our franchise. Our number of offices is up by more than a third to over 50 with one quarter of our staff located in Bangalore, Salt Lake City, Singapore and Texas.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Back in 1999, we had approximately 3,000 people in our technology division. Now we have nearly 8,000. They represent close to a quarter of the firm. We also built an Asset Management business, largely organically, from a few hundred million assets under supervision to 1.15 trillion today. By adapting, we\u2019ve fundamentally improved the strength of our Firm, our opportunity set and as a result our ability to deliver for our clients and our shareholders. Going forward, we will make any necessary changes to continue our history of providing superior client service and generating industry leading returns. It\u2019s what our clients, our shareholders and our culture demands.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Now just before I take your questions, I\u2019d like to make one additional closing comment about the market environment we\u2019ve seen over the past week and particularly yesterday and this morning. It\u2019s clearly an environment that reminds all of us about the power of investor sentiment and how fragile it can be at times. Yesterday in particular, it was clearly a market in the morning where investors were, quite frankly, shooting first and asking questions later. We've seen this market reaction in the past. And while painful, it\u2019s somewhat a normal part of how markets function. Clearly investors are now debating whether we\u2019ll see lower rates for longer and more importantly whether the global economy is slowing or continuing to grow. These are questions that the market has certainly debated before. We\u2019ve always believed that over the long term markets follow fundamentals.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In speaking with our economists only yesterday, they would argue that nothing has fundamentally changed in the past few weeks or certainly the last 24 hours regarding the long-term outlook for the global economy. That doesn\u2019t mean it will continue to grow, but it certainly doesn\u2019t mean it will stall. For us, in any environment, it\u2019s always about staying close to our clients. Yesterday was a difficult day for many of them. Our focus is being there for them. We have the intellectual capital and the financial capital to help address their needs and we remain committed to doing it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">With that, I\u2019m happy to take any of your questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p4\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Operator </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">(Operator Instructions) Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with ISI. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI Group Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Hi, thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Good morning, Glenn.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI Group Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Good morning. So Investment &amp; Lending continues to do great and the future being what it is with this quarter. But I\u2019m just curious, you mentioned the good IPO market obviously, but if you could break down maybe on the equity side what was realized gains versus marks and then if we\u2019ve seen any changes in the composition of the overall asset base between equity debt and lending assets?</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">There hasn\u2019t been a major shift from the -- if you look at the Investing &amp; Lending balance sheet, you won't see a major shift in terms of the quarter. As you know, the investing and the lending business, it\u2019s a long term business and so you will see changes overtime. Obviously, as I highlighted, we continue to harvest. Part of that is obviously driven by the strength in the market but also part of that is driven by the idiosyncratic strength of the portfolio. And so it continues to perform quite well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI Group Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">But no breakdown on realized or unrealized on the equity side?</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">So it's not a question of realized or unrealized. I mean that's why I am struggling with that point. In terms of when you are talking about things of, for example public versus event driven events, but we've always mark to marketed the portfolio as we work through. And so a good portion of the events over the past quarter were all events and IPOs as I highlighted.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI Group Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Okay, good. That's all I was really calling calling towards.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Sorry, I got confused by your wording.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI Group Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">No worries. I confuse myself too. I appreciate the comment on some of the balance sheet data that everyone is looking for. Maybe just one more thing on total losses absorbing capital, you are at the highs, you have tons and you turned out a lot of your long-term debt. You also have among the highs short-term wholesale funding at last look which the Fed has focused on. And so last quarter you did a bunch of repositioning ahead of CCAR and reducing balance sheet and the repo book. I am assuming that no call-out means no big changes this quarter. But if you could just comment on repo book size, short-term wholesale funding and if any more adjustments are needed?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So at this stage we don't feel there is any adjustment needed. As we highlighted and we focused on in the last quarter, the balance sheet did come down pretty significantly. I will say with respect to the balance sheet, as you know, it\u2019s always going to be dynamic. And we'll always take our cues from the clients in the marketplace. But as you saw in the quarter, it basically went up $9 billion. And when you compare the quarter end to quarter end second quarter to third quarter liquidity pool, basically all of that's in the liquidity pool. So that was any growth in the balance sheet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">In terms of the balance sheet, we are going to continuing to remain very disciplined in terms of returns. And as you said, there was no response in terms of the CCAR process last year which drove us to reassess our ROE hurdles that we required and we did that in conjunction with our clients. But we will continue to focus on it. But as you said, the Firm's capital levels and liquidity levels remain quite high. I mean at this stage, 20% of the balance sheet is our liquidity pool.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI Group Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">All right. Last one is -- I appreciate the comments on the market. In the past, when there were big spikes in volatility, if that happened in a short period of time, that was typically bad for the broker dealer community. But inventories are down like, I don't know, 80%, 90%. I am just curious if big spikes and volatility are less painful this go around given all the changes in broker dealer balance sheets?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So I think the comment with respect to the short-term reaction function as it relates to market volatility. As I mentioned, yesterday, today, particularly difficult days for our clients. And if it's difficult for our clients in the short run, markets can be challenging. And so we always root for good things for our clients and for good markets. We will have to see how this period of volatility translates. If you take a step back and you look at the third quarter, when we came into the third quarter, everybody was focused on the fact that there was absolutely no volatility. And as we here see here today people feel like there is too much. So it's a little bit of too hot, too cold. In September, I think a takeaway from September is that in the right market environments you can really see a huge pickup in client activity and then you can see the operating leverage for us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">In terms of the de-risking in terms of the balance sheet that you are seeing across the industry, I don't think that's a 'broker dealer' issue. I think if you look across large global financial institutions and you look at the reduction in risk-weighted assets over the course of the past several years, I think that's a question that we will see overtime as to whether or not that decline in risk carrying capacity along with other adjustments and other regulatory rules, what impact that has ultimately on liquidity for the marketplace. So we will see.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI Group Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">I hear you. Okay, thanks very much. I appreciate it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Thanks, Glenn.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Operator </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Hey thanks, Harvey. Harvey, just one thing on the numbers, just in terms of the -- I think you gave the advanced and the standardized and it looks like that might have been the transitional for the general comment. Just wondered if you had the fully phased in?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Yeah. So the fully phased advanced is 10.6%, fully phased standardized is 10%. And I will remind you again that I think maybe it's a midpoint between fully phased and advanced if you were to think about -- sorry, fully phased advanced. And if you think about how our capital ratios migrate as we take investments out of funds, more or less think of it as a midpoint in terms of the long-term projection. That of course if you assume that between now and 2018, the balance sheet was totally static. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay, that's helpful.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Which of course it won't be.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Yeah. And then just on composition in the comp ratio, I think the color that you gave is helpful and obviously it's a moving target. When I think about this year, last year, the true-up that you do in the third quarter and then you\u2019re trying to gauge what can happen in the fourth quarter, is there anything that's changing or is this just same process, you\u2019ll see other revenue environment factors in and then you'll readjust the fourth quarter? I just want to make sure the process isn't changing versus what you\u2019ve done in the past.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Well, absolutely no change in the process. I won\u2019t drag you through the underpinning to the process. We've talked about it a lot. But at its core, it\u2019s just paper performance. That\u2019s the philosophy and that\u2019s how we do it. In every quarter we make our best estimate as to the compensation accrual. And I think the extent to which you\u2019re seeing a change, there is no change in process. But you\u2019ve seen a change over the last two years just in our operating leverage and the cost reduction efforts that are coming in. And so this year's accrual reflects the fact that last year\u2019s third quarter looked 25% better year-over-year third quarter-third quarter and we\u2019re running $1.4 billion ahead in revenues. And so that just gives us greater clarity in terms of the compensation levels. But it reflects I think more predominantly the operating leverage that's in the business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay. And then finally just on -- I guess you went through some of the ratios on all the regulatory changes that we know and then you\u2019re coming up, whether it\u2019s an SVaR, a few factors, things that are ahead, but it also sounds like the industry is doing some things to maybe get in front of that and whether it\u2019s the agreement on derivatives, there was some chat around the repo markets going to CCPs. So I guess on any of these initiatives that are in the works, is there anything that you would point to that might take care of or deal with some of the concerns that the future regulatory items you\u2019re focused on? I know it\u2019s early, so I know typically you don\u2019t want to comment too much until the rules are out there, but just wanted to get your take, because it does seem a little bit different on the industry just trying to get and find out some of these things.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">I think it\u2019s a really, really important question. I think that when you look at any one of the rules that in an industry we work with regulators on and regulators have put in place new capital requirements, new liquidity requirements under the LCR, leverage tests, in any one of these rules you could have a very active and heated debate with respect to the molecules in the rule and whether this was calibrated too intentionally. But I don\u2019t think you can debate really the concept of the rule. And so I think in concept most of the rules that we\u2019ve seen make sense and that goes back to the initiatives around clearing swap execution facilities. And I think you have to give the regulators a lot of credit quite frankly for creating an immense amount of regulation and proper regulatory response in giving folks a long time line to adjust to it, very important for our clients and for the capital markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">I think the big open question is, and it's a very, very hard thing for any market participant and regulator to weigh if kind of what\u2019s the collective weight of all of this. And I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ll really be able to assess that until a lot of time passes. I think when it comes to things like the discussions around having repo clearing, I think those are good, healthy market reactions. Generally speaking those are a combination of discussions with clients, because they raise concern, regulators observe, for example increased sales in treasury markets and I think it\u2019s incumbent upon all of us as market participants to be thoughtful and creative about how we make sure that we protect our capital markets. But I do think it\u2019s pretty early days in being able to assess these things. But I think the industry is being very active in trying to make sure that we have the most robust capital markets in the world.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. Thanks a lot.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Sure.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Your next question is from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Good morning, Christian.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Good morning. Just wanted to follow up on the question on Investment &amp; Lending. Debt revenues in particular were robust this quarter and stands out given the backdrop of credit were choppy in the quarter. You mentioned assets sales. I would appreciate any color on how much asset sales drove this quarter\u2019s revenues and more broadly any color on the long-term drivers of the debt line?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So in terms of the long-term that was the debt line, again this is just going to be our approach to how we think about allocating capital and when we see opportunities. So, during the period it\u2019s not so much that a specific asset responding to a particular change in credit spreads in the marketplace, but it will be driven by harvesting over a long period of time. So as companies refinance their capital structures, we may be a beneficiary in that, for example if we\u2019re providing mezzanine level debt to a particular entity. And so that\u2019s why we said that it was driven by many things on investment. And of course there is net interest income in there also which is roughly about $200 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Just on the investment banking backlogs, you mentioned that remained strong and increased again this quarter. Just curious, do you have any sense of how much of your backlogs that are tied to so called tax inversion deals?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So with respect to the backlog, the backlog again was the highest it's been since 2007. And actually when we look at it, we look at it across the three categories of advisory, equity underwriting and debt underwriting obviously and all categories were up. So that was good to see. It\u2019s not a question of I think inversions in the backlog. When you actually -- when you talk to our M&amp;A team and you actually look at the data either this year over a long period of time, inversion transactions have not been a significant driver of global M&amp;A activity. And really when you get into conversations with the team, what they'll tell you is it's never just about an inversion or a tax benefit, it\u2019s really about the strategic benefits if the two organizations can come together.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Just a quick clean up question here. In the earnings release you have referenced high impairment charges in non-comp expenses. Just would be helpful if you could kind of size that on what the nature of those charges relate to? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of kind of --.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">I didn't hear -- I heard that you referenced non-comp. I didn\u2019t hear the first part of what do you said there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">You said higher impairment charges within the non-comp line per your earnings release?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">It\u2019s not a material number. We just called it out. But as you know, every quarter we mark-to-market the balance sheet and so assets sitting on the balance sheet. But this quarter it wasn\u2019t material, so roughly about $50 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">50 million? Okay, thank you. And then just lastly for me. You spoke about strengthening your relative position across all your businesses. I guess the equities business is probably the one place where there has been some market share slip based on reported numbers anyway and I appreciate those numbers. I know it\u2019s really apples-to-apples. But was just curious to -- maybe help us frame Goldman\u2019s competitive position in that business and kind of a longer-term outlook.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So, with respect to longer term outlook and our sense of position in the marketplace, we couldn\u2019t be more pleased with it. We measure the business by our engagement with clients and our ability to deliver and that\u2019s in the prime brokerage business, in our global footprint, our ability to provide electronic solutions in terms of trading, commit capital and obviously our connectivity with our banking team in terms of driving capital markets transaction. And so from a franchise perspective, we couldn\u2019t feel better about it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Quarter-to-quarter in terms of top line revenue, I know that\u2019s the data that you have available in terms of market share, not really the way we look at market share. We\u2019re much more focused, as I said, on delivering to clients and driving returns to the bottom line at the same time. And so, I think in terms of the long run, we feel quite good. But quarter-to-quarter you may see revenue move back and forth between us and our competitors, but it\u2019s not a big issue for us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thanks, Christian.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Good morning, Matt.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">You had a pretty big increase in the SLR, I think about 50 basis points versus last quarter and just trying to reconcile what drove that. I think some of it was the assets you actually brought down last quarter that helped the ratio, obviously had positive net income. But was there also a nice benefit from the final SLR rules?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So there were a whole host of things that drove it. We definitely got benefit from the final rules, about 10 basis points. But then when you go through, there was the balance sheet reduction which was [indiscernible]. So as you know, we took the balance sheet down in the second quarter, but it\u2019s daily averaging in the SLR and so you really didn't see that benefit translate through until the third quarter. And then there is other reductions that sort of -- there is other reductions in terms of CDS in the portfolio in terms of that and then obviously there was a capital, we reduced our significant financial institutional deduction, all these things are contributors in terms of driving the increase in ratio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I do think that the SLR is a good example of sort of our philosophy on how we approach regulatory reform. But as you know obviously there has been a significant improvement in that, 70 basis points over a fairly short period of time, and as you point out, 40 basis points in the quarter. We have found that by giving our people the tools, waiting till we see the final rule and then just really focused on complying with the rule, we can move the needle. So, this is just all about compliance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And where do you think you are on the optimization of that? Can you talk about obviously as you get compliance for Volcker, there will be a material benefit there. But what about just the other opportunities? You had a list of things with CDS and the other reductions. How much more, if any, is there of that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">It\u2019s funny. We don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t think we're thinking about it \u2013 it's not like a baseball game here in terms of where we are in the innings of how do we comply. I think the takeaway here is that the SLR is not a significant issue. As we talked about a year ago, it\u2019s much more reflective about complying with the rules. But this will be a process that will be ongoing. You mentioned the Volcker compliance. As you come out of the fund, again, we\u2019re talking about something that's forward looking to 2018. And if we can make those adjustments, we'd be well in excess of 5% today. But let\u2019s see how it goes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. And then just separately on getting compliance for Volcker, there's a lot of focus on that and what it might mean to your equity I&amp;L revenues. But I guess as you think about replenishing the investments with Volcker compliant investments, how is that landscape? Because as I talk to investors, there is some concern that new investment opportunities may not be as good as they\u2019ve been in the past. But what do you think about the outlook for deploying capital in the Volcker compliant manners right now?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So, as we talked about before, there is a number of ways that we can use our capital. And as it comes out of the funds, capital is fungible. And so we will have the ability to continue to invest in Volcker compliant funds, use our balance sheet, other Volcker compliant structures. And so we feel like we have enough flexibility in terms of redeploying that capital. And of course I think this is the critical point. If the opportunities aren't there, obviously we can look to redeploy it into other areas of the firm that demand the capital or we can look to return it to the shareholders. So from that perspective.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So for us it's all about the process and the environment. As we discuss the environment as being a good one for harvesting, we have been able to put capital to work in certain parts of the world and our global footprint certainly gives us an advantage in terms of seeing opportunities. But it's always been -- investing and lending has always been a very long-term long cycle initiative and we will be very disciplined about the returns. If the opportunities are there and they make sense, we will deploy the capital. If not, we will be disciplined and we will wait.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. And we will probably get it in the 10-Q, but you have the level of direct investments now and maybe how that compares to a year or two ago just to show how quickly that's been ramping? </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I don't have the year or two ago numbers. Dane can follow up with you offline. But it's been obviously a bit of a high class problem as we've been harvesting, values have been increasing. We can come back to you and get to the numbers. The I&amp;L balance sheet at the end of the second quarter was roughly 71 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay, all right. Thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Hey, thanks. That was my questions. I'm good.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Hey Betsy, thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Good morning, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Good morning, Guy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Securities services had some pretty attractive quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year revenue growth. I was wondering if you can just help us understand the dynamic there, especially in the context of what you had done last quarter in terms of bringing down some of the securities funding transactions, second part, of that stuff.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I think what you are seeing there may be the allocation of the gain that I referenced as it related to the retirement of the trust preferred securities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Oh, got it. It's there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yes. So as you know, we don't have a corporate cost center. So just a philosophy and a discipline, we allocate out all cost to all the businesses. In this particular case, there was a gain related to funding. So the Institutional Client Services business, the fixed income equity, they are the biggest consumers of balance sheet and liquidity, so they also get the benefit of the gains. And so that's actually really -- I think when you look at it, you will see that that's probably it. We detail it out in the earnings release.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So that aside then maybe you can give us a sense for what is the impact on that business of some of the changes that you made with respect to bringing down the balance sheet in the second quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So that's a good question. So in terms of how we looked at it, it was really, as I said, I would describe it as a two-part process. One is pretty simple and is mathematical. One of the easiest things to do in terms of response to leverage task is actually just to rank the balance sheet in the businesses from lower ROA to higher ROA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">The second part of the exercise is a really high touch exercise where it's engagement in the trenches going through and working with clients and really finding out where we are providing value and where it may need our balance sheet and that's the nuance of the part of the exercise that we went through [indiscernible] and then we will continue to go through. But so far the client engagement [indiscernible] is one of our strongest franchise businesses, so it feels quite good.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Thanks for that. The other question that I had and it goes really back to some of the liquidity points that were being asked about earlier. People have been worried about the impact of the street reducing the liquidity it provides to investors for a while. We heard a lot more about it in the last two weeks of the third quarter. At the same time we know that in the third quarter the [indiscernible] had to begin to make daily reports to regulators based I guess on Volcker and some of the liquidity regs at a pretty deep level of granularity and I was wondering if you felt that this has had any impact broadly on the attractiveness of providing liquidity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I would say no. It's certainly not a Goldman Sachs and I would imagine not the case across the market, although I don\u2019t have any visibility into our competitors. You are right when you say that the data requirements in the first submission that went in right around Labor Day, it's a pretty significant amount of data. I actually think that speaks to the opposite reaction function and I will tell you why. You can't create that data overnight. We had to invest quite a bit of talent mind share, technology, operations front office time and federation time in building the systems. And so that's been a process that's been underway I would assume for all of our competitors and certainly for us since the rule came out. So it wouldn't be as though you'd show up reporting and somehow you would change your profile. I don\u2019t know, that seems like a stretch to me.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I think again it's much more -- it's the collection of the rule sets. We did see increased sales in treasuries, we've seen stress -- and I'm talking about a normal market functioning times, not in stress market functioning times -- definitely where balance sheet has felt scarce. And I think under periods where clients want more liquidity, it may be more difficult to find. But we\u2019ll see how this all shapes out. Again, the impact of the collective rule sets of all the rules, balance sheet, whatever, risk-weighted assets liquidity, it\u2019s pretty enormous and I don\u2019t think we can only have positive effects from that over the next three, four, five, 10 years. I wish that was the case.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And when you add all of that up and going back also to the pricing of securities services and other securities financing transactions, are you in real time seeing that the scarcity value of balance sheet is driving re-pricing that will be favorable to you presumably?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Well, I don\u2019t know. We\u2019ve never been firm that's first and foremost competed on price. We like to compete on content and we like to compete on the ability to provide liquidity, which may mean being the best price at any point in time for our clients. But our clients understand, they\u2019re very knowledgeable and are increasingly knowledgeable about the regulatory constraints that are on us and really the entire industry where we all have the same rule set. And so as the market responds, I just think everyone needs to be more disciplined and some of that will depend on where your return hurdles are. If our return hurdles are higher than someone else's, then we may be more disciplined than the next market participant I have to say.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thanks, Harvey. That\u2019s really helpful color. I appreciate it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Just maybe a couple of questions on the regulatory side that I missed it. Did you disclose your LCR or are you over 100% at this point?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">We didn\u2019t disclose the number. We\u2019re still digesting all the data as you know. But yes, we\u2019re in excess of the minimum requirement.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And we would expect given all the focus we've put on liquidity here.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Right. No, that\u2019s fair. And then just maybe a follow-up question on just sort of the Tarullo commentary and the impact and you just talked about how ROE becomes high ROE hurdles. If you think about his focus about wholesale funding potentially a charge on top of the current SIFI charge, he seems to be specifically focused on repo and even the match book. How do you -- do you think is it just too early to start worrying about it because you mentioned you\u2019re not -- you think your balance sheet is fine or do you think is it something that\u2019s going to be an increasingly something you have to focus on and may continue to shrink that market or change the way you do it, just some color there. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So I think it\u2019s definitely -- and we haven\u2019t even seen a proposed rule and as you know our philosophy around these things is we\u2019ve seen and we will continue to assume that regulators will give the marketplace basically a good glide path to adjust to rule changes. And so we would never react or change the business methodology to commentary. We wait to see the rule. We\u2019d engage in an active dialog on creating a constructive rule.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Clearly we\u2019ll be focused on the impact on markets. It would be very interesting to see where this discussion heads. As you know, and I don\u2019t want to address too much, but as you know the SIFI surcharges are really at their core designed around macro prudential regulation, not micro prudential regulation. And so when you look at our proportion of wholesale funding as a percentage of the marketplace, you can argue we're a lot smaller than many of our large universal bank peers. So we'll really see how the rule plays up. But we\u2019ll engage in an active dialog with the regulators just to ensure that we get the most thoughtful rule in investing for the marketplace and our clients.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay, fair enough. And maybe just one other quickly on the asset management business. You\u2019ve done a good job in turning around and generating positive flows in fixed income and equities. Is the lack of positive flows in alternatives simply your realizations? And if so, if that\u2019s the case, when do you see -- I assume that\u2019s a higher margin area -- when do you see that kind of inflection point where you start to see net flows turn positive?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Sorry. Could you say that again?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Well I\u2019m just trying to think of your alternative AUM.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your net flows have been zero, but I assume that's because you have outflows from -- </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes, we can break it down for you after the call and Dane can give it to you. But basically what you\u2019re seeing there is the harvesting that you\u2019ve seen in the private equity, but you\u2019ve actually seen growth away from that in the other alternative asset categories. But we can break it down for you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay, that\u2019s great. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">The growth has been pretty good.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Hey, good morning, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Hi, how are you?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Good. Quick question following up on one of Jim\u2019s questions there. So your LCR in excess of the minimum, is that the fully phased in minimum or the first minimum threshold of 80%?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">No, sorry, that\u2019s fully phased in.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. Thanks. And then just a question here on the market and sort of your comments to open up the call. Clearly this has been sort of a tough year for hedge funds and October hasn\u2019t been good either. Just thinking about your business and the leverage to financial players, do you think that we could end the year with a real serious withdrawal risk from some of these, some of big portion of your client base? And did that at all impact your decision to adjust the comp ratio here in the third quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">No, that's not how we do that. I think the composition was really driven by the improvement in top line revenues and the operating leverage we gained by managing our expenses. I think volatility comes in different flavors. A couple of months ago people were saying volatility will never return to the marketplace. And as I said now people feel like we have too much volatility. And so I think there is healthy periods of volatility and less healthy periods and really what we\u2019ve seen in the last 48 hours is concentrated position, liquidation obviously triggered by stop loss selling in multiple markets. And at times as we\u2019ve always seen, selling can beget selling.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Our hedge funds, asset managers and institutional clients are an important part of our focus at Goldman Sachs. But we\u2019ll just stay close to our clients during this period. We don\u2019t think about it in terms of days or weeks, in terms of the performance of our clients. It\u2019s really just a commitment to the long run.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">That\u2019s fair. Thanks for that. And then I guess last one for me and it seems like we chat about this every quarter so I wouldn\u2019t want to disappoint you. But I kind of hear you in the equities business that you don\u2019t want to get worked up over quarterly volatility. But it seems as though the equities business on a revenue basis has been losing share for a period in excess of a year. And while it\u2019s certainly encouraging that engagement with clients remains solid, when do you think that that translates into revenue? And I guess when do you become concerned that the engagement is there ultimately to lead the revenue? So, when do you become concerned about that not translating, I guess?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So, look, it\u2019s an important question. And as I said before, we run the business for a focus on our clients and then ultimately margins and returns. In any given quarter quarter-to-quarter you can see noise. In this quarter \u2013 again I don't have visibility into our competitors -- in this quarter we certainly, as I mentioned in the [earnings release] (ph) we had a more challenging part of a cash business and equities client institution, so a bit more challenging for us in blocks. Again, I don\u2019t have visibility. But I think if you step back and you look at Goldman Sachs, I think actually you\u2019re seeing it translate into returns. So, when you eliminate for the quarter an 11.2% ROE for the year-to-date, I think we\u2019re doing whatever we can actually to drive to the bottom line. So I think, I actually think you are seeing it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. Thanks, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Steven Chubak - Nomura</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Hey, Harvey. Good morning. </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Hey. Good morning, Steven.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Steven Chubak - Nomura</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So my first question pertains to the topic of operational risk. And digging into some of the Pillar 3 disclosures for you and your peers and if you\u2019re thinking of actually running at a much lower level as a percentage of RWA at roughly 15% I believe, at least as of Q2, which compares to the remaining universals or at least U.S. domiciled universals running closer to 25 to 30, I don\u2019t know if you can clarify because that calculation is really determined based on the industry rather than company specific event risk, what\u2019s driving that delta?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So, you\u2019re right to say we have less. But I think it really correlates more to the fact that we\u2019re just a less complex financial institution than many of our peers. We don\u2019t have the payment systems, we don\u2019t have the consumer banking side of the business, we don\u2019t have that like a lot of our universal peers have. And also as you know this was also driven by loss experience. And when you look at our loss experience over the last several years, it\u2019s been significantly lower than many of our peers. I think that it\u2019s a pretty straightforward answer.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Steven Chubak - Nomura</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay, fair enough. And then just switching gears over to I&amp;L. We\u2019ve been having more conversations with investors which suggest continued reluctance to ascribe as much value to the contributions simply given a lack of earnings visibility tied to the portfolio again, which at least from my point of view I'd argue it dilutes the contribution from some sustainable fee streams you have there because of lending tied to the private banks. I didn't know given the lack of credit that some have been willing to ascribe to merchant banking and the portfolio gains whether you'd consider updating or amendments to your segment disclosure, at least within I&amp;L, to at the very least disaggregated the merchant banking portion from higher multiple and sustainable revenue streams tied to lending activities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So, maybe I think let's step back for a second. So in terms of how we think about the Investing &amp; Lending businesses, if you look back over the history of time -- and again we approach this over the long term -- it\u2019s been a significant builder of book value and certainly a valuable contribution the way that we've partnered with clients over many many years and we do think we have some competitive advantages in that business in terms of our global footprint and ability to source transactions. And so I think its economic value in terms of its contribution as the margin you can see and it speaks for itself.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I think it\u2019s pro-cyclical. So there is always a discussion about its value in different times of a cycle. But we run it as a pro-cyclical business. And so, I think the question of financial statement presentation I\u2019m happy to take offline with you and Dane. As you know we went through a very thorough review as part of our business standards committee process to actually design our financial statements in a way that actually provide an increased clarity around the various business lines. But we\u2019re always looking to improve that clarity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And so \u2013 look, I think we\u2019re better for having this financial disclosure. At the time we got very positive feedback for it. I don\u2019t want to close and be [quippy] (ph) with you, but yeah, do I think generally speaking the marketplace is undervalued than Goldman Sachs' business, yes. But I don't if it's necessarily the result of the financial statements, but we are happy to look at it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">All right, fair enough. No, I appreciate the color, Harvey, and thank you for taking my questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question is from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Good morning, Matt. Good morning, Harvey. Thanks for taking my question. You mentioned you certainly had some nice improvement in the SLR ratio quarter-over-quarter. Have you said or disclosed what buffer you might have ultimately above the 5% target that everybody is focused on? We have several conversations with investors trying to guess that or estimate that for various companies.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yeah. No, we haven't focused on a buffer yet. Remember that the balance sheet is very dynamic. And so as we comply with the rule and you can see we are making significant progress, but we haven't determined any buffer and obviously we have a couple of years. Again, I will underscore that as we take our investments out of funds, if you were actually to translate those same assets onto the balance sheet, that gets us to a 5.2, 5.3 level anyway. So there is almost a natural tailwind that creates that. But we will constantly reassess and define all these buffers as we get all the final rules.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay, that's helpful. And you mentioned the backlog being so strong and as a combination of a number of different businesses and I am going to ask -- when you talk to the folks particularly in the fixed income side of banking, if the rates actually do go up at some point, how are they thinking about potential future global debt issuance in a period of rising rates given that there has been so much issuance over the past few years at declining rate? I realize it's hard to figure out given the nature of the business tends to focus in many ways and sort of drive by issuance, but how are they thinking about the potential for that type of volume over the next couple of years? </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Look, my crystal ball on these kind of things has never been particularly good. So remember it was a year plus ago we were getting asked questions when we first hit a new record in debt underwriting a year plus ago about the end of the debt underwriting cycle. And so, and again in the second quarter we had another record this year. So very difficult to predict. I think a lot of it depends on the environment associated around the rate increases. I think if it's again a return to normalized rates around the globe where we don't have so much incredible essential bank intervention and that's associated with global growth, I think you could see growth in many economies around the world, I think you will see an increase in capital markets activity because you will see companies want to issue debt as they grow, as they move away from being financed by local banks. So I think it will be environment centric. If you saw -- part of what we've seen is you see large M&amp;A transactions and the M&amp;A environment is quite active, you see a lot of related debt issuance. So I definitely think there is something of a reaction function over short periods of times to rate levels, I think a lot of it will be correlated with global growth.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Thanks very much. And then just a follow-up for me. The 9 billion of the remainder of investments, Volcker related investments you need to move out of overtime, it sounds like that number really hasn't changed much since the second quarter. Is that what we should understand from your earlier comments?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yes, that's right. It's actually right around 8 billion now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay, thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Devin Ryan - JMP Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Most of my questions have been asked. But maybe just a question on acquisitions and now that we are getting a little bit better picture on the capital and regulatory framework. When you think about where you'd like to expand the business over the next several years, does the door open more to thinking about doing acquisitions or really is there anything that could become more interesting kind of growing inorganically as you guys think about the go forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Look, I think we are the leading merger and acquisition advisory firm in the world. It would be some inconsistent philosophically for us. I just think it would be inconsistent with our core being if we say we weren't willing to consider acquisitions. And so I think you should assume philosophically and culturally that as a management team we'd consider any acquisition if it was accretive in any area of our firm. I do think that as you point out, I do think that the ongoing nature of the regulatory environment probably just makes them more difficult for the industry generally. But we will see overtime. But we are always open minded. And having said all that, I think we've benefited as a firm over many years by keeping our culture intact and doing nothing major. But you've seen us do bolt-on acquisitions from time-to-time. So that's how I'd describe it philosophically.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Devin Ryan - JMP Securities</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay, helpful. And then just I guess staying on the M&amp;A theme, just as you mentioned being the leader. When you look at the backlog, are you seeing further divergence around trends within the U.S. and Europe and particularly given I guess maybe the divergence is in the economies right now? Or does this feel like the European M&amp;A backlog and what you are guys are seeing over there in terms of the outlook is pulling off the bottom? I know the U.S. has kind of led the charge there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So in terms of \u2013 there's nothing really material to share with you in terms of the shape of the geographic backlog. As you know, merger transaction is the most significant decision a CEO, his or her management team and a board makes in a life cycle of a company. And so these decisions tend to come into place over many, many years in terms of how they\u2019re executed. At the margin, obviously markets can drive thinking. Sentiment has been a big factor a couple of years ago in preventing transactions from happening. And then when sentiments shifted, you've obviously seen a huge uptick in activity. But there is nothing I would comment on with respect to global activity. Certainly growth, if we see big disparity in growth around the globe, that may be an influencer, but there's nothing to share with you today.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Devin Ryan - JMP Securities</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. All right, thank you. </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Hi, good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Marty, your line is open. Please check to see if it's on mute.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Well, there we go. Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I want to make sure that as we looked at the comp ratio, when we typically get these adjustments as we get towards the end of the year which you\u2019re saying reflect operational improvements and efficiencies, is there any thought about permanently kind of incorporating this throughout the year so that it seems more sustainable and less kind of temporary and year-end adjustment?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Again, there is no change in philosophy on how we\u2019ll this. It\u2019s always going to be a quarter-to-quarter assessment. It\u2019s our best estimate for where we stand at that particular point in the year. And as I said, it reflects all the factors you\u2019ve heard us talk about.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And then you mentioned on the debt underwriting, the regulatory pressure on leverage lending and maybe some impact there. Does that feel a little bit more permanent as you move forward given the stance that we\u2019ve seen talked about openly by the regulators?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So the comment I made about leverage actually didn\u2019t have anything to do with that. That was actually just transaction specific quarter-to-quarter. As I mentioned, the backlog was up at the end of the third quarter across all categories.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Specifically what you\u2019re talking about though, it would be interesting to see how that will evolve. I know market participants, regulators, certainly all those at Goldman Sachs are very focused on the compliance with that and that will be very interesting to see over the next couple of years what impact that has in terms of markets where those transactions get financed, at what leverage levels, and that will be evolving story, we\u2019ll keep eye on.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And then lastly, the $0.05 dividend increase, while still in that kind of 10% range. Your earnings have grown much higher than that over the last year, revenues were up much more than that, excess capital was abundant, your payout ratio is low and your dividend yield is still relatively low. So seems like you had come headroom to maybe potentially go up a little bit more than that. I just didn't know what what your thought was there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So when we assess capital return, as you know our preferred mechanism for capital return is really from share repurchase. We think it allows us to be very dynamic in terms of responding to our clients' needs and market conditions. And so while the dividend has certainly come up meaningfully, I think you should still assume that Goldman Sachs will rely on share repurchase as its predominant tool.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Got you. And humor me for one more question. If we look at the market commentary you said with the pain and the volatility coupled with the kind of regulatory Volcker kind of compliance move and your VaR coming down, do you feel like as a market maker you're kind of hamstrung in ability to kind of help the market go through some of these transitions now given all the new regulations?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I just want to be clear with that. You may have misheard me or I may have misheard you. There was nothing that I saw about Volcker compliance that I think is at this stage preventing people from providing liquidity. Volcker has been pretty visible for a while now. </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">The comment I was making is that it\u2019s very hard to assess the collective impact of leverage rules, increases in risk-weighted assets reductions in balance sheet globally in terms of the entire industry and what that means for market liquidity. And we\u2019ve certainly seen areas where people \u2013 I haven't looked at all the data, but most firms at this stage have actually shrunk their match books. I think I\u2019m pretty accurate in saying that. And so all market participants, regulators included, have been asking themselves the question of when we were seeing increases in sales and treasuries whether how much of that was driven by market makers' inability or lack of appetite or not being able to position balance sheet in terms of providing that liquidity at important times.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">We'll have to see again how all this evolves. When you look at Goldman Sachs today given the level of our capital ratios, which I described earlier in the call, we certainly have the capacity to deliver for our clients when they need it. </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Your next question comes from the line Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Brian Kleinhanzl - KBW</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Hi, Brian.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Brian Kleinhanzl - KBW</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Just quick question, when you look at some of the regulations coming down the road here and also funding surcharge being one of them and the NSFR, both of those would benefit from a greater level of deposit funding on the balance sheet in effect. Are you thinking about growing deposits currently? And if you are, kind of are you thinking about organically or through acquisition or are you just not going to think about it at all?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So we obviously focus on -- I think in the context at the moment, this will be very interesting because, you mentioned NSFR so let's just use that as an example. I think as an example of a rule and a concept, I think again that falls into the bucket of a good concept because you want good asset liability management across the industry. We spend a huge amount of time on asset liability management the way that we look at secure funding and how we manage our balance sheet and we run a very conservative profile in terms of how we manage that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">With respect in this rule, it will be very interesting because we haven\u2019t even seen the Basel rule yet. I think the big question will be again, when you add this rule on to other rules if there are some long term impact on market liquidity so obviously clients and we will be very focused on that. As this goes to the rule-making process because you specifically make just a deposit, it will be very interesting when you get to the U.S. because as you know in the U.S. it\u2019s a different legal structure in terms of your ability to use deposit funding for certain businesses. And so not only do we need to wait to see the Basel rule, but then we\u2019ll need to see the U.S. rule and how they incorporate just a different legal structure that exists in the U.S. So we\u2019ll have to see how it goes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Brian Kleinhanzl - KBW</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay. And just a separate question on the ECM backlog. Is there any specific reason that\u2019s kind of driving strength there? I think you said last quarter Europe was strong in underwriting but this quarter has that changed?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">No, it's just a normal part of the marketplace in terms of people coming to the markets and raising capital for a variety of needs. But there is no key driver.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Brian Kleinhanzl - KBW</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay, great. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And at this time there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">So again, since there are no more questions, I would like to take a moment to thank all of you for joining the call. Hopefully I and other members of the senior management will get to see you many of you in the coming months. Certainly if there is any additional questions, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to Dane. And otherwise, enjoy the rest of your day. Look forward to speaking with you on the fourth quarter call. Take care.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong> </p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call.

My name is Dennis and I\u2019ll be your conference facilitator today. I\u2019d like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today, January 16, 2015. Thank you. Mr. Holmes, you may begin your conference.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Dane Holmes</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. Today\u2019s call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the Firm\u2019s belief regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain and outside of the Firm\u2019s control. The Firm\u2019s actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the Firm\u2019s future results, please see the description of risk factors in our current annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 2013. I\u2019d also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets and Global Core Excess. And you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that is posted on the Investor Relations portion of our Web site at www.gs.com.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">This audiocast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Our Chief Financial Officer, Harvey Schwartz, will now review the Firm\u2019s results. Harvey?</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thanks, Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I'll walk you through the fourth quarter and full-year results. Then I\u2019m obviously happy to answer any questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Briefly on the fourth quarter, net revenues were $7.7 billion. Net earnings were $2.2 billion and earnings per diluted share were $4.38. With respect to our annual results, we had firm-wide net revenues of $34.5 billion, net earnings of $8.5 billion, earnings per diluted share of $17.07 and a return on common equity of 11.2%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Revenues were roughly consistent with last year. We grew net earnings by 5%, book value per share by 7%, and earnings per diluted share by 10%. If we take a step back and assess 2014, there have been challenges to the global economy and therefore the operating environment for our clients.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">We have seen a global economy that has been grinding itself towards growth. Different countries are naturally at different stages of the economic cycle and the interconnectedness of these different economies has made the transition to growth somewhat extended, choppy, and oftentimes unpredictable.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Having a global client footprint means that we\u2019re impacted by both global and regional fluctuations. Most importantly, it also means that we're a diversified enterprise. The consistency of our annual revenues is a testament to both the products and geographic diversity of our operations, and the stability they collectively provide.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Weakness in Asia or Europe can be offset by strength in the U.S. Headwinds in institutional client services can be offset by strength in investment banking or investment management. Ultimately, our shareholders own a combination of industry-leading global businesses that have collectively generated superior returns.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We've also achieved our results in the face of significant regulatory change. The financial services industry and our Firm specifically, have been responding to unprecedented levels of new regulation. The regulators and the industry have done a tremendous amount of work here and as a result have made the system stronger, and significantly safer.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Since 2012, we undertook several strategic initiatives to respond to new regulations and at the same time derisk the firm. This included a $55 billion balance sheet reduction over the past year. In addition, we sold our Americas reinsurance business, we sold our European insurance business and we liquidated our investment in ICBC. Along with those actions, we also sold our hedge fund administration business and our ready platform.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In 2012, the businesses and investments that I just listed produced $2.3 billion in revenue. As a result, since then we had to replace in excess of $2 billion of revenues in 2014 just to match 2012 levels.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">As I said, the last three years have required us to adapt and source new revenue opportunities at attractive returns. Between 2012 and 2014, investment banking and investment management generated $2.4 billion of incremental revenues. This achievement demonstrates the strength of our client franchise, the diversity of our operations, the commitment and quality of our people and our culture of adaptability.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Now I\u2019ll discuss each of our businesses starting with Investment Banking. Before digging into the details here, it\u2019s worth noting a few achievements from 2014. We were number one in M&amp;A, advising on more than $1 trillion in announced transactions. We also ranked first in global equity and equity-related and common stock offerings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">As it relates to the quarter, Investment Banking produced net revenues of $1.4 billion, slightly lower than the third quarter. A decline in underwriting activity offset a pick up in completed M&amp;A. For the full-year, Investment Banking net revenues were $6.5 billion, up 8% from 2013 on the back of a significant improvement in advisory revenues and modestly higher equity underwriting revenues. This was slightly offset by lower debt underwriting revenues following record results in 2013.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Breaking down the components of Investment Banking in the fourth quarter, advisory revenues were $692 million; the 16% increase relative of the third quarter reflects the increase in industry-wide completed M&amp;A. We advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the fourth quarter, including Walgreen\u2019s $15.3 billion acquisition of the remaining 55% interest in Alliance Boots, Royal KPN\u2019s 8.4 billion euro of E-plus to Telefonica, Deutschland and Athlon Energy\u2019s $7.1 billion sale to Encana.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We also advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the fourth quarter, including Allergan\u2019s $66 billion sale to Actavis, Baker Hughes $38 billion sale to Halliburton and Talisman Energy\u2019s $13 billion sale to Repsol.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Moving to underwriting, net revenues were $748 million in the fourth quarter, down 14% sequentially with both equity and debt issuance slowed. Equity underwriting revenues of $342 million, were down 20% compared to third quarter results largely due to a decrease in secondary offerings and private placements. Debt underwriting revenues decreased 9% to $406 million due to a significant decline in leverage finance activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">During the fourth quarter, we actively supported our clients' financing needs, participating in Becton Dickinson\u2019s $7.2 billion financing to support their purchase of CareFusion, ICBC\u2019s $5.6 billion debt offering and Fiat Chrysler\u2019s $4 billion common stock and convertible offering. Our Investment Banking backlog improved from third quarter levels and finished at its highest level since 2007.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our FICC and equities businesses. Net revenues were $3.1 billion in the fourth quarter, down 17% compared to the third quarter. For the full-year, $15.2 million of net revenues were down 3% relative to 2013. FICC Client Execution net revenues were $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter and include a $55 million of DVA gains. Excluding DVA, and last quarter\u2019s gain related to our trust preferred tender, revenues were down 41% sequentially as certain businesses were impacted by either lower client activity or more difficult market making conditions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Interest rates were lower sequentially as client activity declined amid a challenging environment. Credit decreased as the market was characterized by widening high-yield spreads and low levels of liquidity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Mortgages declined versus the third quarter, as volatility and client activity were generally low. While currencies was lower than a very robust third quarter, volatility remain high and client activity were still solid. Even higher volatility and energy markets, commodities improved sequentially and were supported by stronger client activity levels. For the full-year, FICC client execution net revenues were $0.5 billion, down 2% year-over-year. Excluding DVA, the gain related to our trust preferred tender, and the impact of the 2013 European Insurance sale, revenues were down 5% relative to 2013.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees and security services, net revenues for the fourth quarter were $1.9 billion, up 21% sequentially and included $27 million in DVA gains. Equities Client Execution revenues increased 75% sequentially to $751 million due to a more favorable backdrop with higher equity prices and increased client activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Commissions and Fees were $829 million, up 11% relative to the third quarter supported by an increase in client volumes. Security Services generated net revenues of $351 million, up 2% sequentially adjusting for last quarter\u2019s gain related to our trust preferred tender.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">For the full-year, equities produced net revenues of $6.7 billion, down 5% year-over-year. Excluding DVA, the gain related to our trust preferred tender and the 2013 sale of our reinsurance business, results were down 4% relative to 2013.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to risk. Average daily VaR in the fourth quarter was $63 million, down from $66 million in the third quarter with the largest decrease coming from interest rates.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Moving on to our Investing &amp; Lending activities. Collectively these businesses produced net revenues of $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of $982 million, primarily reflecting company specific events including initial public offerings and gains in public equity investments. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $358 million, which was relatively balanced between net interest income and net gains on certain investments. Other revenues of $192 million include the Firm\u2019s consolidated investments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In the fourth quarter, we sold our investment in Metro International. For the fourth quarter and full-year, Metro contributed $70 million and $325 million respectively to other revenues. For the full-year, Investing and Lending generated net revenues of $6.8 billion, driven by $3.8 billion in gains from equity securities, $2.2 billion of net revenues from debt securities and loans and $847 million of other revenues.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In Investment Management, we reported fourth quarter net revenues of $1.6 billion, up 7% from the third quarter primarily as a result of $200 million in incentive fees largely from alternative asset products. Management and other fees were up 1% sequentially to a record $1.23 billion. For the full-year, Investment Management net revenues were a record $6 billion, up 11% from 2013 on record management and other fees which benefited from growth in our assets under supervision. During the fourth quarter assets under supervision increased $28 billion to a record $1.18 trillion, due to net inflows into liquidity products.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On a full-year basis, we have long-term fixed income inflows of $58 billion and equity inflows of $15 billion. Alternative inflows were $1 billion and included $6 billion from fund of funds offset by net outflows from other private equity and credit funds.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Moving to our performance, across the globe, 83% of our client mutual fund assets ranked in the top two quartiles on a three-year basis. And 75% ranked in the top two quartiles on a five-year basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as benefits, remain roughly flat at $12.7 billion for 2014 and translated into a compensation-to-net revenues ratio of 36.8%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Fourth quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.5 billion, 11% higher than the third quarter, reflecting $137 million donation to Goldman Sachs Gives, our donor advised charitable fund. For the full-year, non-compensation expenses were down 4%, primarily due to lower provisions for litigation and regulatory expenses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Total staff at year-end was approximately 34,000, up 3% from year-end 2013. Our effective tax rate was 31.4% for 2014. Our global core excess liquidity end of the quarter at $183 billion. Our Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 12.2% using the advanced approach. It was 11.3% under the standardized approach.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Our supplementary leverage ratio finished the quarter at 5%. The Firm is now compliant with the 2018 minimum.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We repurchased 6.6 million shares of common stock for $1.25 billion during the quarter. For the full-year, we repurchased $5.5 billion helping to reduce our average fully delivered share count by 26 million shares year-over-year. In addition, we increased our quarterly dividend to $0.60 per share in the fourth quarter and paid out approximately $1 billion of common dividends during the year. In total, we return $6.5 billion of capital to shareholders while at the same time continuing to grow our regulatory capital ratios.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Now before I take your questions, let me offer some closing thoughts. Looking back on our performance in 2014, the Firm continued to execute on its operating strategy. We remain committed to our clients, providing superior service and execution which is central to building any long-term relationship. The strength of our client franchise is reflected in our returns and our leading market position. For example, we ended the year as the global leader M&amp;A with more than $1 trillion in announced transactions. This is nearly $250 billion greater than our next closest competitor.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We were ranked first in global equity, and equity related and common stock offerings for 2014. We helped deliver nearly $300 billion in equity capital from our investing clients to our corporate clients. We executed more than 2 billion transactions for our institutional investing clients across equities, fixed income, currencies, and commodities. And we\u2019re the trusted investment manager for in excess of $1 trillion in assets. Our track record of performing for our clients has translated into a leading market position within each of our businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Another area of focus has been on our efficiency, well operating efficiency and capital. We announced an expense initiative from a position of strength in 2011. We believe this was an important step, which positioned us to remain externally focused over the past three years. Continued discipline on compensation levels and focus on non-compensation expenses has contributed to 300 basis points of pre-tax margin expansion since 2012.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Our capital philosophy is also clear. Having a strong capital base, not only allows our firm to be front footed in helping our clients capturing opportunities, but also provides protection in more difficult operating environments. The existence of multiple capital regulations has materially increased the need for robust capital planning tools. To try better capital efficiency and comply with new regulatory requirements, we\u2019ve developed critical technology and operating infrastructure to inform our allocation decisions. While they can never replace good judgment, these tools certainly help to inform it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">In closing, Goldman Sachs is essentially made up of our clients, your capital, and our people. Our Firm stands ready to use its financial and intellectual capital to serve our clients through this evolving period in the global economy. We are committed to consistently delivering the Firm and its entirety to our clients and maximizing our impact. And we\u2019re equally committed to generating superior returns for our shareholders through the cycle.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Thank you again for dialing in. And now I'm happy to answer any questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p5\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Hi. Thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Hey, good morning, Glenn.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Good morning. First one on Investing and Lending. You had mentioned that there are a bunch of sales inside the equity piece. Would you mind just updating us on what\u2019s left in the book equity wise that eventually has to be liquidated for Goldman? And in conjunction with that, have you been replacing on balance sheet to backfill?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So we will just take a step back. You remember from the third quarter, the Investing and Lending balance sheet was roughly $76 billion, which broke down roughly 14 -- $4 billion of public equity, $18 billion of private equity and the balance really -- the vast majority of the balance sheet in that north of $50 billion. And so in terms of the -- in the equity line, I think what you\u2019re continuing to see is just really the idiosyncratic performance of the portfolio. We\u2019ve guided you over time that over long periods the portfolio will correlate with the MSEI [ph] or other public indices and -- but there will still be times where we will outperform that or under-perform that. And in this particular quarter, there were -- really the vast majority of the gains in the portfolio were driven by things that we refer to as event driven. So it was either the potential for very near-term IPO we took something public where there was a refinancing event. We don\u2019t look at this of course on a quarterly basis, but you will remember I highlighted to you in the last quarter that when we\u2019ve taken Mobileye public it had contributed $285 million in revenues and that would be an example of something that it was down during the course of the quarter, that was down a bit more than $70 million. In terms of reinvesting and the portfolio, our strategy here is unchanged in terms of our philosophy, in terms of how we think about the capital. Where we can deploy capital to our clients and where we can find attractive returns, then we will pursue them, but we\u2019re going to be very disciplined about the kind of returns that we can gain out of the marketplace. And so you will continue to see us do this one good thing in the quarter that you saw was that the regulators finalized the extension of the Volcker Rule and so there will be two one year extension there. So that was good to see as -- I think it was thoughtful by the regulators, because it will -- would have otherwise we might have seen fire sales across the marketplace.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">And equity left, Goldman\u2019s equity piece left? I think it went from 9 to 8 to 6, if my memory serves me correctly. Where are we at now?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So are you talking about sort of -- there is two things that sometimes I didn\u2019t get [indiscernible]. I think if you\u2019re firmly [indiscernible] where the -- our investment is in terms of the private equity portfolio that was -- we were discussing under Volcker before the extensions, that\u2019s roughly around $8 billion. There was some harvesting, but that was offset by some gains. Again, now that\u2019s an extended two years. If you're talking about the significant financial institution reduction which is a separate number that relates to our Basel III capital ratios, that\u2019s now roughly about $5 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay, perfect. That's what I was looking for.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Sorry, I wasn\u2019t sure exactly. I probably should have gotten there faster.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">No, I probably should have worded it better. So then a big picture question, a couple of quarters ago, we are all bumming out that every volatility chart points down. Now rates, volatility, oil volatility, FX volatility, credit volatility all thumbs up, and all the banks get beaten up on inventories that we thought were a lot less. So could we talk about good vol versus bad vol and what we are supposed to root for?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Yes, it\u2019s I don\u2019t know it\u2019s a little -- I guess it\u2019s -- what is it? Is it a Goldilocks? Its too cold, its too hot? We can\u2019t find the right temperature. I think when you look -- I find it very interesting to sort of juxtapose the third quarter and the fourth quarter, because I think it really highlights what you\u2019re saying. We came into the third quarter and as you said everybody bemoaning knew the fact that there was nothing happening in the world in July and then we got into the summer doldrums of August. And then we came back and foreign exchange was very active. There was a lot of momentum and you saw big uptick in client activity in certain parts of the business. Now we come into the fourth quarter and I don\u2019t know if you want to call it unhealthy volatility, but in October we had our -- whatever you want to refer to in markets, now referred to as the Treasury Flash Crash. And then, Greece, the continuation of Russia, a huge decline in the oil price, which of course it started in June, but nearly came into frame in the fourth quarter which weighed heavily on credit markets. And so, I don't think when you look back in the fourth quarter, any of this should be particularly surprising. When you see that much pressure on credit markets, in terms of the ability as a market maker on the course of the quarter, to manage liquidity, I don\u2019t think its particularly surprising, particularly the stress that came under high-yield as a result of the energy decline. Now for us, there were some real bright spots in the quarter in fixed income, which is why we think about it long-term, we will tell you that the energy price has been declining, our ability to be an active and valuable provider of hedging solutions that a market maker do are energy sensitive and commodity sensitive clients. Was it\u2019s a kind of thing you really see. But it's not always going to be case that in a given quarter, I need to pretty unique events we\u2019re talking about. But again, in the end it\u2019s all going to be driven by the client activity, client uncertain types of volatility will drive more client activity. And certain will make people want a recede and be a little more protective. I know we\u2019re all focused on it, but quarter over quarter when you think of the events; I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a surprising actually.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Then the follow-on on that is just, in credit specifically, which is probably the most liquidity-dependent. Do the desks themselves, or do your risk management practices, do you tend to exit positions during times of stress like that or should we be thinking about you are sitting on the same kind of book right now, just at lower prices?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So we\u2019re always managing the risk components of many of our books, regardless of the environment. And the kind of market that we\u2019re talking about, it\u2019s really very natural on what they\u2019re doing at the desk level. So they\u2019re obviously fulfilling their client responsibilities in terms of making market, but it can be particularly challenging from time to time. But again, this is a long-term commitment. I wouldn\u2019t say that there were any significant support, exposures, in terms of that we are really focused on. But obviously things that have been in frame for a while Russia, Greece, energy whatever the case might be. Obviously we pay a lot of attention to those things. Again, as we\u2019ve said in the past Glenn, it's a moving business not a storage business. And just sometimes moving is harder.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">I appreciate that. My times up, thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Hey, Glenn. Thanks so much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Thanks, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Good morning, Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Hi. Harvey, just upfront you mentioned a lot of the businesses that have been repositioned. I think you mentioned the $2.3 billion on the revenue side. I guess when we look at 2015, near now that most of the rules are finalized; I guess is the vast majority of the repositioning out of the way? I guess because when I look at the ratios, you're basically where you need to be. So should we see ongoing like revenue headwinds, or is the repositioning mostly through?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So look we will have to see as all the rules ultimately get finalized. There is still a number of rules out there, but so I\u2019d say things that we very deliberately did in terms of derisking the firm or responding to regulatory requirements like the sales of the insurance business, the other things I listed, there is nothing right now that we\u2019re looking at you should expect to see in the near-term. Having said that, these businesses have always been dynamic, they will remain dynamic and over the next many years things will continually evolve and we look to be very dynamic in all of those businesses, whether they\u2019re market structure changes, whether they\u2019re things like we\u2019ve seen in terms of regulatory driven. I mean it just -- I think this is what you need to do to manage the business as well. So we will continue to focus on capital and make sure we\u2019re using the capital as efficiently and effectively as possible, all these things are just part of daily life.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay, got it. And then just maybe on the same topic, or somewhat related to it, just in terms of your Tier 1 ratio going up to 12.2, if you can give us the components. It looks like RWA shrunk in the quarter, but just want to know what drove that, and then going forward is there anything else in the pipeline?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So in the third quarter [indiscernible] it went up to 12/2 as I referenced. So on the -- if you really want to break that down into the molecules, give or take roughly 10 basis points came from just growth in capital. Another 10 basis points came from various steps we\u2019re taking in terms of managing the capital better and then the balance -- really it was about risk reduction and it was much driven by the drop off in client activity towards the end of the quarter than anything else. So you could see this bounce back. In terms of staff again, we\u2019re going to continue to adjust all the capital rules, and as I said we\u2019ve invested heavily in getting the tools out and as we discussed at your conference, we now have a uniform framework that we\u2019re deploying across the Firm in terms of that how we think about best utilizing their capital ensuring that we position it most effectively for all of our clients and so, again that\u2019s going to be, I don\u2019t know if you want to call part of the new world, but that\u2019s part of the world that we live in now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Got it. And then, last one, just given the volatility that we\u2019re seeing both in the oil markets, more recently in the FX market. Just want to get, your guys perspective of obviously you mentioned on the commodity side that can present same opportunities in terms of more activity. On the flipside is lot of risk associated with that, depending on what happens, just want to see how you guys are managing that risk. In the quarter, was there anything significant particularly in the FICC, just because it was a little lighter than expected. That weight on any of the segments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So as I said in the quarter, it really was a tough quarter in the credit business, also when mortgages on a relative basis, but more pronounced in the credit business areas. In terms of the commodity businesses, I think it\u2019s almost worth taking a step back. If you think about over the last couple of years, we\u2019ve often been asked a question hey, it seems like everybody else is getting out of the commodity business. How come you\u2019re not getting out of the commodity business? And for sure commodities have been quite for a little while and we\u2019ve got -- you remember we got that question pretty frequently and the answer give us a pretty straightforward which is when we dealt with our clients we knew the business of hedging, managing their risks, investing in clients. We knew that was an important part of what they did and it ties very nicely into our investment banking franchise where we provided advice and capital to all those clients.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And so, I know it\u2019s a bit of a reminder when you see the fourth quarter where you see a pick up in performance that reinforces that you which really need to listen to your clients when you\u2019re thinking about your strategy in terms of the businesses that you invest in and those businesses you protect across the cycle. And so, part of the consistency that you\u2019ve seen from us is the investment in these various businesses across a long cycle. It might be commodities. A couple of years ago, people were talking about the fact that merger were never coming back. And so from a commodity perspective, in terms of risk, our risks are quite manageable to the sector. You would asked that also, so I just want to finish with that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. Sounds good. Thanks a lot.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question comes from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Good morning, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hey, good morning. Thanks for dialing in.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thank you. Just on the Outlook for 2015, in your press release earlier this morning, Lloyd struck an optimistic tone speaking to seeing evidence of a pick up in a global economy that will improve the opportunity set for 2015? Could you be a bit more specific and speak to how you see that improved opportunity set a evolving on a business by business basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So I will give you my perspective on that. When you talk to the economists inside Goldman Sachs, the general view whether you\u2019re talking about the U.S which clearly have a more optimistic view in terms of growth. Europe, Asian, is generally positive and as I said its more of a continue grinding forward. And so, if we see continued stability in terms of market, normalization of interest rates and really fundamentally steady growing GDP. Those are the things that are historically over cycles. Have translated well for us, because it contributes to global confidence and global confidence contributes to activity. And so, it kind of gets back to the theme I started with earlier which is -- in over the last couple of years, we\u2019re ourselves have made adjustment in an environment which has been choppy as I said and also a bit on event and what we needed to do is, we needed replace significant revenues and so you see what we\u2019re doing to the extent which we hopefully will have fewer revenues replaced in the future. Hopefully this will translate into growth. But, again it\u2019s all going to be driven by the environment. That\u2019s the one thing we can\u2019t control. We can just respond it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. On the equities business, I apologize if I missed this in your prepared remarks. But just curious as to what drove the strength in the equity kind of execution line?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So for a couple of quarters, I know you were focused on, it looks a little lower. In this particular quarter, there were some very solid opportunities to provide capital declines and volumes but again when you look across the equity business, when we see uptick in client activity and when you see trending prices, the strength of a franchise really comes to the front whether its in prime brokerage client execution or commissions and fees.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. Sounds like its a little more lumpy than you would normally expect for the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">There is some seasonality in there, there is some rebalances that we participated in some other things, but again these are one time event. They\u2019re just annual event. They haven\u2019t drilled the course of the year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. And then just lastly for me a quick clean up question. Under sale of Metro, you noted $325 million in revenues last year. What kind of costs came with those revenues?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">It\u2019s a very small contributor to pre-tax.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Perfect.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">You shouldn\u2019t think of it as meaningful at all in pretext terms.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Perfect. Thank you, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Operator </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with COSA. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Hi.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Good morning, Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Given the big movement, the Swiss franc there is some reports that banks lost some big money, specifically what happened this week. Can you comment and then more generally, how would this impact to your move towards electronic trading of FX?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So well, first of all, in terms of Goldman Sachs, immaterial from an economic perspective. So you\u2019re only worried about that, there is noting there. I will say what we all witnessed yesterday is pretty extraordinary. I haven't confirmed any stats , but just going to with some of the folks, the single largest move in a day of any developed country, I think it was something like a 20 plus standard deviation move. I think it was like after three plus years of 2% volatility. So you\u2019re right to call it extraordinary, but again no issues here. For us it really is an opportunity, really for very high-level engagement with clients who both need liquidity and then the longer term questions about working with local corporates who had an immediate shift in competitiveness and what does that mean? So there\u2019ll be obviously a long-term focus. In terms of each rating, there\u2019s only things you take away from these or I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll potentially be some lessons learned, but I don\u2019t necessarily have any major takeaways. It certainly doesn\u2019t change our investments largely in terms if you think about each rating.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And then one other question, you mentioned the 300 basis point pre tax margin improvement since 2012. I have to imagine it might get tougher if revenues don\u2019t grow more. What are some additional levers you have for pre tax margin? You\u2019ve got a lot on non-comp and you certainly have done a lot on comp. Is there any more to go?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So, well first of all Mike I appreciate acknowledging our effort on expansion because it has been really a multi-year effort in terms of being disciplined. Again it\u2019s going to be environment driven. Right now when we look at the global footprint, we feel really, really well positioned in terms of our geographic footprint and our product footprint. But we\u2019re committed to staying very focused on expenses. You\u2019re not going to see us take the foot off here, and so, we\u2019ll see. The big thing that we\u2019ve been trying to achieve in the last couple of years as we\u2019ve talked about a lot is putting an operating leverage. And while we\u2019ve replaced the two plus billion dollars in revenues over the last couple of years, it would be great we\u2019d all like to see the environment being one that provided another couple of billion dollars in revenues, and we think we have that operating leverage. So we feel well positioned.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">All right. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thanks Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Hi, Matt.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">If I can first follow up on the expense question, maybe just trying to get a little more detail in terms of the opportunity from here. I think you and a lot of other firms have a relocation strategy trying to bring down some of the especially back office and non-sales facing costs. Maybe if you could just kind of frame it the opportunity there; I think a lot of people also look at the state of raw and think those opportunities to become less top heavy and then obviously there\u2019s the new structural reduction in comp that does contribute it. So, maybe just pushing a little bit on where you can go from here on expenses?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So as part of the expense probably from the last couple of years, and it\u2019s a great question. As you know, we have been diversifying ourselves geographically in places like Salt Lake City, Bangalore and others and it represent about 25% of the firm\u2019s headcount at this stage give or take. I think there is continued opportunity. One thing I\u2019ll say which is, something at this stage which is hard to quantify, but we\u2019re looking to take a leadership role in which is, over the next several years as you really get all these rules in place around all the various training venues around the world. There certainly will be a need for scale consistency across the various market participants and the way things are processed, the way information is managed, the way transactions are confirmed and things are reported, and so the short note of that is, internally we\u2019re going to continue to lever technology anywhere we can and that\u2019s been a big part of what we\u2019ve done. But we\u2019re also going to try and do that as much as we can working with other folks in the industry and our clients to make sure all being is efficient as we possibly can as we all work in the same rule set. Now, you didn\u2019t specifically ask about it, but obviously we\u2019re going to stay relentlessly focused on the balance sheet and how we deploy our capital.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. Actually that kind of brings me to the next question. Earlier it was asked about looking at maybe businesses or areas to get out of a swap, but as we just think about your current business mix and the opportunity to adopt to the new capital rules, how much opportunity is there to refine the balance sheet and have those ratios increase more than you would think just based on say the net income less capital deployment?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Well, I think when you look at our ratios now, but we think they\u2019re in quite a good place. We\u2019ll see what happens with the, when the final rules are done. I guess, I would say, we start again with the client businesses and given the strength of all of our businesses at this stage, equities, fixed income, investment banking, asset management, our investing and lending business. We look at the strength of those business leads and our competitive position, it really feels at this stage it\u2019s very, very tactical and it\u2019s about fine point execution. Now of course that could all change and again we\u2019ll stay nimble, but that\u2019s where we would stand today.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. And I guess, just to push on that like, it was just a year and half ago that the supplemental leverage ratio was even proposed, so I would assume it\u2019s hard to be completely efficient in adopting that throughout the businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes, sorry. I think you\u2019ll continue to see improvement in things like that. That\u2019s not what I was saying. What I was saying is, its going to be tactical and we\u2019ll continue to work at it because you\u2019re right, we\u2019re new and we\u2019re just living with it. But I don\u2019t see it at this stage given the adjustments the business we\u2019ve sold, the things we\u2019ve done, the balance sheet. I don\u2019t see us making bigger decision in terms around our business commitment and our commitment to our clients. That\u2019s what I meant. So you\u2019re not going to see the sales and other reinsurance business soon.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. But just the, adopting these -- on the day sale question is, how much optimizing is there out there further due maintaining your current strategy and the strengths that you have?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We can always do more and you\u2019ll see us do more. But I\u2019m not in a position to quantify for you today.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. All right. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Hi, good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Good morning, Betsy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I just wanted to ask a couple of questions on VaR. I was intrigued by the straightforward which came down queue-on-queue and obviously we had the flash crash in October. So does this represent maybe a VaR that went up early in the quarter? And then as folks move to the sidelines that came back down or am I thinking about that wrong?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So, if you look at the in the VaR quarter-over-quarter it went from 66% down to 63% and you see the rate category move down current changes are but it sort of followed more the flows and levels of activity. In some businesses it was the result of position changes, but I don\u2019t think there is any major takeaways market volatility was a bigger driver and position changes was really a net reduction.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">[Indiscernible] volatility, you had essentially bad volatility in rates, so I suppose that\u2019s why it came down a bit, but should we expect that is, if you get some slightly higher volatility or I would expect it would move higher. Is that accurate or no?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes, so I think maybe the best way to answer this question is to think about it in terms of average volatility across the quarter, and so the way we look at it because as we\u2019ve discussed before from a risk perspective VaR is an important risk measure, but obviously it can be influenced by market volatilities. So, if you actually, if you look at the change in terms of how it moved the market volatility was an increase it was more or less offset by position reductions during the course of the quarter and that\u2019s what drove the change. In rate specifically volatility was up and our positions were down. And that probably gives you a really good roadmap in terms of how the risk moved during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes. Got it. Okay. And then separately just could you give us a sense as to how you\u2019re thinking about the asset management business and opportunities to expand that inorganically if there is any sense of \u2026?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So you\u2019ve seen us do small bolt-on acquisitions over time. We\u2019re constantly looking at things. Obviously asset management has been a very important driver of growth over the last several years and this is, we\u2019re really -- I think in the early stages of where you\u2019re seeing a strategic initiative to grow asset management, the team has done a great job and I highlighted the three and the five year returns. So, we\u2019re open to really looking at anything, and so it\u2019s really all -- we\u2019ll all be driven by whether or not we think we can improve our performance and deliver better results for our clients. So, I would say we\u2019re very open-minded. But again, these things have to be accretive and we look through them at a very careful lens.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And distribution, is that something that you could potentially add to?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">We feel quite good about the -- we really do feel like we have a significantly differentiated private wealth franchise and our institutional team is great and we get a lot of value out of our third party distributors and so, again Betsy, look we\u2019re the leading M&amp;A firm in the world. So I think it was good idea walking the door and one of our bankers had it, we\u2019d be the first firm to talk about it. It will be a little inconsistent with our whole philosophy not to talk about it, but it\u2019s not a priority right now for us. It\u2019s really about performance and delivering for the clients.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question is from the line of Jeff Harte with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Good morning, Jeff.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jeffery Harte</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Good morning, Harvey. A couple of things. One, we\u2019ve seen the volatility kind of spike on and off for a number of months now. Do you have a sense for how this is impacting kind of client risk appetites and their willingness to transact? And I\u2019m kind of thinking corporate investment and investing clients in investment banking as I suppose it is while in trading.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So, look I think, when you think about investment banking clients and CEOs and Boards and CFOs in terms of how they\u2019re making long-term strategic decisions, that\u2019s really -- that will be influenced by day-to-day volatility and obviously every informational fact is digested. But those long-term strategic decisions are really based more on long-term competitive drive and global growth and that kind of stability. And so, it\u2019s a factor, but as I said when we went to the call we comment with our backlog at the highest point it\u2019s been since 2007 and that should give you some indications of what we think the momentum is in the advisory business. It could always change but that\u2019s where the momentum stands today. In terms of the investing clients and those involved in the capital markets more directly, it\u2019s an interesting question. In periods where there is less friction and ease of volatility -- ease of liquidity, liquidity begets activity, and maybe the language we should we be using is less about volatility and more about volatility and liquidity. Volatility when absence of liquidity is maybe that on friendly version that people are looking to try and find language to describe, and when you have volatility but you have liquidity you can then react and you can execute on the new information you receive. So I\u2019m not sure I got to your questions, but I tried.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jeffery Harte</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. You talked kind of on the M&amp;A, so I mean is it similar for some of the underwriting businesses that it means you\u2019re not seeing the volatility kind of cause corporate clients to maybe pull back on plans there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So, I don\u2019t know if I necessarily say its pointing back on plans in terms of the -- its really more whether the market is more receptive or not. If you really just wanted to contrast underwriting activity in the fourth quarter of 2013 with the fourth quarter of 2014, you just saw capital markets that kind of thundered through the end of the year last year, and this year the capital market just had a lot more to digest. I would say that was more driven by the investing side, basically saying, hey look lets take a pause and lets reassess versus issuers desire to issue at low yield and obviously there was spread pressure on a high yield as people digested the low energy prices, but we\u2019ll see how the year goes. I mean I think at these rate levels and these equity market levels their activity levels could be robust during the course of the year, but again we\u2019ll have to see what the market delivers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jeffery Harte</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. And expenses have been here in a couple of times, but I think kind of maybe more directly my question would be, have we hit a point where we need to see revenue growth to see further profit margin expansion?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Well, it will depend on what happens in the environment. I mean, again we\u2019re going to stay very focused on both lines. And so again, I guess, I could add to that question, and the risk is sounding a little bit cute, and we would have actually grown it and revenues have been flat, and it haven\u2019t really been flat because we\u2019ve been growing other businesses. So, we\u2019ve displayed the ability to do it for the last couple of years. Look, we\u2019re going to be very, very thoughtful as we have been about the balance of investing in the businesses where we see long-term growth. But again that won't -- we\u2019re not going to stop our relentless focus on efficiency.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jeffery Harte</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. And finally we\u2019re starting to hear again some talk of some competitors at least exiting some of the trading businesses and do you see that as a kind of competitive opportunity, I mean does it help you to maybe expand wallet share, improved pricing or is it just some of the businesses aren\u2019t as profitable and we hope eye is going to shrink. Are you seeing some of that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So we\u2019re certainly seeing in various businesses we feel it at least. Again we don\u2019t have full transparency, but in our dialogue with our clients we felt that in commodities this year. We\u2019ve seen it in other parts of the business. I guess, what I would say is in an environment like this, in terms of the competitive dynamic, I think if you want to be in these businesses through the whole cycle, I think some of the takeaway\u2019s are you have to have scale. It\u2019s very hard just to be in cash equities or to be in a very small component of the foreign exchange market. And you have to be able to leverage that scale really across the full franchise. It\u2019s not really just about the equity business, the prime brokerage business or the commodity business. You need technology scale to really be effective through the whole cycle and then you need the diversity because as we\u2019ve seen some pistons will fire sometime and sometimes they won't at other points as we go through this. And so, I know that\u2019s why we feel good about our competitive position because we know our clients still want to trade bonds, and we know they still want to hedge FX and we know they still want to manage their commodity risk. As we work through this part of the cycle it\u2019s just about us being well positioned and having that scale, and we feel like we have it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jeffery Harte</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Hi, Guy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Good morning. Just to follow-up on the VaR question but to ask it in terms of the change for the full year. Can you give us a sense just as you walk through the different asset classes of how much of the change over the course of the year was position reduction versus volatility change?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So you\u2019re saying last year versus this year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yes. So for example, if we look at rates, over the course of the year it fell from 62% to 41%. And I\u2019m just curious how much of that change was reduction in positions versus change in volatility sort of what are the components?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Hey, I apologize. Dane can get it to you. I don\u2019t have the line-by-line in my head in terms of that. But I can tell you on the year-over-year in aggregate, but I\u2019d say what I mean line-by-line I don\u2019t have the specific categories in my head. But year-over-year the -- basically position changes were a reduction that was about three times the increase in terms of the volatility levels. So its real risk reduction.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Got it. Okay. That\u2019s exactly what I was trying to get to and maybe I\u2019ll follow up on the others, but that\u2019s real helpful. On the -- just a housekeeping question, on the core Tier 1, the 12.2% is advanced approach is transitional right. Can you update us on the fully phased?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Sure. So, it\u2019s 11.1% under the fully phased. You want me to give you the standardized that\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yes, exactly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay, fine. Okay, so 11.3% as I said under the transitional for standardized and then 10.2% under fully phased. Now just a reminder on this, fully phased for us is really a conservative expectation, all other factors being equal in other words, we just stood here today with exactly the same balance sheet and nothing changed except for the retirement of funds as we comply with Volcker doing other things. You should probably add back to call it 40 basis points, 50 basis points to those fully funded number -- those fully phased numbers. Okay?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. That\u2019s also really helpful. And the question has kind of been asked a couple of times, but maybe I\u2019ll take a slightly different crack at it. In terms of the volatility that we\u2019ve seen, since the first of the year not just in terms of what happened yesterday in the currency market but more broadly with rates, long rates. I know we\u2019re only couple of weeks into the year, but do you expect a significant rethink in terms of the amount of risk that you and peers will be putting on the desks between now and the end of the quarter, the middle of the year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So, it\u2019s a great question because it allows me just to underscore a very important point. We scale our risk deployment to our client demand not the other way, and so it will really depend on what happens in terms of clients and their perceptions in the marketplace. And again I think it goes back to -- if you compare the third quarter to the fourth quarter. If we see more Septembers, than I think you will see increasing amount of client activity and opportunities for us to provide liquidity to our clients and deploy capital. I think if you see more Octobers and more Decembers, I think you might see less. Again, that\u2019s why we run these businesses for the long-term. I think importantly, one of the takeaways around these businesses is that there are times when things do change structurally. One of the structural changes its been on a decade plus shift to electronics rating and the need for technology. The people still wake up every morning and they want to trade bonds and they want to hedge foreign exchange. Nothing about that is changed. Its just where we\u2019re in the cycle.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Got it. One final question and this isn\u2019t something that you frequently disclose, but there was a disclosure a number of years ago, that sort of in the period between 2006 and 2009, about half of your FICC revenues had been in some derivatives and now that we\u2019ve been through a significant period of regulatory change in terms of derivatives and cost of carry and everything. I was wondering if you could comment for 2014 roughly what percentage of thick revenues would have come from derivative transactions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yes, I don\u2019t have that data handy, but we can dig into it. And if its meaningful we can certainly share it with folks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I mean, I guess, the only follow up would be -- I get that, but is it meaningfully less than it used to be?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Well the one thing I would say that, and maybe these are good things, but host the crises, lots of things they build up in 2006 and 2007 like clients trading correlation and other things which during the crises proved to be less liquid than other things, that certainly looked like businesses that maybe gone forever. You always has been set up but it feels that way for now and maybe they should be. So, there\u2019s certainly elements in the derivative market that appears structurally changed since the crises. But we don\u2019t track that specifically from an auditor perspective, so I don\u2019t have that data.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. Well, thanks for the color though. I appreciate it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question is from the line of Fiona Swaffield with RBC. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Hi, Fiona.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Fiona Swaffield</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Hi.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Hi.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Fiona Swaffield</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Sorry, can you hear me?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yes, no worry.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Fiona Swaffield</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Sorry, some problems with the phone. Can you talk a bit about, I think you said this in the fourth quarter the de-risking helped the RWAs. But I mean, historically you\u2019ve talked about mitigation going forward. So can you talk about your plans kind of Basel III RWAs, and also I know its early days but there\u2019s some new proposals after Basel before Christmas. Do you have any kind of thoughts on those or how they would, could affect you the U.S. bank?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So, on the new proposals obviously we\u2019ll do what we\u2019ve done in the past. We want to be an active and constructive participant in the dialogue with the regulators, but its pretty early days on lots of those discussions. But again, we\u2019ll just participate in that dialogue and you\u2019ll see our comments and things like that. In terms of, I think there\u2019s an important thing to highlight here; there were no businesses here that we\u2019re looking to shutdown in terms of driving improving capital ratios. We feel quite good with the significant progress our teams have made over the last couple of years. Now having said that again this is something that I just think that there is standard operating procedure for any regulated financial institution in terms of having technology, tool, education and a process towards making sure you deploy your capital in a way that\u2019s most impactful for your clients and provide your shareholders with the best return. And so, I think that\u2019s just standard operating procedure for us. So you\u2019ll continue to see us mitigate, but at this stage we made a huge amount of progress, I mean, there\u2019s a whole lots of things I can highlight. I think the balance sheet reduction exercise in the second quarter was a real demonstration of response to nimbleness.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Fiona Swaffield</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Hi, good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Good morning, Jim.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Just quickly maybe if you can talk about some of the other, the more liquidity ratios. Do you have any kind of update on where you guys stand on the LCR and NSFR, have you kind of done any kind of backed envelop stuff with respect to those?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So, in relationship to the LCR which is, we\u2019re in excess of the requirement.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">In terms of the NSFR that\u2019s an interesting one because, obviously if you take a step back in NSFR, obviously any rule that\u2019s supportive of good proper industry wide asset liability management, we\u2019re supportive of, it will be very interesting to see how the rule evolves in discussions with the local regulators because as you know in the proposed rule they came out. There really are, there\u2019s some interesting things in there, one being obviously this notion of how transactions get linked. So we\u2019ll have to see what the final determination on that is when we get that from all the regulators, and also obviously the treatment of deposits where different geographies have different legal and regulatory regimes, and in the U.S. obviously we have a restrictive regime in terms of how deposits can be utilized. So, I\u2019d say on the NSFR it\u2019s a bit of a wait and see.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. I would imagine with you guys given your structure that the TLAC is probably not a problem. Is that a fair statement or?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yes, again where we stand today, again at preliminary rule. Right, so I caveat that with all the facts that we\u2019ll have to see where it goes, but that would be our takeaway and our early read.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. And then maybe just broadly on the pipeline record levels, it sounds like one area advisory is clearly strong. Can you comment on the other areas where you\u2019re seeing, is it -- is debt still holding in there given the financing needs for the M&amp;A environment or how is equities doing? How do we think about the pipeline in the different components?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So, as I said the advisory side of the line was really the biggest driver that\u2019s probably not a surprise for you given all the announced transaction to the marketplace. If you sort of look at it year-over-year, equity was down, debt was up a little bit. But it does feel like at least if the marketplace and asset prices can stay here, it feels like a reasonable environment to me for the coming year. But again these things can change on a dime.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Right. Okay. That\u2019s all I got. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thanks so much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Chris Kotowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yes, good morning. Every quarter we go through this and looking at the capital markets business and rates and credit Zigs [ph] and currencies and equity Zags [ph] and you talked about the environment on October versus November and so on. But when I look at the -- kind of the industry revenue totals on an annual basis, they\u2019re incredibly stable and my peer group is probably the same as yours, but its been somewhere between $110 billion and $120 billion of revenues on an annual basis ever since 2011 and we\u2019re probably like 7% or 8% below 11% now. And it just seems to me like the explanation must be that the buy side is becoming increasingly concentrated, larger entities, more resource, and just like you\u2019re able to measure client profitability, they\u2019re able to measure what they pay all the brokers and isn\u2019t the issue more that there is kind of a fixed wallet that the buy side has on an annual basis and that there is not going to be an environment in the future where they pay a whole lot more than they are now?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Well, I guess the -- we should probably have a long philosophical conversation; it probably requires having a glass of wine or beer or something. But I think that the -- I think that you have to really look at these businesses over very, very long periods of time. And so for example when there was growth, lets just say from the period of like 2002 to 2007, I don\u2019t think clients were looking to pay more, I think they were always very, very obsessed around transaction costs. As a matter of fact, the vast reduction in transaction cost for example the equity business actually occurred during that period of growth. And so, we assume that our clients as fiduciaries are always going to focus on transaction cost. I think that less the issue, I think its much more environment driven. We\u2019ve been in a period of near zero global interest rates for an extended period of time, post the financial crises, and so I think our clients are in some respects as a result struggling for their own after production in some cases which translates again into reduced activity, but our clients have always been focused on minimizing transaction cost as they should be [indiscernible] philosophical conversation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Chris Kotowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay. Fair enough. I mean, if I was right, would you manage your business differently than you are?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Its hard for me to imagine any of our businesses and say, look they\u2019re going to stay exactly the same for the next 10 years. So slightly that will be a nice way to live, but our businesses are just more dynamic than that. We think its part of the competitive advantage of Goldman Sachs just responding to the changes. So, I think its going to be dynamic.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Chris Kotowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">All right. Fair enough.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">It is very difficult sitting here today to predict, like it was a couple of years ago, no one would have predicted the way the M&amp;A that we\u2019re experiencing. But not of course it feels very natural, and now people feel like it will extend. I do think this is a case of all of us, this is a natural inclination to extend the most recent set of data that we have. Now, it was going to stay like this for the next 10 years, can you promise me that? Yes, there maybe, we would even push harder of efficiencies. But again we\u2019re positioning for operating leverage and growth.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Chris Kotowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay. All right. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Good morning, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Hi, Brennan.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So, first a quick one on Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo, lots of increase given what happened this quarter and your involvement in the initial deal. Did that have any impact on the results this quarter at all?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So, in terms of [indiscernible] my result this quarter its immaterial. For us, -- and I guess, I would add in terms of the -- on the fixed side of the business not the primary driver. But for us obviously as you have seen in our public commentary we\u2019re very surprised by the Bank of Portugal\u2019s unexpected and very surprising reversal of its prior written decision on this matter. And so, for us really this is really, it\u2019s the matter of our client, it is not about Goldman Sachs, and so we have clients that relied on those representations and so, we remain in active dialogue with the Bank of Portugal and obviously it\u2019s a very fluid situation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay. But is it fair to characterize it as maybe small but in your view immaterial impact?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I would say not a primary driver of FICC, but obviously in FICC.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">It is obviously part of the revenue decline.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Got it. And then thinking about your physical business on the commodity side, you guys are one of the few left. We\u2019re seeing given some of the dynamics there in that market but improving -- and improving bed for storage, how are you seeing that play out in your physical business as we move forward from here?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">So, we always think of the -- that our focus in commodities is really and we used to think about is divide into two things, investments that we make in terms of things like metro which we sold during the course of the quarter. When we purchased metro, it was always purchased with the notion that we would add value to the enterprise and then ultimately sell metro. That was always part of the strategic design. In terms of our commodity franchise, which we\u2019re as you know very committed to. The focus there is on the hedging of commodity price exposures and working with all those clients globally whether they be corporates or investors. And so that\u2019s really how we think about the strategy. Obviously ownership of physical commodities is getting -- we think is actually a good review by the Federal Reserve. We are very focused on safety and soundness. We think its perfectly understandable that they\u2019re doing the same. But that\u2019s our strategy in commodities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay. And then last one also just on sort of oil. Thinking about the drop here in oil and your M&amp;A franchise, energy has been a pretty meaningful part of the M&amp;A market last few years. What sort of near-term and then maybe a bit longer term impact you anticipate the drop in oil would have to M&amp;A activity from here?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Well I think big picture, the drop in oil which really started in June but obviously it started getting a lot of attention in the fourth quarter. I think at the highest level a lot has been written about the tradeoffs between near-term impact on markets, but obviously a big tailwind in terms of expense reduction and a benefit for the consumer. And so, we talk to our economist net-net, as you\u2019ve seen from us, we think the price decline if it stays here is a tailwind for global economic growth. As it relates specifically to the industry, if we go through a period of sustained declined prices around this level, then clearly its going to put certain parts of the industry under stress. There will be opportunities to help those clients, work through those stresses. There will be opportunities to deploy new hedging strategies, there will be potentially merger opportunities as the organization works through what is really a case of excess supply. So again, its very early days and these things tend to play out over months and years when you get these kind of price declines. But clearly clients will be looking for advice from Goldman Sachs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay, but no specific commentary as far as the M&amp;A outlook is concerned and the impact there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">No, I think it\u2019s a bit early. And I think it will be very specific to certain situations in terms of how we work through the cycle.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay. Thanks for the color, Harvey</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Hi, Harvey. Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Hi. How are you?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Doing well. Thanks. So, I just had one follow-up question on the capital discussion. Maybe looking at it from a different angle, the presentation you guys had given a couple of months ago is extraordinarily informative. Certainly help us think about all the different constraints that you\u2019re managing to. But from your perspective given that your business adjustments that you plan on making are merely going to be tactical at this juncture, and given our understanding of the constraints and the final rules and where they sit today, what do you believe your spot or required capital levels are at the moment to support your business?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">So, I don\u2019t think we should underemphasize the word tactical. I think tactical really means; there are no big strategic challenges over here in terms of businesses that we need to dispose of at this stage. Really we\u2019re quite pleased with the strength of our franchise businesses, and so I wouldn\u2019t underestimate, I wouldn\u2019t mistake tactical for a lack of focus or a lack of opportunity. As I said I think its really a prerequisite to running the businesses now in terms of having a very focused tactical strategy and I appreciate your comments about the presentation we gave. In terms of how we think about long <strong>gone [ph] 15<sup>th</sup> (0:18)</strong> capital levels, obviously the capital levels aren\u2019t finalized. So maybe we should just talk about today's context. In today's context and we\u2019ll see what happens with the finalization of the G-SIB buffers. But in today's context we would be at a minimum of 8.5% and we had a stated buffer of 9.5%. We have been spending time looking at the buffer. I think the 1% buffer probably seems on the high end to us. We\u2019re not going to spend a lot of time on it until we see the final rules. Did that get to your question?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">It does. But presumably given what we know today whether its about CCAR being binding or the Feds latest proposal recognizing that there could be additional changes going forward that 8.5% plus whatever buffer you didn\u2019t appropriate is probably not where your required capital or target is ultimately going to shake out. Presumably it will be higher than that, and not just for you but for industry peers as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Yes, I would agree with that. You didn\u2019t ask the question but again this is a very early read of the proposal that\u2019s out, and so subject to change. So caveat it accordingly. But our early read and interpretation of the documents out there that it would add 1% for us. And so what you said earlier I think is the more important thing which is in terms of a binding constraints, the binding constraint for us is CCAR. And so, we\u2019ll continue to focus very much on all aspects of the capital ratios. But for us the binding constraint has proven to be CCAR.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay. Maybe just one quick follow-up. Is it CCAR risk based or leverage based ratios. It felt as though in the last exam it was leveraged. I didn\u2019t know if you felt that, that would potentially evolve as CCAR changes over the next couple of years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Yes, so -- look I think the Federal Reserve has said CCAR was going to be dynamic and so we\u2019ll see how they made changes and their test has proven to be dynamic. We can only tell you it was constraining last year as you saw publicly because of the leverage test and then you saw subsequently take certain actions and that obviously influenced our activity around the balance sheet and how we had to think about re-pricing that capital.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">All right. Harvey that\u2019s really helpful. Thank you for taking my questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Good to hear from you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Good morning, Harvey. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple of quick administrative follow-ups. Just following up on the prior discussion, have you provided or given any thought just sort of the short-term wholesale funding buffer and how that might effect your future ratios and if there is any meaningful consideration being given within that calculation for the maturity even within the short-term bucket?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">So, as I said before just so we\u2019re clear to everybody, so our preliminary expectation and again I caveat that because this rule is very fluid and its in formation only would add an incremental 100 basis points to our G-SIB buffer.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">In terms of how we\u2019re going -- again I think its really most important for takeaway for everyone to understand the framework for how we think about managing the capital against multiple constraints. So, any time in a new regulatory regime any time we\u2019re deploying our balance sheets you have to be able to think through multiple lenses and view things through multiple lenses, that\u2019s why we created the framework that we discussed at the conference in November which basically ascribes a waiting system to that and that gives us a consistent lens to look at things like the use of balance sheet and the supplementary leverage ratio, stresses from CCAR, Basel III standardized, Basel III advanced. And you have to look at all those things individually at the same time. So, capital management, but the regulators have done an immense amount of work to increase capital levels and make the system safer and as a market participant we need to develop technologies and our philosophy and approach to basically work within that framework and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">That\u2019s helpful. And then a question in terms of operating or operational RWA, a number of your peers mentioned that they had increased operating or operational RWA this quarter. Was that true for Goldman as well?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">No, during the course of the quarter -- from the third quarter to the fourth quarter they were basically essentially flat down a little bit.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Okay. Thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin Ryan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Hi. Good morning, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin Ryan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Just a couple of quick follow-ups from me as well here, so just on the investment banking backlog comments I\u2019m glad to hear that the backlog is where it is. But debt underwriting specifically can you speak to maybe some of the puts and takes of the high bar in recent years and corporate issuance that, that maybe tough to match versus the opportunity that you\u2019re speaking about with M&amp;A related financings and how much of an offset that could represent?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">So of all the things that I\u2019ve been I think really that I\u2019m predicting over the last couple of years, its been the annual question about what we think debt underwriting is going to do in the next year. I think you could easily take a position over the last two years that maybe debt underwriting will be lower than the previous year. But the markets have remained robust. M&amp;A activity can be a significant driver of financing activity. I think if rates stay low and the markets are stable and spreads are tight, I think you could see a very reasonable environment. I think if you see the contrary then obviously it will have an impact on activity, and very difficult to predict from here. I mean rates are very low. So for many issuance its going to look quite attractive over the course of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin Ryan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Okay. Thanks for the color. And then just on comp, some of your peers are talking about changing their methodology around different comp, and I know you don\u2019t specifically disclose level of differed comp, but in a roughly flat year for reported comp, is it reasonable to assume that differed comp is also roughly flat or is there any additional qualitative detail you can provide around how you guys are thinking about the mix there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">So, I think the better way to think about that is, we\u2019ve been consistent in our compensation philosophy for a number of years in terms of really ensuring that our employees and it goes up as you go up through the seniority of the firm through to the partners that you hold a significant amount of equity and there\u2019s been no change of philosophy over the last several years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin Ryan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">That\u2019s fair enough. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Your next question is from the line of Douglas Sipkin with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Douglas Sipkin</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Yes, thank you. Good morning. Two questions, first on fake and I\u2019m just curious for your guys perspective and opinion Harvey. I mean, given the sort of change in liquidity that\u2019s come to these markets in the last, lets call it five or six years since the credit crises. I mean, is your guys position that credit is maybe a little bit more vulnerable to smaller shocks given the lack of liquidity, i.e. I guess energy feels like it was the catalyst really for credit to weaken, but its still only, I mean, its bigger but its only like 14%, 15% of high yield. So, is it more pronounced now credit events given the lack of liquidities at your guy\u2019s perspective or it was just kind of a tough quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">It will be very difficult to anticipate whether or not this is kind of a new credit regime in terms of liquidity trading or it is -- these are sort of one off factors. Its always hard to assess that when you\u2019ve had multiple years of timing credit spreads, very low default rates. I will say when you look to the data I don\u2019t have it on top of my head particularly in Europe where liquidity was little challenged in the third quarter and then it got worse in the fourth quarter. I think because if market moves in terms of price movements they were pretty significant. More significant than you would have thought in terms of the underlying credit itself. And so clearly liquidity played a role in terms of the degree of price movement. But I wouldn\u2019t say at this stage you could draw any firm conclusions from that in terms of any long-term structural changes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Douglas Sipkin</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Okay, great. And then shifting to asset management, obviously a great year for you guys. I was little surprised to see sort of the fixed income bucket on the flow side a little flattish for the fourth quarter and I was wondering, did you guys close some strategies or did something change just given how strong you guys have done obviously with performance and some of your competitors struggling throughout the year, and it still looked like fourth quarter industry wide that phenomena still played out. So I was just curious as to why you guys didn\u2019t sort of have the same flow dynamic you had throughout the first three quarters?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Yes, I even had a chance to dig through sort of competitor results and maybe get more transparency over time than we do, but when we look at it over the course of the year which is really how we think about it. We took in $74 billion of long-term flows of which you highlighted $58 billion came in at fixed income. This could just be the timing of how various mandates that are rewarded arrive. We feel quite good about our performance and our ability to continue to gather assets on the back of that performance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Douglas Sipkin</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Okay. Thanks. Yes, I just want to call out that you had mentioned that you had 754 million of litigation and regulatory expense in the period. Just want to make sure that, that\u2019s all related to investigations and not compliance costs in there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">So that\u2019s all -all-- those are litigation related reserves that we access every quarter and we take a quarterly based on information we have on individual and specific cases. That\u2019s not a compensation build or an expense related to additional compliance people or something. I\u2019m not sure, I understood the question. So I\u2019m just trying to clarify it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Yes, that\u2019s the question. So I mean if those investigations go away is that kind of with the expense savings or be it was kind of more of a normalized level of litigation [ph]?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">As we work through legacy costs, ultimately that is the case.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Okay. And will you be able to put most of the major investigation behind you in 2015?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">So in terms of litigation, you have seen us obviously make progress in the third quarter, we settled with the FHFA. I would encourage you to really dig through our disclosure where we give very vast disclosure around all facets of litigation and status.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Okay, thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Your next question comes from the line of your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Good morning. Please check your line to see if you\u2019re on mute.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Hey, Eric.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Hi, how are you? That\u2019s only like the fifth time I\u2019ve done that in this earning cycle. So you -- I just wanted to follow-up on the RWA discussion and see Harvey, if you could just help me kind of understand what the puts and takes of it might be over the course of this year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Are you saying on a going forward basis?</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p20\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p20\">Yes, on a going forward basis, again I would say there is two things that underscore. The first is we\u2019re going to continue to be very focused on further rule compliance and being efficient about the capital. But a lot of it will be driven by client activity. Obviously, we are well positioned from a capital perspective. And so, we really want to stay front footed at as we to the extent to which clients demand are capital. And so we feel well positioned. Hard for me to tell you what those demands are going to be as we sit here in January, but we feel very well positioned,</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">And in terms of the very broad based reduction in assets that you undertook over the course of this year. Is that -- should we view that as being largely completed or is that something that is still under consideration for you over the course of this coming year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">So immediately\\ we have no media plans to reduce the balance sheet from here, but again that's going to be subject to review continuously. And so again, it will be dynamic. If we feel like we are not getting the proper returns, then we will look to reduce. Its really just about discipline, at the same time making sure that we invest strategically for the long run.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Correct. And then, if I guess get a transition for a moment and in terms of the M&amp;A pipeline, could you give us any sense of the complexion of it is that primarily in country as it more across board. Are we seeing any changes, I guess, the real question is are we singing any changes in terms of the complexion of M&amp;A activity, relative to what we\u2019ve seen over the -- this past year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">I mean, look in terms of year-over-year as you would expect the growth specifically in terms of the backlog, it really came work from Americas and Europe and it was really down in terms of Asia. That\u2019s how I describe a geographic measure, which is probably doesn\u2019t surprising.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">And I mean what is the -- I guess I'm trying to understand is the strategic rational changing at all among corporate Boards and terms of growth orientation versus cost savings orientation or any kind of that kind of strategic level discussion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">I think that its, when we talked to our M&amp;A team, what they will tell you is very industry specific. It can be geographic, but the moment level is quite high and so I guess when you look back at it, I said earlier there were a number of folks who would say look we never see M&amp;A again a couple of years ago and that was just where we want in a cycle, but I think that in a world which generally increasingly stable, low growth, but stable CEO\u2019s and boards will look to grow revenues and a strategic opportunity. The one thing that we\u2019ve seen as part of this past cycle, driven by strategics is large transactions tend to spin-off lots of activity in particular sectors. So I don\u2019t know when you talked to our M&amp;A team. I don\u2019t know they would say, look this is all cost driven or this is all top line driven. It\u2019s a mix of factors that will drive action. The momentum feels quite good.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Your next question is from the line of Richard Bove with Rafferty Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Richard Bove</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Good morning. This is kind of a broad question. So I apologize, after a very long call, but over the past couple of days having getting questions on both sides of Goldman Sachs, if you will. While in terms of structure, one is given everything hat you\u2019ve mentioned about capital and constraints on the business placed by the regulators. Should in fact Goldman Sachs be broken up? And if not, why should it be kept together? The other side being asked, given the high level of cyclicality in the two main businesses of the company, should Goldman Sachs make a major acquisition either an asset management company, or a wealth management company, which we give the company a recurring stream of revenue to eliminate some of the [indiscernible] volatility and its revenues and earnings. I don\u2019t know is it the same question basically which is what should the structure, Goldman Sachs be over the next 4 to 5 years?</p>", "<p class=\"p p21\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p21\">Yes, so it\u2019s a good question and obviously there has been a lot of focus on there. So, I guess, we first have to say -- so, if anything what\u2019s changed today because I think prior to the crisis there was a belief that obviously it benefits to scale and you can get scale and you can have synergies. I think the change that people are focused on now is obviously there is a cost, a capital cost that the regulators are putting on side and so its very natural that the question that you're asking. Now, for GS, I would highlight a couple of things. First of all, we\u2019re just significantly smaller than many of the other firms and our balance sheet at $850 plus billion. Many of our competitors are more than twice our size and we\u2019ve 34,000 employees and they may have hundreds of thousands of employees, and so we are smaller and we are less complex. And as a result, we're somewhat simpler. So what I would say is when we look at the collection of businesses that we have, the way we answer the synergy question is first and foremost through the eyes of the clients. Do we think we provide more value to our clients by having a collection of businesses together or not? It doesn't matter to us when in any given quarter the stock markets may be not valuing one of our businesses as perfectly as we would like it to be. It's really a question of over the long run can we drive shareholder value by having that benefit to our clients. So let's take fixed income and equity as one example. In an environment where its technology driven and the clients increasingly get larger, you need to scale across those businesses. We started running those businesses as a collective shortly after 2000 I think. And so the ability to deliver one technology platform across those businesses have one risk management system, all those things provide us with scale and we think we\u2019re able to execute better. It then feeds into our ability to adapt and develop technology tools around capital, and hopefully we are able to perform well in terms of deploying the firms\u2019 capital. When you think about investment banking, you bundle in. Think about the merger business today. And what we\u2019re able to do for our clients by having the ability to commit the capital and actually deliver to the capital markets and connect investors with issuers. Well, all of these things are very synergistic. Our private wealth business, with our banking business, with our asset management business, these are all things that we think we have synergies in. Now, in terms of smaller or bigger, I think it's going to be environment driven for us. You saw us, you have seen us shrink the balance sheet pretty dramatically thinking you have known us for long time, we used to run at 1.1, 1.2 trillion. We\u2019ve been around 900 and now well below that for quite a while and so you\u2019re going to see us be dynamic about this. If we thought, we could drive more value for our clients and get more scale then we would consider things. I will say now it\u2019s harder obviously because there is the explicit pricing end, if you want to call it tax of incremental capital. You have to be very confident that you can get those synergies in that scale. That answer okay, given the breadth of your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Richard Bove</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Yes, I think it makes a great deal of sense. What about the other foot side of the question, which is where can you come up with a recurring revenue stream that would lower the volatility in your current business mix.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">It\u2019s funny. I can\u2019t help myself big. I know you say there a lot of volatility in our current revenue mix, but we have actually produced $34 billion in revenues for three years running. And we\u2019ve grown the ROE and we shrunk the balance sheet and we\u2019ve increased the pre-tax and we replaced $2.5 billion of revenues that didn\u2019t disappear because of volatility, it disappeared because we sold them. So I\u2019m not telling you its going to always be this stable, but touch wood it feels pretty stable last couple of years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Richard Bove</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Okay. Thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Your next question is from the line of Andrew Limb with Societe Generale.

Good morning, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Hi. Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Andrew Limb</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">I\u2019ve just got a -- good morning. I\u2019ve got a question on the trading book review that mostly the Basel committee is undertaking and whether you could give anymore color on what kind of impacts it might have on the industry on an absolute basis, and also how you stack up relative to your peers?</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">So on the trading book review we think it\u2019s very important obviously and we\u2019re in active dialogue. There\u2019s been the QIS and -- so again its very early on that. So I don\u2019t have any specific comments on the trading book review. I think what I would say is that, and again I think you have to give credit and kudos to the regulators. They have been incredibly productive over the last several years. If we paused a list out for all the regulatory changes, its incredible in terms of the impact on capital, liquidity, trading, top execution facilities and so, one of the things I think we all need to consider is market participants, and when I say that I mean clients, folks like ourselves and regulators is we need to maybe at least think about pausing a bit and digesting the impact of these rules. There\u2019s no doubt that these rules make the system stronger and safer as I said before. I do think there\u2019s a benefit to absorbing how they interact over the long periods of time, because you can't get all those benefits without some cost. We can't necessarily always identify those costs immediately. And so that would be my very high level comment on that. But I don\u2019t have any specific comments on any proposed revisions for the rules.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Andrew Limb</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">And is it something that you\u2019re running internally just to see what the impact is at the moment or is that too early to do that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">So, we\u2019re very consistent on our philosophy and yes in terms of proposed rules. It follows a very normal course protocol for us. We work as constructively as we can with the regulators in terms of trying to provide them with data and dialogue on the impact of overrule. So we\u2019re always active participants and we dedicate a lot of time and people and system and math to the QIS as they come out whether with any rule and we always try and be an active participant in terms of giving good balanced feedback to the regulators in terms of the benefits and cause of any proposed rule, which is very early in this potential rewrite. It\u2019s just too early to comment on it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Andrew Limb</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Okay. And then just carrying on to another regulation the NSFR. I know you said that was early as well, but any thoughts about how that might impinge on your prime brokerage business and in terms of like incumberment to your balance sheet assets?</p>", "<p class=\"p p22\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p22\">Now again too early to tell. We\u2019ll see how it ultimately evolves when we get a local regulation. As I said, a big part of the discussion will be around the treatment of deposits. But look, I think what you\u2019re going to see the world do as they adjust is all firms, not just Goldman Sachs. All firms will look for what we\u2019ll call net stable funding ratio funding, whatever that ends up being defined as. And so, we\u2019ll see how the rule evolves. But look, we\u2019ll adapt. You\u2019ve seen us do it whether it\u2019s the Basel III ratio, the supplementary leverage ratio, all these things. We\u2019ll just -- we still need to see a rule.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Andrew Limb</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">Okay. And then just one final question. Is that target SLR that you\u2019re aiming for heading into the CCAR at all?</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">No. At this stage not. As you saw into the SLR right at this stage, as you saw we\u2019re at 5%. That\u2019s up about 80 basis points in the course of the year, so now we\u2019re complying with 2018. One of the things is we\u2019ll continue to review this. There are whole lots of factors that could improve that ratio from here, but again we\u2019ll be assessing all of our buffers as we get the final capital rules. Again we all interact, right? So, you really want to get to a point of stability of rule making and then you can really set the parameters and dial them in more tightly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Andrew Limb</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">Great. Thanks a lot.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">Thank you. I appreciate you dialing in.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">At this time there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">So, hey everyone. Since there are no more questions, I just want to take a moment to thank all you for joining the call. Hopefully myself and other members of senior management will see many of you in the coming months. If there is any additional questions arise, please don\u2019t hesitate to give Dane a call, otherwise enjoy the rest of your day and a long weekend and look forward to speaking with you our first quarter earnings call coming up in April. Take care everyone. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p23\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p23\">Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs fourth quarter 2014 earnings conference call.

My name is Dennis and I'll be your conference facilitator today. I'd like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today, April 16, 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you. Mr. Holmes, you may begin your conference.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Dane Holmes</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. Today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the Firm's belief regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain and outside of the Firm's control. The Firm's actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the Firm's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our current annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 2014. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, Global Core Liquid Assets, and supplementary leverage ratio, and you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that's posted on the Investor Relations portion of our web site at www.gs.com. This audiocast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Our Chief Financial Officer, Harvey Schwartz, will now review the Firm's results. Harvey?</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thanks Dane and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I will walk you through the first quarter results, and I am happy to answer any questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Net revenues were $10.6 billion; net earnings $2.8 billion; earnings per diluted share, were $5.94, and our annualized return on common equity was 14.7%. The first quarter was dominated by one primary theme, central bank policies. In the United States, the market heavily debated whether 2015 would be the year that the Federal Reserve raises rates. On the other hand, the European Central Bank announced the creation of a \u20ac1.1 trillion quantitative easing program that kicked off in March.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">The prospect of two of the world's largest economies, implementing divergent monetary policies had a significant impact. Market participants reassess the implications for both global economic growth, and as a consequence, the performance of various financial assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Regarding the economic outlook, on one hand, low rates are viewed as providing an important economic stimulus to the United States. On the other hand, a return to normalized rates would be consistent with a strong underlying economy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Looking at the bigger picture, the degree of conviction around a slow but stable U.S. recovery continued to gain support for most of the quarter. The weaker recent jobs report in the U.S. has sparked some debate around the timing and magnitude of potential rate hikes. However, the long term expectation of slow, but steady growth and higher rates, remains intact.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Across the Atlantic, the announcement of quantitative easing in Europe provided some stability and the basis for greater economic growth in the region. The launch of a \u20ac60 billion per month purchasing program provided greater confidence to market participants on the Eurozone outlook. The impact was immediately felt across European financial markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">If you take the European government bond market for example, more than a quarter of the bonds are trading with negative yields today. The equity markets in Europe rallied, as demonstrated by the 18% increase in the Euro Stoxx 50 Index during the quarter, and the Euro reached its lowest level versus the dollar in 12 years. As a result, there was greater activity as clients responded to heightened market volatility.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Given the scope, complexity and significance of these two different monetary policies, it isn't surprising, that there continues to be a robust discussion around the potential impacts.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">For our firm, the focus continues to be our clients and serving their needs. Our clients are placing a greater premium on both intellectual and financial capital, given market dynamics and an evolving competitive landscape. We are committed to providing our clients with superior advice, investment performance, content, market liquidity, and certainty of execution. We believe that our extensive capabilities favorably position us to meet a variety of client needs, in what is certainly a dynamic market environment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Now I will discuss each of our businesses. Investment Banking produced first quarter revenues of $1.9 billion, up 32% from the fourth quarter. Our Investment Banking backlog decreased since the end of the year, but its still up significantly, relative to a year ago.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Breaking down the components of Investment Banking in the first quarter, advisory revenues were $961 million, the highest since 2007. This 39% increase relative to the fourth quarter reflects both the increase in completed M&amp;A, and the strength of our leading global franchise. In the quarter, Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced and completed M&amp;A. We advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the first quarter, including Allergan's $71 billion sale to Activis; RWE's \u20ac5.1 billion sale of RWE-DEA, [indiscernible] Group, and Dai-ichi Life Insurance Company's $5.7 billion acquisition of Protective Life Corporation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We also advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the first quarter; these include, MeadWestvaco's merger with Rock-Tenn for a combined enterprise value of $20 billion; Charter Communications' $10.4 billion acquisition of Bright House Networks; and Dow Chemicals' $5 billion separation of its chlor-alkali and downstream businesses, to Olin Corporation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Moving to Underwriting, revenues were $944 million in the first quarter, up 26% sequentially as equity issuance improved. During the quarter, we ranked first in Global Equity and Equity Related and Common Stock offerings. Equity Underwriting revenues of $533 million rose 56% compared to the fourth quarter, largely due to an increase in secondary offerings. Debt underwriting revenues were essentially unchanged at $411 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">During the first quarter, we actively supported our client's financing needs, leading Santander's \u20ac7.5 billion follow-on equity offering; Chevron's AUD4.7 billion sale of its stake in Caltex Australia; and Berkshire Hathaway's \u20ac3 billion investment grade issuance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our FICC and Equities businesses, net revenues were $5.5 billion in the first quarter, up significantly compared to the fourth quarter. FICC client execution net revenues were $3.1 billion in the first quarter, and included $32 million of DVA losses. Net revenues were up more than 2.5 times sequentially, as client activity increased in a number of our businesses, in response to higher volatility and improved market conditions. Interest rates and currencies were both significantly higher sequentially, as client activity improved amid diverging central bank policies.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Credit increased significantly from a more challenging fourth quarter, as credit spreads generally tighten during the first quarter. Mortgages also rose versus the fourth quarter, although volatility and client activity remained generally low. Given continued trends in the energy markets, commodities improved sequentially, with higher levels of client activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In Equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees and security services, net revenues for the first quarter were $2.3 billion, up 20% sequentially and include $12 million in DVA losses. Equities client execution net revenues increased 50% sequentially to $1.1 billion due to a favorable market-making backdrop with higher levels of client activity, particularly in derivatives. Commissions and fees were $808 million, down 3% relative to the fourth quarter. Security services generated net revenues of $393 million, up 12% sequentially, reflecting higher customer balances.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to Risk; average daily VaR in the first quarter was $81 million, up from $63 million in the fourth quarter. The move up was primarily due to increased market volatility across all categories.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Moving on to our investing and lending activates; collectively, these businesses produced net revenues of $1.7 billion in the first quarter. Following a sale of our investment in Metro International in the fourth quarter, we made a decision that the remaining revenue related to consolidated investments within the other line, was not significant in the context of the I&amp;L segment. As a result, we are now reporting the other I&amp;L revenues within the equity and debt lines.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Equity Securities generated net revenues of $1.2 billion, primarily reflecting strong corporate performance and company-specific events in private equity, as well as net gains in public equities. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $509 million, with roughly $200 million in net interest income and the balance coming from net gains.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In Investment Management, we reported first quarter net revenues of $1.6 billion, essentially unchanged versus the fourth quarter. Management and other fees were down 3% sequentially to $1.2 billion. Assets under supervision remain flat at $1.18 trillion. $7 billion of long term net inflows, driven by fixed income and equity products, and net market appreciation of $6 billion were offset by net outflows of $14 billion in liquidity products.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Moving to performance; across the global platform, 82% of our client mutual fund assets were in funds ranked in the top two quartiles on a three year basis, and 73% in funds ranked in the top two quartiles on a five year basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Now let me turn to expenses; compensation and benefits expense, which include salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as benefits, was accrued at a compensation to net revenues ratio of 42%. This is the lowest first quarter accrual in our public history, and 100 basis points lower than the accrual in the first quarter of 2014. Our lower accrual rate reflects our strong 14% year-over-year net revenue growth and the positive operating leverage embedded in our firm.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">First quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.2 billion, 12% lower than the fourth quarter, and slightly lower than the first quarter of 2014. The fourth quarter included higher charitable contributions and higher impairment charges on consolidated investment entities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Now I'd like to take you through a few key statistics for the first quarter; total staff was approximately 34,400, up 1% from year end 2014. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 27.7%, that is down from a 2014 rate, primarily due to changes in geographic earnings mix. Our global core liquid assets ended $175 billion. Our common equity tier-1 ratio was 11.4% using the standardized approach, it was 12.6% under the advanced approach. Starting this quarter, the lower of these two ratios is our binding regulatory constraints.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 5.3%, 30 basis points above the minimum requirement that begins in 2018. And finally, we repurchased 6.8 million shares of common stock for $1.25 billion in the first quarter. These repurchases reflected the completion of our 2014 capital plan.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As previously announced, the Federal Reserve Board did not object to our revised 2015 capital plan, which includes share repurchases, dividends and other capital actions. In terms of this year's CCAR test, we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.65 per share beginning in the second quarter. As it relates to our share repurchase capacity, one point I want to highlight, is that any potential share repurchases over the next five quarters, will be heavily back-end weighted. As you all know, we do not publicly disclose the approved size of our repurchase capacity. Again, we take this approach for a very specific and practical reason. We don't want our shareholders to view the approved buyback amount as a commitment to return that capital. For us, capital allocation is a dynamic process. If we see opportunities to deploy the capital attractively to support client activity, we want the flexibility to do it, and conversely, if our clients are less active, we will certainly look to return it. our track record on this one, is well established.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Now, before I take your questions, let me offer some closing thoughts. The first quarter has served as a strong start to 2015. The year-over-year increase in net revenues reflects, not only the strength of our franchise, but also our ability to provide high quality advice and certainty of execution for our clients. Our performance this quarter, well just a quarter, reflects numerous efforts over the last several years to adjust our business. We sold several businesses due to regulatory capital implications. We transformed our financial profile, significantly improving our risk based capital. We revamped our capital allocation processes, improving our decision-making and efficiency. We took a hard look at our operating cost, fundamentally changing our expense structure by eliminating costs, reallocating resources, and leveraging technology. We made all these changes, while at the same time, continuing to invest in our global client franchise.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We know that our success in many ways begins and ends with our clients. It\u2019s the trust they place in us and our ability to execute on their behalf that drives our franchise, and we believe that our steady commitment, particularly through these more difficult years, has been critical to creating stronger client relationships. And there is one important thing that we didn't change, our focus on creating shareholder value, our efforts are ultimately a reflection of our commitment to you, our owners. We understand that to create shareholder value, we need to have strong financial footings, be an efficient allocator of capital, and have a world class client franchise. Ultimately, our efforts over the past several years have meant that a 14% increase in year-over-year revenues can contribute to a 40% increase in net earnings, a 48% increase in earnings per share, a 380 basis point improvement in ROE, and finally 9% growth in book value per share over the past year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Thank you again for dialing in, and I am happy to answer your questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p4\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Hey good morning Glenn.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Good morning. Let's start with Investing and Lending, it was pretty darn good. I am curious on the equity side, how much of it was actually realized in asset sales, because it was a pretty active quarter? And then maybe related to that, if you could give the portfolio of breakdown in terms of equity, debt and lending assets?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So, let's just start with the balance sheet; you know that the balance sheet at the end of the quarter for the fourth quarter was $79.5 billion and in terms of debt, that's basically -- north of $50 billion of that is in the debt line. So that's the bulk of the balance sheet. In terms of equity, as you know, we have $4 billion of public equity and $18 billion of private equity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Now, in terms of the performance in the equity line, in terms of the quarter, we don't think of it as much as asset sales, because we make asset sales often, there is a period we are restricted. That's why we are careful to give you the public equity numbers. But basically, when you break it down, give or take 40% of the performance came from those assets that are already public. 40% came from basically company improvements and the balance would come from things like pending IPOs and things like that. That's how I'd break it down for you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">And, what's the disallowed portion or what's the best way to ask how much Goldman still has in the funds that you need to eventually liquidate?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So I think -- I just want to make sure, I am going to rephrase your question to make sure I understand it. I think you're saying that, in terms of -- under regulatory guidelines, under the vocal compliance, that number is approximately $8 billion, and so, a bit of a high class problem, as we have been harvesting, that number has obviously been going up, because there has been good performance. Now remember of course, one of the reasons we were focusing on that with you over the last couple of years is, because the original deadline in that was July of this year. Of course, the regulators have granted an industry-wide extension on that through 2017. So we continue to focus on it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Great. Last one is, on FICC, I mean, the macro products are great, but credit mortgage wasn't, so not exactly hitting on all cylinders as a whole. But it certainly seems like, maybe some of the reduced capacity in the industry is helping you, and so your long term strategy that we all beat you up for the last five years might be working. Could you talk towards what you're seeing in terms of capacity and now that you've seen a pickup involved, clearly [ph], what it means?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So on FICC, I think you're right to say that, one of the things we have benefited from, certainly is the diversity of the businesses. Its not just FICC, its across equities as well, because as you said, even in a quarter like this, where you're seeing improved FICC performance sequentially and year-over-year, you're really seeing it in the macro side of the business, and as you said, not all cylinders are firing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">In terms of us, through this part of the cycle, while you were beating us up, we were spending a lot of time focused on the clients and staying very-very committed to the businesses, and we are seeing it translate through. I don't have perfect visibility into our competitor's obviously, but you've seen the announcements, some things more stark like commodities. But certainly, we are hearing it from clients, and now we are starting to see a bit of it, I would say geographically, certainly in Europe. I know you asked about FICC, maybe take the equity business for example. We have seen a trend in derivatives, and then certainly in a quarter like this, it was pretty significant.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Okay. Thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Thanks so much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Your next question comes from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Good morning Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Hey, good morning Christian.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So to start on maybe CCAR, the Firm has proven very adaptable in managing the regulatory environment. As you think about, obviously, your CCAR results. I am just curious as to what levers you have here to improve your relative positioning?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Sorry, I didn't hear the very beginning of your question, I apologize Christian. Could you just repeat it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Yeah. So my question basically is just on your CCAR ratios. I am just curious, what levers you have to improve your positioning?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Right. Okay, I understand. So as you know, we get very little transparency by design, in terms of how the regulators have constructed CCAR going into the test. One thing of course is, we get transparency on our results coming out of the test. And so last year, you saw us digest that information among other regulatory constraints, and we took very immediate action around the balance sheet, and as you saw in the second quarter, reduced the balance sheet by $50 billion. Every year's test, you learn a little bit more in terms of the results. This year's tests, in terms of the constraints, again this is all public, had to deal with total capital, and so we are again digesting the results, and we will look at that, in terms of how we think about deploying our balance sheet, our capacity and our capital structure, and again, we will go through a process. I am not saying the process will yield the same results in terms of last year's balance sheet actions, but we are going through that same diagnostic process now, with our teams in the businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay. Have you mentioned your clients are placing a greater premium on kind of financial capital, and [indiscernible] execution. Curious to how this is being expressed? Are you seeing a wider bid-ask spreads in the market that give you more business, or something else?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So, as I mentioned, we are seeing it in certain parts. I guess one of the areas I point to, is if you just look at the capital we committed to block transactions during the course of the quarter, obviously there were some significant capital commitments we made to clients during the course of the quarter, the largest block transactions that were done. And so, we felt very well positioned to connect those sellers or issuers of equity, with buyers on the other side.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">I'd say more broadly, the process of repricing has been maybe slower than folks would have expected. We are certainly seeing it in parts of the business, and when you start to see it, is when the market picks up. So again, I highlight the derivatives activity, which was a solid driver in our equities client execution line this quarter. We have also talked about it in commodities for example. So in the comm markets, you don't see it as much. But when activity picks up, you start to see it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Great, very helpful. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Good morning, Matt.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Any more color you can give us in terms of the strengths within equity, derivatives, from a regional point of view, should we assume that it was in Europe, from QE and some of the movement in prices there. Just trying to piece that line item together a little bit more?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Yeah so, within equities, the performance was really broad based in what we saw this quarter. We talked for a long time with you about -- to really be a significant player in this, you need to have scale and you need to -- for example, be in all the business lines, whether its prime brokerage, derivatives, ability to commit capital which I just spoke about, you need to have strong electronic capabilities, and you need to be geographically diverse. And this was a quarter, where we really saw strong contribution across the entire business, and I highlight derivatives in Europe, because it was a driver, and we hadn't seen it recently, but that's really a sum of it, but was really broad-based, and it really leaned into the strength of our business. And again also of course, we had a weaker Q1 last year. But it was a solid performance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. And then just separately, in terms of the comp-to-revenue ratio coming down, I mean I feel like symbolically its important that the ratio came down the first quarter, which hasn't for several years. So just how are you thinking about, what the target is, in terms of operating leverage? You said, a focus on generating positive operating leverage, but I think it was more than two times to one, so you had a lot of margin there to say, play with?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So, the 42% at this stage is our best estimate. We did reduce the competition expense last year from 44% to 43%, and then this is 42%. And again, we have always talked about the fact that, the compensation is going to be driven by performance, and this year with the 14% year-over-year increase in revenues, that's our best estimate.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Now in terms of the operating leverage, this has been years of hard work, in terms of managing expenses, really thinking about how to most efficiently use the resources. And so, when you have that in place and you get the revenue uptick, obviously, its much -- you can more easily translate that into the bottom line, and that's what you're seeing this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. Thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Good morning Harvey. Just a follow-up on the equity [indiscernible]. So it sounds like you mentioned the derivatives, you mentioned blocks; I just wanted to make sure on the block side, was there anything that was way outside, when you look at whether its maybe quarter-over-quarter, because year-over-year, you know, you had a weak comp?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">No. As I said, prime brokerage balances were up. There were a number of drivers in volume and activity. But it was really client driven. So there were index rebalance, transactions that we do. This quarter, we were able to facilitate large volumes for clients. It just came together nicely.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. And then -- I think it was the last quarter, but you guys gave some of the repositioning that has taken place in the past couple of years, the revenues that were lost. Then you guys have also mentioned, a lot of the investment that you are making on the technology side, to position for a lot of these new roles. When you think about, what is expected of the industry, at this point going forward, do you feel like most of that is in place, and I guess what I am trying to get at is, if you are already positioned for that, then from the client or the market share standpoint, maybe that's one of the things that's driving it, as a lot of other firms are still trying to figure things out. So wanted to get a sense of, where you guys think you're, given all these conflicting regulations, and how well you can manage them, at this point, given what you know?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So, let me start with technology, because obviously technology has been a critical driver and part of our operating infrastructures are firm for as long as you have been covering us and well before. And that investment is not something obviously you can do in a short period of time. So this reflects decades of investment in technology platform as you know. We have talked about this in the past, Mike, we have one risk management platform SecDB, which certainly gives us some efficiencies in scale, because as we adapt, if we need to build things for our equity business, or if we need to build things in different parts of the world, it obviously goes without saying, that you can be more efficient as you replicate those things.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So its that constant reinvesting in the business that gives us that flexibility, but that's not new. The regulatory component obviously, as we get into the finalization of rules and the implementation of rules, that will continue to be an ongoing process; when we think about technology away from the narrow subset of regulatory compliance, which plays obviously a mentally critical role. The other way we think about it is, really how do we deliver to clients, and that again, we continue to invest in, and then other than being efficient, are there ways we can grow revenues from technology, and so we are constantly monitoring that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay, that's helpful. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thanks Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hi. I am just going to ask a real basic question; how sustainable were your results in each of the four business lines? You already said, the investment banking backlog is a little bit less than at year-end. So as you look at it compared to the prior quarter, should we expect this higher level of performance, or is this just the usual first quarter bump and that we are going back down to a lower level?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So lets just take Investment Banking, Mike; so you remember, at the end of last year, we talked about the fact that we had 1 trillion announced transactions and there was a $200 billion gap between us and our next closest competitor. So in the first quarter obviously, you would expect to see a certain of those transactions coming through. I would point out that the backlog is up significantly from last year. And so, in terms of the backlog in the quarter, it was down a little bit in investment banking, and then it was up across equity underwriting and it was up across debt underwriting.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">[Indiscernible] about the backlog, in the way that you described it, but for example, if you asked the question slightly differently, you said listen, the trend in banking, does it feel like its still in place? The short answer to that is yes; when we talk to CEOs and Boards, CEO and Board confidence continues to be high, and you've even seen in the last couple of weeks in announced transactions, there is a fair bit of activity out there, and we feel very well placed for it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And on the trading side?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So, on the trading side I'd say the same thing; in terms of trends, this discussion around diverging monetary policies, which is a catalyst. That trend feels like its in place, and the client dialog and in terms of our communication, we are very focused. But in terms of you extrapolating that in terms of the quarter, its very early in the quarter, and so all these things, as you know, are going to be driven by the environment, and ultimately, how our clients respond to that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Then one follow-up question; the PSUs are new with an 11% hurdle for ROE and this quarter you had a 14.7% ROE. So is that PSU hurdle high enough, how did you come to that? Do you consider that kind of a target for the firm?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I am glad you asked that question; because we have had this discussion around target. And as we said before, a call wouldn't be complete, unless we talked about something about a target with you Mike. So really important, the PSUs that you mentioned, which I am sure you saw in the proxy, that is not a target for the firm; and that's an important distinction for everyone to understand. The reason we don't have a published ROE target, is because it's just not how we manage the firm. If you recall, all the time we spent in the fourth quarter, talking about our ROE framework, in terms of how we think about capital management. That's a much better way to understand how the firm thinks about most efficiently deploying its capital.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So in terms of the PSUs, as for the proxy, our Board engaged with shareholders actively as they always do, and they took that feedback in along with other constituents, and they felt like adding those metrics to certain executives in the firm, made sense from a shareholder perspective.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">All right thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">The other thing Mike I'd say on ROE target, its interesting you know; if we'd had an ROE target out there, and again, because you and I have gone through this so many times. If we'd had a target out there, we had an 11.2% return last year. If we had a target out there of 13%, and we had our 14.7%, I don't know how you would digest that. We really view 14.7%, it\u2019s a good solid performance for the quarter, its close -- we are really in mid-teens territory now. But our aspirations to deliver for our shareholders are higher. And so -- again, that's why we don't have a specific target. We really think about how to drive value over the long run.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">All right. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thanks Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Hey, thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Hey Betsy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Hey good morning. Hey, a couple of questions. One is just on the fundamental review, the trading that Basel is currently engaged in and wanted to get your thoughts on, how you see that going, and if it goes into places its currently outlined, how you deal with that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So we have obviously been actively involved with the regulators, as does the industry broadly on the trading book review. I think its too early to extrapolate anything from the QIS in terms of any final rule. Our discussion, we think its important -- its really about calibration in terms of how folks want to actually think about the next round of a rule set. But as you have seen us do in the past, whenever we get a final rule, we will work within that rule set. I think that -- as we think about these rules that impact businesses where we require to have inventory, again we got to think about calibration, because we need to think about market liquidity and the industry's ability to provide that, so that has been a discussion for us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Right. Just because it feels like the hedging is a little bit clunky, not really treating risk as you would want to manage it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yeah I would say, let's give regulators time on this, I don't want to pre-judge anything. There is still a lot of work to do.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. And then just separately, maybe speak a little bit to how you're thinking about the commodities business? We have had some recent headlines from some of the regulators on that. I know that you're very committed to a client oriented business. But could you just identify how much of -- what your commodities business generates today is client facing?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So the driver -- I mean, our commodity is all about the clients. As you know, we have sold certain assets, and that's really the driver and when we talk about commodities within our fixed income business, that's what it is. I think -- look, its an interesting time to be having this discussion around commodities and regulation, because as we have seen really since the first quarter of last year, we start to see volatile natural gas markets, then followed by this huge decline in the energy markets over the last six plus months.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I think it really reinforces the needs for firms like Goldman Sachs to be in a position to provide our clients with liquidity, with financing capacity, and so for us, as you know, we have been in the commodity business forever. We know how valuable it is to our clients, we are hugely committed to it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">In terms of regulation, we will see how the regulation evolves, and again, we will stay in active dialog with the regulators. But I think at this stage, everybody sees how critical it is, and how important it is to clients. That's what I would say.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Good morning Harvey. Question for you first of all on the buyback comment you made and the idea of backend loading, and I was wondering in the context over the last couple of years, where it has tended to be more consistent. What prompted the rethink? Is it something to do with CCAR, reinvestment opportunities that you're seeing? Just a little color on that would be helpful?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">As you know, year-to-year, the CCAR test changes. Obviously I can't speak to anything at supervisory level detail. But there were aspects and nuances of this year's tests, that to the extent to which we use our capacity, that we would use our capacity later in the year. Now this is public of course, the Federal Reserve gives you capacity on a quarter-by-quarter basis. And so, I was just letting you know, that due to nuances in this year's test, largely driven by the fact that we are mark-to-market firm -- we mark-to-market our balance sheet, that the -- to the extent to which we use it, it will be more back-end weighted.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. So it has more to do with that, than the idea that with business levels picking up, you're seeing more opportunities to deploy capital in the business?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">No. I was specifically speaking in a CCAR context, with the expected capacity. Of course, as you know when you look at our long history, as a firm, for the vast majority of our history, we have reinvested capital into the business, and so to the extent to which we continue to see growth in client demand, obviously that's our preference.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Got it. Let me ask you a litigation question; you certified a $190 million in the quarter, can you give us a sense for how much of that is the reserve build versus just incurred costs?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So we don't break it down specifically at that level. What I will tell you, it\u2019s the same process. We continue to evaluate any outstanding litigation in the course of the quarter, and we accrue accordingly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And how should we think about, the fact that in the most recent quarter, one of your major competitors said that they were in negotiations with the Department of Justice on private label mortgage securitizations. And really at this point, if we assume that they do what they are in negotiations to do. The only major U.S. dealer that wanted to have done one of those settlements is Goldman. Should we be thinking that there is probably going to be something coming down the line in the next few quarters, that you're in negotiations?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So again, to the extent to which on any specific cases, we are not going to comment. I am sure you understand that. I would really encourage you to look at the most recent 10-K and our Q disclosure, where we are very explicit about all these matters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay, fair enough. And then, the final question I had for you is just on the tax rate. You talked about geography and obviously, we have seen tax rates similar to -- that you had this quarter in the past. Would it be appropriate for us to sort of factor that in together with the norm for the first quarter together, with the normal kind of low 30s and be thinking in terms of something along the lines of 30% for the full year, or would you expect this tax rate to continue?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So it\u2019s a good question. So just for everyone who may have not had a chance to be [indiscernible] beginning of the call, effective tax rate for last year was 31.4 and for the quarter was 27.7, and as you have pointed out Guy, that was mostly driven by geographic earnings mix.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">What I would say is, all factors being equal, in terms of the full year rate, and the way you should think about it, given that we are starting from such a low level, I think its reasonable to assume that we come in below last year's rate. But we will see how the year evolves.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. That's really helpful. Thank you, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Sure, thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Hey good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Hey Jim.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Just maybe circling back to FICC. FX [0:41:31] rates are very strong, which you obviously highlighted as did everybody else, credit, mortgages being weak year-over-year, but we had an environment where, I mean, I guess that if you look at sort of trace volumes being up, credit spreads were pretty stable. What's really, I guess, hurting that business, is it just simply, there wasn't enough volatility, or just absolute low rates are hurting spreads, or is it -- clearly inventory levels are down, or is it a combination of all those things. Just trying to think what is a better environment do we just need to see higher rates?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I think this last quarter was really a case of investors evaluating, clients really evaluating, where they used to be, with respect to their portfolios. There was obviously less refinancing activity during this quarter versus a year ago. But I would say the key driver is the debate overrates and how people are thinking about their portfolios. I think if we saw a path towards normalized rates over time, I think you could see a pick-up.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. So we just kind of need to wait and see rates get a little -- more conviction about rates and predictability. And just maybe a bigger picture question on the banking cycle and M&amp;A. Clearly, we have seen a nice pickup and continued in the first quarter, where do you -- in terms of conversations with clients, do you still think there is a lot of juice left in, I think if you look at past cycle, this would imply we still have quite a bit of room to go. Just want to hear your thoughts on it, if you --</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">You're right. In terms of -- if you want to use the benchmark path cycles, certainly there is room for increased M&amp;A activity. In terms of our discussions with CEOs and Boards, I would say that the momentum feels still quite good. There is large transactions within industries tend to be a catalyst for other transactions. Strategies are very well positioned, in terms of driving synergies, the financing markets remain attractive. Again -- so, there is room here, and our recent dialog is quite good, and as you point out, there is room versus sort of historical benchmarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay, great. That's helpful. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Chris Kotowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Hi. Good morning. Just wanted to circle back to the equity client execution, because the result is just so discontinuous with -- though its roughly double the last, say, eight quarter moving average. I mean, can you say -- was it just a unique opportunity set, was it a couple of big transactions, was it related to the block transactions that you were talking about earlier, or is this more like the new normal?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Look, we will see how the subsequent quarter goes. I would say that, look, if we looked at last year's first quarter, it was definitely a more challenging market-making environment. Again, this is really just one where, geographically, from a derivatives perspective, the ability to commit capital. Things just really lined up quite nicely for our franchise; and again, it was broad based. So the environment was good everywhere. Doesn't mean it can't get better and doesn't mean it can't decline, but it was good everywhere this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Chris Kotowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. And then on a kind of a global macro-view back in 2011, I guess the prospect of a Greek default inside the Eurozone and crisis and we seem closer to it than ever. Is it now in your view, a non-event, if and when it happens, that everyone has had enough time and preparation to get ready for it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">It\u2019s a complicated question. I would say, first of all Greece has been in view for a long time for folks, so people have had an opportunity to digest it. I think that, on the plus side, the environment in Europe versus 2011 is dramatically different, in terms of -- if you think about the discussion around other peripheral countries relative to 2011. And so I think, those are all things on the plus side. We are obviously monitoring it very carefully.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I would say, on the concerning side, look, its an experiment that hasn't been run, and so we will have to see what it has for markets. But its certainly, if we compare this to 2011, you'd have to assume that, the risk is much more contained, given people have had years to focus on this.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Chris Kotowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Good morning Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Hey Brennan.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So quick one on thinking about equities here coming into 2Q, typically strong, given dividend season in Europe. How much do you think that QE on the continent is going to play into that this quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Well clearly, it was a big driver in terms of increased confidence in Europe, and you saw that immediately -- that translated immediately into big uptick in European equity markets. We will see how much pull-through that has during the course of the quarter, but clearly it has been in focus for our clients now, and so we will see how much stamina it has. But obviously the commitment to QE is substantial.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Sure. And then, sorry about bringing it back to equities here, but one more; can you just speak to what sort of impact Asia had on the quarter, particularly given some of the market structure changes we saw in the region?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So, certainly it was a contributor, if I ranked it for you, it was -- Europe was a more significant contributor. But the trend in Asia, has been much better, obviously. And as those markets continue to liberalize, I think the dynamic nature of capital flows will continue to increase. Of course, it was helpful in Asia, but again, this was broad-based across our equity business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Longer term, we are pretty optimistic about the opportunities there though.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Terrific. Thanks a lot.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Hey, good morning Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Hey, good morning Steven.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So I just had a question on CCAR and your preferred issuance plans. With total capital under CCAR specifically, now the binding [ph] constraint for the firm. Even though you're already operating at that 150 basis point preferred target, is it fair to expect that you will look to close the gap, or improve your CCAR position by issuing more preferreds or more qualifying debt?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So you may have seen, or you may not have seen, Steven, but we are actually -- we announced this morning, we are out in the market with preferred. So that transaction is out in the market now, and we will be closing later this afternoon. In terms of how we think about this, this is a great question, because as I said before, a lot of this is about how you digest the CCAR results and how you think about -- again things like, how you price the balance sheet, how you deploy your capital and the optimal capital structure. And so, you should assume we are going to look at everything, in terms of how we position the firm going forward as it relates to the capital structure, make sure we do -- we construct it in a way that's most efficient for our clients and most efficient for our shareholders.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">That's really helpful Harvey. And actually, in that same vein, since you mentioned about capital allocations under CCAR, it might be helpful if you could clarify, regarding how you allocate the capital under your attributable equity framework. Under CCAR lines, do you use for your stressed end of [ph] period or your minimum ratio for determining the level of required capital for assessing the adequacy of the ROEs for various trades?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Right. So some of this obviously, we consider proprietary in terms of how we think about the dynamic nature of capital management. But for the folks who haven't studied, and obviously Steven is a very thoughtful consumer of the information. In terms of our return on attributed equity framework, what we have discussed with the marketplace, is basically all those factors that contribute to regulatory capital constraints, Basel-III advanced, standardized, supplementary leverage ratio, elements of CCAR. We had weightings [ph] to those, given their significance and we basically have constructed an algorithm that helps guide us, both in executing certain transactions, and obviously how we evaluate businesses over the long run. But we haven't discussed the specifics of how we incorporate those variables.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. Well that's it for me Harvey, thank you for taking my questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question is from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Good morning Matt.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Good morning Harvey. Just a question for you, in terms of what's going on in the capital markets with your businesses, specifically on the energy side of things. We have heard from a number of more commercially oriented banks so far this earning season about what's going on with their borrowing and capital markets activity within that sector specifically. I am curious given what's happened in the last two to three quarters in the oil markets, have you seen a meaningful increase in those companies coming to market, or has that been much more status quo?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I can't comment specifically in terms of the [indiscernible]. What I will say is, obviously given our role in commodities and our role -- energy companies and industrial companies broadly, the activity level for the past several quarters has been extremely high. Often what you will see is, given sort of this really very steep decline in the oil price, is, those things won't translate immediately. But over time, obviously the industry adjusts that, and then you begin to see things like merger transactions and capital actions. And so, the activity level -- the dialog is quite high, but I can't point you to any specific transactions that I would highlight.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. And then just switching to investment management; you mentioned that there was an outflow on liquidity products. It seemed a little bit larger than what we have seen from a couple of other peers. I guess I am curious if you can just give us a little more color on that, and does -- what happened over the last couple of quarters with the flows, presume a somewhat higher normalized pre-tax margin in that business, relative to the high teens that you typically put up?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So in terms of the flow, as we said, there was $13 billion of combined net inflows and market appreciation, offset by $14 billion in liquidity outflows. Those flows can move around, as clients reallocate assets and move back and forth. I think if you look at the historical movement around those predominantly mutual fund assets, you will see flows like this historically, so I wouldn't point to any meaningful indicator.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">In terms of the margins of the business, obviously this business remains strategically a very high priority for us. We have been investing in it for years, and we continue to see progress; and over time, we expect that you will see margin expansion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. And then just finally for me, was there any material change this quarter versus the fourth quarter in the benefit to your Basel III ratios from a significant financial institution deduction that you said was about $5 billion last quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yeah, that's not the key driver in this quarter. It really is the growth in equity. It\u2019s a [indiscernible] driving it this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. Thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Good morning. Just a quick question on the capital ratios; can you give us what the fully phased-in capital ratios are, what's the RWAs?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Sure. So fully phased-in is 11.8 and 10.6. Now again, we just got a question on the significant clients for institutional deduction, and so when you look at that, that between the transitional, I would say, the best way to think about it on an apples-to-apples basis, assuming all other factors being equal, you should assume that the fully phased-in versus transitional would roughly be around the midpoint of that, because we get the benefit of the significant institutional deduction, as we move money out of funds.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">In terms of RWAs on the quarter, for advanced $565 million, and standardized $626 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. And towards the [indiscernible] 5.3% and the kind of the constraint ratio for CCAR has moved up the total capital. Do you have a sense of what the buffer is that you would run the SLR [ph] at now, could you get away with a 50 basis point buffer, since the total seems to be constraining?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">We haven't finalized a buffer in terms of how we are thinking about that. And so, we will have to see how that evolves, in terms of how we want to think about it. But obviously, there has been significant progress, and we are above the 2018 minimum requirement.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Great. All right, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question is from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Thanks. Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Good morning Eric.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">One of the dominant themes from Goldman last year was the very significant reduction in its balance sheet size. And so I am wondering how -- if we should be thinking about that differently at all, at this stage, given what you're talking about, with respect to client interest and demands, but relative to the capital constraints that were highlighted under the CCAR and I am assuming were the genesis for today's preferred offering. How should we think about all of the dynamics with respect to balance sheet size?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So the balance sheet reduction we went through last year, it\u2019s a great -- I am glad you brought it up. That was about repricing the balance sheet, and all about this framework we talked about, in terms of how we deploy our marginal capital. And so, if you think again about last year's test, you could grow equity, you could grow capital, but the reality is, you obviously -- you want to do that in a way that delivers marginal returns. And so, that was all about repricing, and so as we went through an exercise last year, that was repricing [indiscernible]. If we again -- our preferred operating position would be to grow the capital base, grow the balance sheet accretively and deploy that capital to clients. but obviously, we are going to be very sensitive to returns on that, and how that marginal balance sheet gets priced.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">But it sounds like, from your repricing commentary, you do see that at least on the margin occurring?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Correct. Well we certainly have seen some in terms of pricing, and then last year, we felt the discipline of the process we went through -- went quite well, as we talked about, there was very little disruption to client activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Great. Thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin Ryan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Hey, good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Good morning Devin.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin Ryan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Good morning. Just one the ROE outlook and the drivers, obviously your margin is a big one, and the pretax margin for all of last year is 36%. It was 37% this quarter, which I thought was impressive. So we just look at the businesses, that have more of a granular level, are there are areas where you feel like you're getting to about as good as it will be, and then where do you see the biggest areas for additional leverage to the margin?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So the discussion around how we manage the businesses and where we think about driving additional leverage, that's a continual conversation at Goldman Sachs that's going to happen all the time; because we are always reviewing the businesses, and making sure we are driving them to the ultimate outcome. Now, to the operating leverage you're seeing, that's firm-wide, and really is the result of, again, the years of investment we made in technology, how we scaled the resources, the cost cutting programs that we announced several years ago that was raised, and several billion dollars. And so, you are now just starting to see all that translate through. But we are constantly evaluating the businesses for opportunities, both to grow and to hold.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin Ryan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. Thanks, and then just coming back to Europe one last time, the stability that's helping client activity, is there any way you can just help size that for us relative to the recent past; how much stronger was it this quarter, we talked about derivatives, but where else does that pickup, and any perspective around how much bigger it was this quarter, relative to the recent past?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So I highlighted it to give you some sense of the underpinnings of the activity that's driving it. But again, in equities, it really was broad-based client activity, geographic and across the business and within individual product lines.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin Ryan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thanks Devin.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question is from the line of Kian Abouhossein with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kian Abouhossein</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yes hi. Just coming back to equity derivatives, I was wondering if you could just give a little bit more flavor in terms of products, if the strengths on the execution side came maybe more from the flow side, or was it more from the delta one side or structuring side or dividend swaps; can you just talk a little bit through the products in order for us to get a better understanding of what we should think about going forward trends, in some of these areas? Because clearly, some of them are a bit more bulky than others, if I may?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Really Kian, its truly client activity across each of the businesses. So I wouldn't highlight any particular product line within the derivative businesses. Obviously, when you have a big up move in European equity markets like you did with QE, obviously that's an opportunity for clients to get involved, and there is lots of things they look at, both from a [indiscernible] perspective and a more structured perspective. I think if you try and answer your question around things like where, people are more interested in derivatives that had maybe multi-variables, sure. But again, it was broad-based, it wasn't any one particular driver.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kian Abouhossein</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And there is no real distinction between structuring with this flow, in terms of -- your mix not much significantly changed?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I won't talk to our mix, because the firm obviously, we have the intellectual capital on the systems, and the capacity to point that capital for clients. And so, I think we are always well positioned for those parts of the cycles in the market. But again, broad-based in equities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kian Abouhossein</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yeah. And in respect to fixed income, we have had some things giving us a bit of a steer in terms of how the revenues breakdown between macro and credit, and I was wondering, could you give us a bit of a feeler as well? Is it half-half at this point in the first quarter, or should we think about it differently?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">We don't provide a detail by macro versus credit. What I would say is that -- look, we have an investment in all these businesses, and again, we benefited from the diversity. At times, credits can be particularly active, and at times, macro is going to be particularly active. But we don't provide disclosure in terms of that split.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kian Abouhossein</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And lastly, on commodities. Clearly, commodities had an uptick in volatility, but at the same time, you highlight volatility as a business which year-on-year was down. I am just wondering, if you could just explain a little bit to me, why commodities was relatively weak on a year-on-year basis?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So you may recall that last year, and I was going back to the first quarter 2014, commodities had a very strong quarter, a lot of that is we discussed at the time, was due to the extraordinary volatility of natural gas. And it drove a lot of client activity in the sector, and that was really the first time you and I started talking about the fact, that we were really seeing the absence of competitors on the field, and a huge uptick in client dialog. And so you're just coming off a very strong 2014 first quarter, but commodities remains a very active space for us, and our dialog with clients is quite strong.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kian Abouhossein</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. That explains it. Thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thanks Kian.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Thank you. I want to ask you, one thing that you highlighted in the press release was the largest ever NPL -- largest increase in five years in tangible book value. Would the increase in returns and still continue constraints on capital deployment, isn't that really a fundamental accelerator, as you look forward over the next couple of years?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So again, the environment is going to -- ultimately something that we participate in. But I would say that again, the thing that we have focused on over the last several years, which has been making sure that we continue to invest in our client franchise, and at the same time, build operating leverage. That's why you're seeing that. You're seeing the 14% year-over-year growth in quarterly revenues, and its just translating to the bottom line, with a lot of operating leverage.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And then, when you look at the comp ratio at 42%, once you made some improvement with what you've done in the past, but when you look at it on the average for the year, you have recently highlighted, then on the 38% kind of number. In that, you would look for the year being closer to what you've done in the past couple of years. When you see that you almost have $0.50, $0.60 of earnings per share that's basically pushed forward as you review performance in your compensation plans over the rest of the year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So its our best estimate today, Mosby, and we will evaluate the year as we go through and obviously again, as we have discussed in the past, the culture of pay for performance at Goldman Sachs will evaluate it continuously as we go through, and it will be driven by performance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Thanks Mosby.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Since there are no more questions, I just want to take a moment to thank all of you for joining the call. Hopefully, I will be able to and other members of senior management, we will see many of you in the coming months. If you have any additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to Dane. Otherwise, enjoy the rest of your day, and look forward to speaking with you on our second quarter call. Take care now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs first quarter 2015 earnings conference call.

My name is Dennis and I'll be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today, July 16, 2015. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Mr. Holmes, you may begin your conference.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Dane E. Holmes - Head-Investor Relations</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm's belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain and outside of the firm's control. The firm's actual results and financial condition may differ possibly materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">For discussion of some of the risk and factors that could affect the firm's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our current Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, global core liquid assets, and supplementary leverage ratio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">And you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that's posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com. This audiocast is copyrighted material to Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Our Chief Financial Officer, Harvey Schwartz, will now review the firm's results. Harvey?</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thanks, Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I'll walk you through the second quarter and year-to-date results then I'm happy to answer any questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Net revenues were $9.1 billion, net earnings $1 billion, earnings per diluted share $1.98, and our annualized return on common equity was 4.8%. For the year-to-date, net revenues were $19.7 billion, net earnings $3.9 billion, earnings per diluted share $7.93, and our annualized return on common equity was 9.7%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">In the second quarter, we recorded net provisions for mortgage related litigation and regulatory matters of $1.45 billion. Despite these charges, book value per common share was up 4% relative to year-end 2014. Excluding these litigation charges, net earnings were $2.3 billion, earnings per diluted share were $4.75, and our annualized return on common equity was 11.5%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">The second quarter of 2015 was another example of the benefits that come with having a diversified global client franchise. Certain businesses showed year-over-year strengths while others faced headwinds.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Investment Banking and Investment Management net revenues increased year-over-year by 13% and 14% respectively. The increase in net revenues within these primarily fee-based business s largely offset net revenue declines and are more capital-intensive businesses with a 6% year-over-year decline in Institutional Client Services and a 13% year-over-year decline in Investing and Lending.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">The benefits of diversity were even demonstrated at a business level. For example, strength in advisory and equity underwriting more than offset the year-over-year decline in debt underwriting, which was lower versus a record last year. And for Institutional Client Services, revenue strength within equities helped offset a difficult operating environment for FICC. Ultimately, we continue to benefit from our diverse set of market leading businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">If you look at our first half results, excluding the $1.45 billion litigation charge in the second quarter of 2015, you can see the embedded operating leverage, with expenses flat relative to revenues that are up 7% compared to last year. You can also see the improvement in several underlying performance metrics.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">These include a 440 basis point improvement in pre-tax margin, a 27% increase in net earnings, a 31% increase to diluted earnings per share, and finally, a 220 basis point improvement in ROE, to 13.1%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Now I will discuss each of our businesses. Investment Banking produced second quarter revenues of $2 billion, 6% higher than a strong first quarter. We continue to see the benefit of our leading global franchise, with second quarter revenues at the highest level since 2007.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Our Investment Banking backlog was down slightly compared to the first quarter and remained higher year-over-year. Breaking down the components of Investment Banking in the second quarter, advisory revenues were $821 million. The 15% decrease relative to the first quarter reflects a decrease in completed M&amp;A.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Year-to-date, Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced and completed M&amp;A. We advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the second quarter, including BHP Billiton's $12.7 billion demerger of South32; Synageva Biopharma's $8.4 billion sale to Alexion Pharmaceuticals; and Imperial Tobacco Group's $7.1 billion acquisition of certain cigarette brands and other assets of Reynolds American and Lorillard.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We also advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the second quarter. These include BG Group's \u00a347 billion acquisition by Royal Dutch Shell; Altera Corporation's $16.7 billion sale to Intel Corporation; and Pall Corporation's $13.8 billion sale to Danaher Corporation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Moving to underwriting, revenues were $1.2 billion in the second quarter, up 27% sequentially, primarily due to debt issuance. This was our second highest quarterly performance in underwriting. Year-to-date, we ranked first in global equity and equity-related and common stock offerings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Equity underwriting revenues of $595 million rose 12% compared to the first quarter, due to an increase in IPOs. Debt underwriting revenues of $603 million improved 47% quarter-over-quarter, largely driven by an increase in leverage finance activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">During the second quarter, we actively supported our client's financing needs. Leading Qualcomm's $10 billion debt IPO, Daiichi Sankyo's $3.2 billion sale of its stake in Sun Pharmaceutical, and AIG's $3.5 billion sale of its stake in AerCap.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our FICC and Equity businesses, net revenues were $3.6 billion in the second quarter, down 34% compared to the seasonally-stronger first quarter. FICC Client Execution net revenues were $1.6 billion in the second quarter, and include $153 million of DBA gains.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Net revenues were down substantially from the first quarter, as client activity declined across our businesses and market-making conditions were more difficult. Within interest rates and currencies, a shifting macro backdrop negatively impacted client activity and results. While currency has experienced a significant decline, client activity and interest rates, though sequentially lower, remain solid.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Credit was significantly lower, as credit spreads generally widened during the second quarter and activity levels declined. Mortgages also declined versus the first quarter, as volatility and client activity remained generally low. Commodities decreased significantly, with reduced levels of volatility and client activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In Equities, which includes Equities Client Execution, commissions and fees, and security services, net revenues for the second quarter were $2 billion, down 14% quarter-over-quarter and included $32 million in DBA gains.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Equities Client Execution net revenues decreased 30% sequentially, to $787 million. Client activity levels remained high this quarter, though not as high as the first quarter. Commissions and fees were $767 million, down 5% relative to the first quarter. Security services generated net revenues of $443 million, up 13% sequentially, reflecting seasonally-stronger client activity and higher customer balances.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to risk, average daily VaR in the second quarter was $77 million, down from $81 million in the first quarter, reflecting a decrease in commodities and interest rates.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Moving on to our Investing and Lending activities, collectively, these businesses produced net revenues of $1.8 billion in the second quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of $1.3 billion, primarily reflecting strong corporate performance and company-specific events in private equity, as well as net gains in public equities. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $547 million, with roughly $225 million in net interest income, and the balance coming from net gains.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In Investment Management, we reported second quarter net revenues of $1.6 billion, up 4% from the first quarter. This represented the second highest quarterly performance for Investment Management. Management and other fees were up 4% sequentially, to a record $1.25 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Revenues benefited from a higher average mix of long-term fee-based products relative to liquidity products. Assets under supervision increased $5 billion, to a record $1.182 trillion. Long-term net inflows of $14 billion, largely driven by fixed income products, were somewhat offset by net market depreciation of $3 billion and net outflows of $6 billion in liquidity products.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Moving to performance, across the global platform, 76% of our client mutual fund assets were in funds ranked in the top two quartiles on a three-year and a five-year basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior-year equity awards and other items such as benefits was again accrued at a compensation to net revenues ratio of 42%. Second quarter non-compensation expenses were 59% higher than the first quarter. Substantially all of the increase was related to litigation charges.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Now, I'd like to take you through a few key statistics for the second quarter. Total staff was approximately 34,900 up 1% from the first quarter. Our effective tax rate for the year-to-date was 31.2%. Our global core of liquid assets averaged $181 billion. Our common equity tier 1 ratio was 11.8% using standardized approach. It was 12.5% under the Basel III Advanced approach. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 5.7%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">And finally, we repurchased 1.2 million shares of common stock for $245 million in the second quarter. As discussed last quarter, related to our share repurchase capacity, any potential share repurchases over the next four quarters will be back-end weighted.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In closing, a few comments. The second quarter of 2015 provided its share of opportunities and challenges. On one hand, our results reflect a continuation of some positive macro trends. Our Investment Banking clients remain focused on their strategic alternatives. There is also a strong demand for financing solutions. We see solid client activity in equity products, particularly outside of the United States, and there was a growing need for active investment management options.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">On the other hand, the operating environment for our FICC clients was more challenged in the second quarter. The combination of current concern surrounding Greece's widening credit spreads and the reversal of certain macro trends led to lower client activity and a more difficult operating environment. More recently, market participants have been focused on the Chinese economy. This follows the more than 30% decline in the Shanghai Index during the early part of July from peak levels in June.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Against this mixed backdrop, we remain focused on driving value for our shareholders. Year-to-date, excluding litigation charges, we have posted strong results in many of our key investor metrics, including earnings per share, ROE, and book value per share.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As we have mentioned many times before, our management team isn't overly focused on any one quarter or, for that matter, any six month period. Our focus is on the strength of our global client franchise, the quality of our people, and the long term trends driving our businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Regarding trends, we see many opportunities ahead. For example, the competitive landscape is in significant flux. In addition to strengthening the banking system, one of the positive things the regulation has achieved is leveling the competitive playing field.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">The world changed after 2008. We began to adapt to this new world immediately, and particularly to comply with new regulations. As part of this process we also scrutinized each of our businesses with the goal of both improving the client experience and our ability to generate appropriate shareholder returns.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We started early, we cut costs, we on-boarded new regulations, we sold businesses, and we developed a new capital framework. At the same time, we have been able to both expand and deepen our global client franchise.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As much as we are focused on the present, we are also focused on the future, and we enter it knowing we have a great set of businesses, we have tremendous client relationships, we have world-class people and execution capabilities, and last but not least, we have an improving competitive and operating landscape.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Thank you again for dialing in, and I'm happy to answer your questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p4\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Ladies and gentlemen, we will now take a moment to compile the Q&amp;A roster. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn P. Schorr - Evercore ISI</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Hi. Thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Good morning, Glenn.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn P. Schorr - Evercore ISI</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Good morning. So pretty darn good all around. I think FICC and I&amp;L take a lot of everyone's focus, but in FICC specifically, I wonder if you could help us, how much of that was a late quarter phenomenon? You spelled out what fell off in credit and mortgage, things like that. How much was a late quarter? How much have you seen some stabilization or reversal so far? And then most importantly, I think last quarter you felt really good about market share in client facilitation side of the business, and I'm curious if you can give any comments on parsing that out, the facilitation versus the marks in the quarter? Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">So in terms of timing of the quarter, we came off a strong first quarter, as you mentioned, and then we came in basically you saw a number of factors. I think the most significant one, obviously, Greece in the headlines continuously. And that certainly weighed on spread sensitive parts of the business like credit and mortgages. Early in the quarter, obviously, there was a big reversal in the macro trend with respect to how people were thinking about currencies and interest rates. And that was really more an interest rate differential and what's the Fed going to do discussion. And so it's not surprising that we saw reduced client activity in the quarter and obviously more difficult market-making environment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">In terms of \u2013 it was really more pronounced as the quarter went along as Greece really dominated the headlines and liquidity was challenged in parts of the market. And so it was really \u2013 it was more of an end of quarter phenomenon. Too early to tell in terms of where we are in this quarter, Glenn, but obviously, the news around Greece has been obviously very positive in the last couple of days. And so hopefully some of these trends are behind us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn P. Schorr - Evercore ISI</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">And then I think you talked about the competitive landscape in flux and we all see what's going on at each and every one of the European banks. I think your franchise composition is different in general. You see it in results this quarter, and mostly good. Just a question on the European shrinking. Do you want what they're shrinking? In other words, theoretically, they're going to shrink the tougher parts, the lower ROA types of the business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So in terms of how we think about it, and obviously these competitive trends they take years to really formulate. But I think the big change and I talked about this a little bit in my script, but to be more specific about it, the capital-intensive parts of the business and really let's just start with the fixed income parts of the business, given the regulatory demands around that part of the business to deliver for your clients and drive appropriate returns for shareholders, that is actually where we think the competitive advantage is most significant.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So if you just look at last year's collective industry ROEs, which are in the mid to higher single digits. Our relative position both the strength and the franchise but aggregate position of the firm just positions us quite well over the next couple of years if firms follow through on what they saying and they actually restructure and they begin to redesign those businesses. And so, as people exit the business, obviously, the impact of the marginal pressure on risk when you're deploying capital should be beneficial and we're leaders in all those parts of the franchise, but I think this is going to be a multi-year phenomenon.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn P. Schorr - Evercore ISI</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Okay. I don't want to put words in your mouth, but it sounds like there might be more volatility, but in the end, your shareholders are going to love the fact that you are bigger in some of those areas.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Well, we feel very confident about the business. That's the way I would describe it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn P. Schorr - Evercore ISI</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">All right, thanks. I respect the one and one. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Your next question is from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) LLC (Broker)</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Good morning, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Hey. Good morning, Christian.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) LLC (Broker)</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Hi. So my first question is on the CCAR and G-SIB \u2013 possible G-SIB's surcharges. So I'm sure you're aware that this chatter that that could be included in the CCAR process going forward. You know, you have been or Goldman has been pretty proactive in optimizing for CCAR, be it preferred issuance or reducing the gross balance sheet, but what are the levers can you pull if G-SIB buffers are included?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So as you pointed out, we obviously have been pretty dynamic with respect \u2013 I think the greatest example was a year ago when we brought the balance sheet down by nearly $60 million in the quarter. And that was predominately driven by CCAR and that was a repricing exercise, which led us to do that. So the way we'll think about this is a couple ways. First of all, it's only preliminary and we'll have to see the final rule, but our expectation is that at this stage given the information that we have, again preliminary, that any incremental buffer will be roughly 1%. And so, relative to the peer group, obviously, that puts us in a good position.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Now in terms of how to think about the implications for the test, we have no visibility into how the Federal Reserve is going to change the test. And so to the extent to which it changes, we'll look at all the same levers again. There will be an evaluation of how we should think about the capital structure of the firm, how we should think about how we're deploying our capital, how we think about pricing the marginal balance sheet and other aspects of our business. But we won't do that in advance of any changes in any regulatory rules. And we just don't know what they're going to do yet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) LLC (Broker)</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay. That's helpful. And then litigation costs, so how should we think about go-forward litigation costs? I guess over the last four quarters, you've averaged about $200 million per quarter, just given the big charge this quarter, all else equal, should we expect that run rate to slow down a bit?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So obviously, we took a significant charge this quarter. The vast majority of that is related to the RMBS Working Group. But the process with respect to these kind of legacy cost issues is, every quarter, based on the best information available, we create our best estimate and it's very case-by-case dependent. And so it can be somewhat unpredictable quarter-to-quarter. That's how I'd frame it for you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) LLC (Broker)</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay. So it doesn't sound like anything changes in terms of just kind of look forward here?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">I'm sure you understand this, Christian, given that these are \u2013 this is active litigation, very difficult for me to comment beyond what I said.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) LLC (Broker)</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">That's fair. Okay. Thank you for taking my questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Thanks so much, Christian.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael R. Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Hey, Harvey. Thanks a lot.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Hey, Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael R. Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Hey. Just on the equity trading, so year-over-year, the strength was pretty significant. I think you mentioned a few drivers of that. But just wanted to get a sense, are you seeing any, either market share gains in that part of the business or is it more environment and clients' investors getting more active in the asset class? I know you pointed to Asia, but I just wanted to find out if there was anything else driving that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">No. I think, obviously, it has been a good solid couple of quarters. Environmentally, for the first half of the year, the environment has clearly been better, both from a activity level and also from a market-making perspective, and so you're seeing that. The franchise is very diverse, both geographically and product line. And so I think when market activity picks up, you're just seeing the value of the franchise pull through. And as I said earlier, as activity has picked up outside of the U.S., I can't tell necessarily whether or not it's share pickup from other firms, but obviously, you've seen actually in the first quarter even, those firms with strong equity franchises seem to be getting the lion's share of the activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael R. Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay. Got it. And then just two kind of minor items, but on the legal cost, you mentioned this reserve, and it's always tough in terms of the outlook. But when you think about some of the major things that you guys have put behind you, and even the industry, when we think about the run rate going forward, are the majority of those items behind you? And then on the tax rate, just wanted to understand, if I exclude the item related to the legal reserve, it looks like the core tax rate still was relatively low versus expectations, in line with last quarter. So is the revenue mix away from the legal charge still beneficial? Meaning it's still coming in in lower jurisdictions? And so does that, for the full year, should we be thinking about that continuing?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So with respect to tax, you're right. It's roughly consistent with the first quarter and we're running below last year's full year, so you're right about that. That's both earnings-mix driven, and an election. You'll see in the earnings release this quarter with respect to certain earnings that we'll leave overseas. With respect to litigation, again, the charge we took this quarter is \u2013 the vast majority of that is related to the RMBS Working Group. And I'd really encourage you to look through our disclosure, and while I wish I could give you more detail, obviously, that's one significant item, a legacy item, that we look forward to getting behind us. But I really can't comment in more detail on that, given it's a live discussion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael R. Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. All right. Thanks a lot.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Hey, Mike \u2013 Matt, sorry.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Maybe a bigger picture question, on your traditional bank strategy, you had a key hire on the consumer side, or former consumer person. Maybe just talk about what you're thinking there on traditional bank strategy in general?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So, yeah, as everyone saw, we hired Harit and we're thrilled to have someone of his experience and caliber on board as a one of our partners. I would say at this stage, it's very early days and we've really done two things. We've identified a potential opportunity and we've identified a key hire, as I said, which we're very excited about. When we look at new opportunities what we look for in terms of making that evaluation is, what core competencies do we have and how can we bring them to any client base that we deal with. And so, we feel like there is a couple of strengths here that we have.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">One, we have a long history and a core competency in risk management. Two, we have a very, very big commitment to technology. Three, historically, we've been pretty good builders of new businesses. And, obviously, as it relates to, let's just call it the space of digitally-led consumer finance, we have no legacy cost, we have no legacy infrastructure to deal with. And so to the extent to which we can work with Harit and develop a strategy, which we believe is accretive to the firm and valuable to clients, we'll pursue it. But at this stage, it's early days. Harit's just on board, and so we'll be back to you with more details as things develop.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And then maybe separately, you mentioned head count was up just 1% linked quarter. Year-over-year, it's up 8%. Obviously, it's not causing any expense pressure as the expense management's been good, but just remind us just where those people are being added? And I guess are they more kind of junior, lower salaried staff?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So, the 1% increase in the quarter and the longer term increase it's really happening in two places. Part of it is driven by our growth in the Investment Management business and people that we've been adding there as that business continues to grow and our ongoing investment there. And really the other large portion of it relates to resources that we needed to deploy as we come into the more significant part of regulatory compliance. And so, these are all the new rules that the industry is affected by over the next couple of years. And so it's a bit of a surge, if you will, in terms of having people on board. And for example in the second quarter, about three-quarters of those folks were in places like Salt Lake City, Bangalore, and other locations.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Sorry, three-quarters of the people in the reg-related staff or of the additions?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Of the additions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Got it. Okay. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hey, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hey. How are you?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Good. I just had a couple of quick questions. One was on the G-SIFI buffer that you talked about earlier on the call. I just wanted to see \u2013 did you give us an update on what you think your surcharge is? I thought you were \u2013 before the most recent commentary it was like 2.5%. Are you saying now it's 2%?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">No, no. Same. No change. We don't have any incremental information. We think it's \u2013 obviously, we started with 1.5%. Under the proposal, we believe there's an incremental 100 (29:17), but again, I cautioned you that's the preliminary. We haven't seen the final rule, obviously.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. Got it. All right. Just wanted to make sure of that. And then on European competitors fading some of these businesses over time, how much does that matter to you when you think about the fact that the SIFI surcharge is in part a relative charge? So they fade naturally, you're going to grow as a percentage of total business. How much room is there to take on new business given the way the SIFI surcharge is structured?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yeah, it's a great question, Betsy, and obviously, a difficult one to think about over the next couple of years. But obviously there may be some unevenness in the playing field depending on how the rules actually get rolled out. But in the end, it's more about I think how you deploy that capital and the returns you're able to generate. And I think one of the reasons why, as you point out, we're seeing potential big restructurings on the European side is that even without the SIFI charge potential that we have in the United States \u2013 and who knows what they'll do over time, maybe the playing field will be completely level \u2013 they're struggling in those businesses at current capital levels. (30:35).</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Now, our commitment to Europe is very significant. And it's not just across the capital intensive businesses, but it's the entire integration of banking. And when you think about Europe over the next several years as they work through what is \u2013 our research folks have them at 1.5% growth, but as they work themselves more and more away from the crisis, this is a very good environment for a firm like Goldman Sachs where clients need sound advice across all of our businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yup. No, I get that. All right. Hey, thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hey, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hey, Mike. How are you?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Good. You ended your prepared remarks saying the world changed in 2008, you cut costs, you implemented regulation and the implication is others are now catching up, implying a little more bit rational pricing, which you've said on prior calls. Can you just give us a description of the areas where you're seeing the biggest repricing or the areas that you're watching the most?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So it's a great question, Mike. And I think it's very clear at this stage that the increased regulatory requirements, however you think about them, but let's just think mostly in terms of capital, while obviously very good for the system and significant improvement for all firms. For example, Goldman Sachs was carrying 85% more capital than we did prior to the crisis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">As we said, they have leveled the playing field a bit, but even without the leveling of the playing field, it makes balance sheet at one point, depending on the metric, and capital itself more expensive. And so, I don't know if it's an intended or unintended consequence in terms of the regulation, but the regulation does reprice things. And the vast majority of the industry is really a handful of us that are earning above the cost of capital, whatever you want to call it \u2013 8%, 9%, 10%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And so we're starting to see repricing come through now. We saw it mostly in balance sheet. Came a little slower than we would've liked, but it's starting to come through in balance sheet. By balance sheet I mean things like those businesses that were maybe most mispriced relative to the new requirements. Things like the repo business, it's extended into the prime brokerage business. Again, that's a regulatory heavy business. We're world-class in that business, but it is regulatory heavy business. And you have seen it in parts of the derivative business particularly in things like those transactions requiring or not requiring collateral. So I'd say it's slow. These are not huge needle movers, but this feels like a trend that's in place for a number of years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So would you call this as an increase in your cost of goods sold that you're passing on to customers?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I think that's probably a reasonable way to say it. I mean our clients are very sophisticated. And when you sit down with them and you say, listen, everyone in the industry, Mike, that issues preferred they are issuing them slightly north of 5%. That's expensive shareholder capital to fund the leverage of your balance sheet. And so, it's pretty easy to explain to people how actually the returns that you have to require on business. And so what we think will happen over time is potentially repricing, but also the competitive dynamic looks like one where those firms that can't deliver or can't respond or don't have the same quality franchise, they get removed. But anyway, this is going to be a \u2013 this will be a long process. We went through a pretty substantial repricing as you know (34:17) last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And last follow up on this. Can you give a sense of magnitude? Are we talking basis point or tens of basis points or what?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Too soon to quantify. As I said, this is not big needle moving. It's more, I would describe it more as a trend for the balance sheet and capital intensive parts of the business. And you'd expect it given the regulatory constraints, so.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">All right. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thanks, Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research US LP</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yeah, good morning. I don't want to beat a dead horse, but on the litigation question, the litigation charge, presumably to add that much based on the Working Group issues that you referred to, there must have been an event, a point in your discussions with them that began to give you a sense for a figure. And I was just wondering if that's a correct assumption?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And also does your view of kind of the your \u2013 where your litigation reserve stands now relative to what you will ultimately need, is that affected in anyway by the New York Court of Appeals judgment on statute of limitations which came down during the quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So again, and I'd like to share more with you but obviously this is active discussion. With respect to this quarter, again, every quarter we incorporate all the information we have, Guy. And obviously we received information that resulted in us taking this charge. I know you've looked and you've read all of our financial disclosures in the past. And so I would encourage you to go back to that. But as you know, based on that we have not historically taken reserves for the RMBS Working Group. And so obviously we got information during the course of the quarter that led to this realization.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research US LP</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then on, just to follow up on an answer that you gave earlier. That 1% that you gave in terms of the G-SIB buffer, which I think what you were saying was that is your working assumption as to how much would go into the CCAR, sort of the increase, the stress minimum in CCAR. Is that right? So you're thinking that 1% out of your 2.5% G-SIB buffer is how much you think is likely to get added to the stress minimum in CCAR?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So, again, the 1% was based on the preliminary. We'll have to see the final rule, so I really want to emphasize that. In terms of CCAR, we just don't know how they're going to include it, what they will do, whether it will be offset. We have no visibility and we'll all hear when the Federal Reserve announces any changes that they plan to make.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research US LP</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. Fair enough. And then just one more if I might just on the SLR. You made a lot of progress on your SLR in the quarter relative to where your core equity tier 1 ratios moved. So you are now 70 basis points ahead of the minimum. You increased 40 basis points in the quarter. Can you give a sense of some of the things that you did presumably to the denominator to continue to tighten up there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yeah, so on the SLR, the 70 basis points, if you break that down, roughly 20 basis points really comes from capital and the issuance of preferred and then the balance are all things that drive the ratio, things like notional (38:10), collateral back and forth and things like derivative. And so, there's a lot of give and gets in there but accretive for the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research US LP</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. Great. Thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Hey. Good morning, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Morning, Jim.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Maybe just circling back to equities in China, we've had a \u2013 obviously as you pointed out, a big selloff and most of you and your peers have talking about equities being driven by strength in Asia. Have you seen any change in the environment and activity levels given the big selloff, or has that just helped \u2013 the volatility helped? Just trying to think through how that should be thought of going forward in terms of the equity franchise.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So again, whenever you see these kind of market reactions, obviously, it has some impact in terms of how clients think through their portfolios. It's more isolated, obviously, to the onshore market. And I think that \u2013 at this stage, I would describe it as being pretty fluid and dynamic with respect to the near term.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I think longer term, what we're really focused on is the extent to which the recent events, do they really have a significant negative impact from an economic perspective or in terms of the liberalization policies, because obviously we have a very big focus on China, a big commitment there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And our early read of all this is that it's not going to have a big \u2013 when we talk to our research folks, it's not going to have a big impact on the local economy, and we don't expect a major change in sort of the focus on liberalization. And given everything China's done, maybe we should expect as they go through this, there were (39:51) going to be growing pains from year to year, but the long term trend feels okay to us. From a...</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yeah, that's \u2013 okay. That's helpful. And maybe just circling back to the \u2013 I know it's early days on the lending side, but historically, you guys have shied away from retail risk, right, with regulatory and higher legal risk. This seems to be a bit of a departure from that historical viewpoint. So could you maybe just walk us through your \u2013 clearly there's an opportunity to make money, but the question is how you view the potentially higher risk in a retail lending format?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yeah. So we've always been very cautious, and you're right to point that out. Now we do have millions of clients that touch us in our investment management business through our mutual funds every day. And so they're actually a big part of what we do. And when we think about it, obviously, we're going to move very cautiously in the space and make sure we get things right, because you're right to point out that, like any new business, there are risks and we want to make sure that we work with the consumers and the regulators in absolutely a first-class and best-class way. And so \u2013 but again, too early for us to identify any specific parts of the market. But we'll be back to you with more details again down the road.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. Great. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Good morning, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Hey. Good morning, Brennan.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So first question, you made some reference to it earlier when you talked a little bit about pricing, but it looks like we're seeing some momentum in your Prime Brokerage business. Clearly, the current quarter was a bit seasonal. But could you give some color to that? Is some of it down to pricing? Is it down to other factors? Maybe, could you help us out a little around there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I really think there's two drivers. The biggest driver is just the quality of the franchise. And so, we've been a beneficiary of getting balances just because of the \u2013 really the longstanding history and our involvement in this business, and it's global for us. But pricing is an important input, but it's not the primary driver of the performance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. Thanks for that. And on I&amp;L, pretty solid, especially given some of the action we saw in markets this quarter. Can you \u2013 was a lot of it harvesting? Were there any particular regions that contributed? For example, was Asia a contributor in the quarter on the I&amp;L line?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So, in terms of I&amp;L, and why don't I just run through it, I can run through it from the debt line through the equity line. So in the debt line we had $547 million, roughly $550 million in revenues in the quarter. And remember, I underscore for you there that roughly $225 million of that is interest income, okay, and the rest is gains in sales.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">In the equity line, of the $1.25 billion, roughly a third of that actually comes from public market shares that we own, in entities we've already taken public. And so there you're just seeing the idiosyncratic performance of the portfolio. And another third \u2013 and I'll just break it down for you in thirds \u2013 a third is the public portfolio performance. A third is things that we refer to as event-driven, like actually taking a company public or making a sale, and the other third is performance-driven. And so the idiosyncratic nature of the portfolio, the team is just doing a very good job here.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Terrific. Thanks for that color, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian M. Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Great. Thank you. Hey, Harvey, earlier you mentioned that you saw that liquidity was challenged in parts of the market when you were talking about the FICC business. Can you give a little bit further color as to maybe what regions and which products that we saw the liquidity dry up?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So, it was most challenging in Europe. The credit market in particular, and let's just say the spread sensitive product, the markets aren't as deep there, obviously, as they are in the United States. And then, with all the issues with Greece, liquidity was quite challenging for all of our clients, and quite challenging for market makers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian M. Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. And then also in Europe, are you impacted by the UK bank tax and the higher \u2013 it looked like \u2013 if you look at the Goldman Sachs International?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yeah, so it's an important part of our business, obviously, given our presence in Europe. Too early for me to quantify anything for you, but obviously the tax rate's going up over there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian M. Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">But is that $2 billion that you had in profit on ordinary activity before taxes in Goldman Sachs International the right number to look at when you're thinking about the potential impact on tax rates?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I have to come back to you on that in terms of exactly the number you look at. I believe the answer to that is yes, but why don't I have Dane follow up with you, and we'll make sure we reconcile that for you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian M. Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Great. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question is from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Thanks very much. Harvey, a couple of follow-ups, please. On your non-comp, core non-comp expenses, it looks like they came in under the consensus estimate by about $120 million this quarter. Should we consider all of that improvement to be core, or did some of it perhaps relate to slowing volume or activity over the course of the period?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">No, not driven by slowing activity. Any changes in non-comp that you're seeing away, obviously, from the legacy charge, that would have to do with impairments that we might take from time-to-time, is the real driver there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. And in terms of the incentive fees in the Investment Management segment, I'm sorry if I missed this earlier, but did you explain why they were so strong in this quarter, because that's not typically seasonally the case?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yeah. So there's always two drivers to incentive fees. There's going to be the normal or what we'll call year-end incentive fees that you're used to seeing. And then there are fund specific events where we've above a certain performance metric and then we'll begin to recognize those fees. And so this is very fund specific in terms of this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. And just lastly, one of the metrics that we, and I imagine others use to gain some insight into the M&amp;A outlook is the index of CEO Confidence which has been generally moving in a straight line up until recently where it took a dip down. I'm guessing may be because of Greece and other macro events, but I'm wondering does that index accurately reflect the tenor of conversations that you've been having with \u2013 in corporate board rooms over the past few weeks?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So when we talk to our M&amp;A bankers, the momentum in the advisor side of the business feels very strong. The CEOs and boards are obviously going to incorporate all the relevant news and so not surprising to me that when you see Greece dominating the headlines and lots of volatility in the markets that you might see some dip in confidence. But in terms of the degree of conversations we're having in the activity levels, it feels quite good. And you see that halfway through the year, in announced transactions, the Investment Banking team is actually we have announced $112 billion plus of transactions, actually more than the next competitor. And so the dialogue for us with our clients is pretty robust right now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. Thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question is from the line of Richard Bove with Rafferty Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Richard Bove - Rafferty Capital Markets, LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Good morning, Dick.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Richard Bove - Rafferty Capital Markets, LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Hi. This is more of an accounting question. Basically, your Investment Banking was up quarter-over-quarter, commissions and fees were up, your principal transactions were up, and obviously there was a big jump in your debt underwriting. And yet there was almost a $200 million drop in your net interest income. And I'm just wondering why that would be? what are the accounting recognition that would allow that to happen?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yeah. So you're looking at the GAAP income statement, Dick, obviously. And that has a lot to do with under the GAAP rules, how we have to treat certain hedges versus the portfolios. We have to break out certain hedges and move them into the market making business. So it ends up being a net offset.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Richard Bove - Rafferty Capital Markets, LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I see. So this is interest income loss on hedging?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">(48:48) The hedges are hedging parts of the portfolio, so you might get a decrease in the underlying, for example, the income being driven by the portfolio, but then you pick it up in the hedges offsetting that portfolio in the market making business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Richard Bove - Rafferty Capital Markets, LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. But the market making in the FICC side of the business was down 49% so...</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Correct. That may be completely unrelated to the interest component. That's why in the script, Dick, I break out for you in the investing and lending segment, that net interest income was $225 million in the lending businesses to try and clarify it. I'm happy to have Dane walk you through it but it's an accounting aspect.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Richard Bove - Rafferty Capital Markets, LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. And then the second question would be, basically, I understand trading is not totally related to underwriting, but when you have such an incredibly strong increase in underwriting of a certain segment like that, and at the same point in time the FICC income goes down fairly substantially, it would suggest that what you're underwriting is something that isn't traded?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">No, I wouldn't draw that conclusion. Usually the secondary activity flows for a long period of time, Dick. I think it's hard to draw those kind of conclusions in an individual quarter. I think if you look at our that debt underwriting activity in the first quarter, it wasn't as strong as the second quarter, but yet the FICC results were stronger. And so, if you look at FICC, for example, on a year-to-date basis, it's down. But the second quarter was definitely tougher for us, Dick.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Richard Bove - Rafferty Capital Markets, LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. All right. Thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Hi. Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Morning, Steve.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So, Harvey, given the challenging market making backdrop that you experienced in 2Q, I was wondering how that informed your thinking around the issue of trading liquidity more broadly. And I might be interested in hearing some of your thoughts regarding the recent feedback that we've heard from regulators as well as some of the results based on their recently-conducted studies.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So, obviously, there has been a whole host of discussion around liquidity in the markets. And I think in the end, I think it leaves us quite frankly all with more questions more than answers. I think you can point to some very specific parts of the market where you can say regulation has impacted liquidity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I think, the best example of that is the government bond repo market. I think it's hard after that to point to a specific regulation and say, oh, this regulation has impacted liquidity in this market. That doesn't mean it's not happening. I think it's just hard to quantify. I think the repo market you can easily quantify it. You can see the reduction in repo commitment from various banks, including ourselves, and you can see over quarter-end how repo spreads react.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">By the way, to me that looks like that's an intended desire by the regulators. They wanted people to either reprice or shrink that business. And so I think away from that the reason why this is difficult is because it's a question of really what is the multi-year accumulation of regulation?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Things being pushed more electronically, inability to hold as much balance sheet, increasing RWAs, all these things so vocal. But I think these things reveal themselves over many years. But obviously, you can't have as much regulation as we've had and not have some unintended consequences. I think it's just the cost of regulation. Doesn't mean the regulation is not good.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Understood. And maybe just switching gears for a moment. Just wanted to dig into some your comments that you made on the debt underwriting side. You cited strong DCM really driven by higher leverage finance activity, which is certainly a nice surprise just given some of the regulatory pressures in that area. I wanted to get a better sense of how you're thinking about the outlook for the business more broadly. And one of the questions we hear most often is whether the recent pickup in activity is more tactical driven versus a reflection of what could be sustained strength in that business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So, you're right to ask that question and the question's been coming up for the last couple years, obviously, as we've gone through this part of the cycle with tighter credit spreads and lower rates. And we talked about this. If the M&amp;A cycle remains strong, then obviously that will be a positive tailwind to the underwriting business. And it was for us. When I said leverage finance activity, I could have said leverage finance activity facilitated in part by our advisory business. So if the M&amp;A backdrop continues the way it feels today \u2013 but I think M&amp;A will help.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">All right. That's it for me. Thanks for taking my questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thanks, Steven. Take care.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Hey. Thanks. Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Morning, Devin.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Most have been asked and answered, but just a question on the market volatility. We hear the term healthy volatility versus unhealthy volatility in the market. So can you help us think about what you think could drive that healthy volatility that seem to be missing? It seems like every time we have one of these macro flare-ups, like Greece as an example, we just see more extreme market moves which I think would be put in the unhealthy bucket. So any perspective there would be appreciated.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I think in an effort to overly simplify this, I think healthy volatility is volatility in which client activity picks up and liquidity exists, clients feel confident. Unhealthy volatility is the reverse of that where clients get more conservative and they derisk. And so as we go through these periods, the general trend, obviously, feels like volatility is picking up in a healthy way, but that doesn't mean from time to time we're not going to hit these kind of pockets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. Got it. And then just secondly, on debt underwriting again, not to beat a dead horse, but just given the strength there, and speaking to the leverage finance market, do you feel like you're gaining market share there doing transactions that maybe others are moving away from, or does it just feel like you're benefiting with the rising tide as M&amp;A is picking up?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yeah, no, there's nothing we're doing. We're being pretty conservative in terms of our thought process in terms of the business. And our risk-taking is being very prudent. It really is all about M&amp;A activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Again, as I mentioned to you, I talked about at the announce (55:42), but when you look at the completed lead tables (55:44), obviously, our team is really in the center of all the M&amp;A dialogs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yup. Got it. Thanks, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">At this time there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. Since there are no more questions, I just want to take a moment to thank all of you for joining the call. Hopefully I and other members of senior management will see many of you in the coming months. If any additional questions arise, please feel free to reach out to Dane, otherwise enjoy the rest of your day, and I look forward to speaking with you on our third quarter call in October. Take care, everyone.

My name is Dennis, and I\u2019ll be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today, October 15, 2015. Thank you. Mr. Holmes, you may begin your conference.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Dane Holmes</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Today\u2019s call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm\u2019s belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain and outside of the firm\u2019s control. The firm\u2019s actual results and financial condition may differ possibly materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">For discussion of some of the risk and factors that could affect the firm\u2019s future results, please see the description of risk factors in our current Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, global core liquid assets, and supplementary leverage ratio. And you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that\u2019s posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com. This audiocast is copyrighted material to Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Our Chief Financial Officer, Harvey Schwartz, will now review the firm\u2019s results. Harvey?</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thanks, Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I\u2019ll walk you through the third quarter and year-to-date results, and I\u2019m happy to answer any questions. Net revenues were $6.9 billion. Net earnings $1.4 billion. Earnings per diluted share $2.90, and our annualized return on common equity was 7%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">For the year-to-date, net revenues were $26.5 billion. Net earnings $5.3 billion. Earnings per diluted share $10.84, and our return \u2013 our annualized return on common equity was 8.8%. Book value per share is up 5% relative to year-end 2014, despite recording net provisions for litigation and regulatory matters, up $2.1 billion for the year-to-date. These provisions largely from legacy issues reduced our annualized return on common equity for the first nine months of the year by approximately 3 percentage points.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Moving to the third quarter, parts of our franchise performed quite well, while others operated against a more challenging backdrop. Our M&amp;A franchise continued to deliver robust results and our outlook remains positive. We continue to see net inflows in our investment management business. Of course, they\u2019re the usual seasonal drivers due to the summer slowdown, but in addition the third quarter also had more than its fair share of significant macroeconomic developments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Both the Chinese economy and the country\u2019s monetary policy came into focus. Our clients evaluated the potential implications of a slowing Chinese economy, the decision by the People\u2019s Bank of China to devalue its currency, and the resulting volatility in global markets. As it relates to the U.S. economy, our clients remain focused on the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate policy. Over the course of the third quarter, client\u2019s expectations for an interest rate hike began to shift. Mixed economic indicators drove uncertainty about the pace of U.S. economic growth. Ultimately, there was doubt about the timing and magnitude of the future rate increase.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Another significant macroeconomic theme in the third quarter, commodities. Prices fell across a number of different products. WTI was down 24%. Copper and natural gas were both down approximately 10%. The price slump let the market to focus on the credit risk of commodity producers, trading houses, and those economies with significant commodity exports. These concerns drove an increase in credit spreads, particularly across the energy sector. The sum impact of these various events led to lower levels of client activity and a significant repricing of the equity and credit markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">The S&amp;P was down nearly 7%, the MSCI world was down almost 10%, and the Shanghai Composite was down close to 30%. In the credit markets, European high yield spreads were 107 basis points wider and U.S. high yield spreads were 153 basis points wider. Not surprisingly, we produced lower quarterly revenues across many of our businesses, given both declining asset prices and reduced level of client activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Now, I will discuss each of our businesses. Investment Banking produced third quarter revenues of $1.6 billion, 23% lower than a strong second quarter as underwriting slowed. Although issuance declined during the quarter, our Investment Banking backlog remains strong and was up compared to both the second quarter and the end of 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Breaking down the components of Investment Banking in the quarter, advisory revenues were $809 million, roughly consistent with the second quarter. Year-to-date, Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced and completed M&amp;A. During this period, we served as an advisor on nearly $900 billion of completed transactions. This is roughly $350 billion more than our next closest competitor. We advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the third quarter, including DirecTV\u2019s $67.1 billion sale to AT&amp;T, eBay\u2019s $46.8 billion spin-off of PayPal, and Baxter\u2019s $20.3 billion spin-off of Baxalta.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We also advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the third quarter. These include Energy Transfer Equity\u2019s $37.7 billion acquisition of the Williams Companies, Humana\u2019s $37 billion sale to Aetna, and Procter &amp; Gamble\u2019s $12.5 billion merger of its beauty business into Coty.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Moving to underwriting, revenues were $747 million in the third quarter, down 38% sequentially, primarily due to a significant decline in equity issuance. Although global activity was weaker, our franchise remains strong with a number one ranking in global equity and equity related and common stock offerings for the year-to-date.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Equity underwriting revenues were $190 million. This was down substantially compared to the second quarter, due to a decrease of industry wide IPOs and secondary offerings, as higher volatility and a decline in prices reduced activity. Debt underwriting revenues of $557 million were down 8% quarter-over-quarter, a decrease of industry wide issuance volumes was partially offset by acquisition related financing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">During the third quarter, we actively supported our client\u2019s financing needs leading HP Enterprises $14.6 billion debt offering related to a spin-off from HP, Biogen\u2019s $6 billion debt offering, and Simporno\u2019s [ph] $1.4 billion rights offering.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our fixed and equities businesses. Net revenues were $3.2 billion in the third quarter, down a 11% compared to the second quarter. Within the number of our businesses, the macro concerns I have already talked about impacted both client conviction and activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">FICC Client Execution net revenues were $1.5 billion in the third quarter and included a $147 million of DVA gains. Net revenues were down 9% from the second quarter and market-making conditions continue to be challenging.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Currencies improved sequentially, as the devaluation in the Chinese yuan sparked significant client activity within our emerging market franchise. Commodities increased relative to a more challenging second quarter, as declining commodity prices and higher volatility benefited results.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Interest rates was significantly lower, as uncertainty related to the direction of U.S. interest rates impacted activity. Credit decreased, as client activity remains generally low amid continued spread widening. Mortgages was significantly lower as conditions remained challenged with limited client activity. In equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees and security services, net revenues for the third quarter were $1.8 billion, down 12% quarter-over-quarter and included $35 million in DVA gains. Equities\u2019 client execution net revenues decreased 29% sequentially to $555 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Broadly speaking, client activity declined versus the second quarter, as higher volatility and global equity market weakness impacted investor conviction and risk appetite. However, as is often the case in more volatile markets, we did see activity pickup in our lower touch electronic channels, as a result commissions and fees were up 7% quarter-over-quarter to $818 million. Security services generated net revenues of $379 million, down 14%, compared to the seasonally stronger second quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to risk, despite an increase in volatility, average daily bar in the third quarter was down $3 million sequentially to $74 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Moving onto our investing and lending activities, collectively these businesses produced net revenues of $670 million in the third quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of $370 million. The declining global equity markets negatively impacted net revenues and public equities during the quarter. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $300 million with the majority coming from net interest income.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">The Investment Management reported third quarter net revenues of $1.4 billion, down 14%, excuse me, 14% from the second quarter, as incentive fees declined. Management and other fees were down 3% sequentially to $1.2 billion. Assets under supervision reached a record $1.19 trillion, as long-term net inflows more than offset market depreciation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">With respect to long-term flows, organic net inflows were strong at $23 billion. We also closed the Pacific Global Advisors acquisition during the quarter, which added $18 billion of assets. This represents our 7th acquisition since the beginning of 2012. Over that timeframe, total long-term net inflows were $195 billion. $71 billion of these net flows came from acquisitions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Moving to performance across the global platform, 72% of our client mutual fund assets were in funds ranked in the top two quartiles on a three-year basis, and 70% in funds ranked in the top two quartiles on a five-year basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Now, let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior-year equity awards and other items such as benefits was accrued at a compensation to net revenues ratio of 40% for the year-to-date. This is 200 basis points lower than the firm\u2019s accrual in the first-half of this year and consistent with the year-to-date compensation ratio at the end of the third quarter of 2014.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Third quarter non-compensation expenses were 30% lower than the second quarter. Substantially all the decrease was driven by a larger litigation charge taken in the second quarter. In the third quarter, net provisions for litigation and regulatory expenses were $416 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Now, I\u2019d like to take you through a few key statistics for the third quarter. Total staff increased by 2,000 to approximately 36,900, which was up 6% quarter-over-quarter. Roughly half of the new staff was from the federation, largely technology and operations. The other half was primarily spread across Investment Banking and Investment Management. The increase was dominated by campus hires and reflects both the activity levels in certain businesses and our continued investment in regulatory compliance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Our effective tax rate for the year-to-date was 31%. Our global core liquid assets averaged $193 billion during the quarter. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 12.4% using the Standardized approach, it was 12.7% under the Basel III Advanced approach. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 5.8%. And finally, we repurchased 5.4 million shares of common stock for $1.1 billion in the third quarter. As we have discussed related to our share repurchase capacity, any potential share repurchases over the next three quarters will be more back-end weighted compared to the last two quarters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Before we turn to Q&amp;A, I\u2019ll share some thoughts around the market and industry broadly. The third quarter served as a reminder of the fragility and sensitivity of markets, investor sentiment, and the path to strong global economic growth. As you know over the last several years, the financial services industry has faced a series of headwinds. These pressures have forced many within the industry to rethink their footprint or their level of commitment to a variety of businesses, particularly within the more capital intensive businesses of fixed income, currencies, and commodities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">At Goldman Sachs, our strategy remains intact to be the leading advisor, underwriter, liquidity provider, financier, and investment manager. To that end, we are always looking for ways to deliver more differentiated value to our clients. We\u2019re also keenly aware of the challenges facing the industry. While some of our businesses are experiencing year-to-date growth, for example, Investment Banking and Investment Management, other parts of the business are in a more difficult part of the cycle.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">However, we\u2019re hardly complacence. For example, within FICC, we are proactively responded to industry wide challenges, including asset sales, expense initiatives, and balance sheet reduction. The goal of these various efforts is to maintain margins, improve returns, prudently manage risk, and protect the global client franchise. We will always look for additional opportunities to improve our FICC operations. However, we will also never lose sight of the tremendous value that we can bring to our FICC clients over the long term.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In closing, we believe that our long-term prospects are quite favorable. Our global pipe franchise, it\u2019s as strong as ever. Our lead table rankings and track record of superior returns are a byproduct of that strength. In addition, we have the people, the risk culture, the embedded operating leverage and clarity of purpose to deliver superior value to you, our shareholders, particularly as the environment improves.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Thank you, again, for dialing in. And I\u2019m happy to answer your questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p4\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">[Operator Instructions] Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Hi. Thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Hey, good morning, Glenn.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Good morning. Harvey, Harvey, maybe we pick up where you left off on the whole cyclical versus structural debate in FICC. And I heard everything you said and I think you\u2019re right, and I think you are who you say you\u2019re for your clients. But I look at the backdrop and I say, the Europeans are actually starting to need to adjust their balance sheets and shrink parts of the business. And so the thought of Goldman maintaining is optionality all these years. This would seem like the pay off and yet a pick up in volatility in several asset classes, it feels like actually the world that was coming your way, but yet the revenue reduction for Goldman relative to peers, and I\u2019m not just talking this quarter, last couple of quarters is more pronounced. I\u2019m just trying to do the smell test of all, why is that, because I actually do think that things are lining up that you would be more important to your clients, not less and there would be more opportunities, not less.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So, well, first of all, completely agree with that thesis, maybe let\u2019s back up a little bit. And I think it\u2019s worth having a discussion, because I think the easy way to the have it is sort of break it down into three parts. Let\u2019s just talk about the quarter for a minute. Obviously, it\u2019s a tough quarter for us in fixed income. But if you think about how we\u2019re running the business, I think that\u2019s the more important two parts.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">If you look back over the last several years at the expense initiatives we\u2019ve taken where we have reduced headcount fixed income by more than 10%. We have shrunk the balance sheet by 20%, and if you actually look at it on RWA basis since we switched over to Basel III, we really very softly [ph] managed the capital deployment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So in this part of the cycle, we have been very disciplined about how we managed those resources. Now, of course, your thesis is our thesis, which is we\u2019re in a deep and somewhat long cyclical part of the fixed cycle. But when you think of the forward, our construction simplified is twofold. Our level engagement with our clients tells us clients still need the services. It\u2019s like M&amp;A, Glenn.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">M&amp;A, the services weren\u2019t active in 2009 and 2010, people questioned whether or not M&amp;A would come back. But our dialogue told us that client engagement and the services we provided to the liquidity provider were important. So when we think about the forward and we hear the announcements and we\u2019re in this part of the cycle, but it\u2019s going to take a while for that to transition through, because I think so far it\u2019s been more than announcements than a retrenchment, and you won\u2019t really see it happen in all the steps we\u2019ve taken until you see a pick up in client activity and the competitive environment continue to shift, that may take a while.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">But in the meantime, look, we\u2019ll benefit as a firm, because we would diversify until you saw a pick up in certain part of equities, you\u2019ve seen the strength in banking. But certainly a tougher quarter for us in fixed income this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">May just a last follow-up on the FICC conversation is, how if any, does the new vocal reporting requirements changed? How you managed the business? How you reported? I\u2019m just curious, because we can\u2019t see any of them?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">No chance that we managed the business. Any steps in terms of vocal adoption happened a number of years ago, where we shutdown certain business. And all of the U.S. firms are subject to the same rule set in vocal, so not an issue. I really think it\u2019s a question of client environment. In the third quarter, the environment for all the factors I mentioned was very challenging, it was hard for us. And if we go back to the first quarter the first quarter environment was one with more activity and better performance on our part, but we don\u2019t want to overreact to a particular quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay, I appreciate that. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Thanks, Glenn.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Thanks, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Hi, Michael.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Hi. Just first, you mentioned some of your comments on the commodity, I guess pressures in the quarter. Just wanted to get kind of an update. When you guys look at commodities and that everyone call it asset class. Just how do you view your exposure to that part of the market or the economy? And then, when you look at it from a client base, what has been happening, meaning our \u2013 the clients in those areas lot \u2013 less active, more active, and are you seeing that spread to any other areas of the economy?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So in terms of the exposure, we\u2019re not a big lender to the energy space. I think the best way to characterize it for you is just to take a look at two parts of that. First, any of our funded exposure to non-investment grade parts of the sector, it\u2019s a bit over $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion. And the other sector, which obviously came to focus in the quarter is the trading houses. And we\u2019re less than $200 million in exposure to those trading houses. So they\u2019re not, as I said, we\u2019re not a big lender, not an important part of our business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">In terms of the aggregate impact, in terms of client activity, things have been moving so quickly that sometimes as advantageous to client activity and intensity when things are more trending. I think the whole world is adjusting to basically a longer-term consideration of commodity prices being lower in the intermediate term. And ultimately, that will be a catalyst for activity, as clients considered hedging strategies, as they think about financing alternatives, as clients and companies struggle for refinancing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So lower for longer in commodity prices, while very good for the consumer and the global consumer and the broader economy, which is also a tailwind, certainly, it should be a catalyst for client activity also.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay, thanks. And then just as a follow-up, maybe on capital and the ratios, if you have the CET1, maybe like the fully phased immerse of the transitional, and then just given the decent buffers, just any outlook in terms of where you think you would run that? In the buyback pace, just seemed like it ramped up. I know you guys have been saying, it\u2019s backward weighted, but it just seemed like this quarter was probably a bit sooner than expected. So just wanted to understand, is that because of the movement in the stock or is it just the plan with the CCAR process being pretty normal from what you guys expected?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Yes. So on the capital ratio, so with the G-SIB buffer finalized that what you said 10%, and obviously we have a lot of capacity above that. Our target zone would be 50 to 100 basis points above that. If you\u2019re just looking at that set of metrics and obviously our supplementary leverage ratios in very good shape at 58, but CCARs are binding constraints. And so, at least, it has been.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">In terms of the share repurchase capacity and what we\u2019ll do, obviously as you know, we don\u2019t disclose that, we don\u2019t disclose it for the very simple fact that we don\u2019t want our shareholders to think of share repurchase as dividends. And we also reserve and really look forward to actually deploying the capital back into the business. Now, in terms of the mechanics of what is possible part of the profile that you saw over the last two quarters certainly dictated by the specifics of the test. But to an extent, which we use the capacity over the next three quarters, as I said in my early remarks, you should expect it to be more back-end weighted than you\u2019ve seen in the prior two. Does that helpful?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. And \u2013 yes. And then just to see if you want, if you had the fully phased in, and I think you guys gave the transitional?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So on Standardized or are you talking Advanced?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">I think if you have both, but Advanced probably more\u2026</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">[indiscernible] began. So on a transitional advanced 12.7%, fully phased in 11.9%, on Standardized 12.4%, and fully phased 11.7%. So as I said a lot of capacity over our 10% minimum and our operating range of 10.5% to a 11%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Got it. Thanks a lot.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay<strong>.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Your next question is from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Hey, Chris, good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Mr. Christian, check your phone to see if your line is on mute, sir?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Hello, good morning. Can you hear me now?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Yes, sure.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Yes, sorry by that. I will ask the FICC question of another way, as it\u2019s a focus of investor this morning. I guess, three of the last four quarters, performances lagged peers. How do you rationalize this? Is it a business mix or customer mix issue? And then looking forward just a bear market backdrop, or is there any proactive steps you can take to improve performance?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Well, there\u2019s always things we can do better, we\u2019re not perfect. So we always look at them. Christian, we don\u2019t see as much value in comparing revenues certainly revenues quarter-to-quarter movements, but we certainly study them and we look for any valuable insights. But I think if you really look to the quarter-to-quarter noise, you run the risk of over steering the business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So, for example, in the first quarter, we didn\u2019t glean huge value out of that in terms of comparing competitors, I don\u2019t know how much value we\u2019ll get out of this quarter. So we don\u2019t have a lot of visibility into their businesses. Our focus has to be on a hand of things, most importantly, our client engagements, and then our profit margins, the risk management, and the ultimate returns. And so that\u2019s really what we\u2019ll focus on. In fact, now it\u2019s interesting, because you brought up the issue of volatility of revenues, and I make a couple of important points.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">If you look over the years, revenues don\u2019t really tell a great story. And as a shareholder, if you want a collection of businesses, and if you actually look at our performance, consistency of ROE, and returns and earnings, we\u2019re the most stable. And so it really is about from wide earnings, not revenues. Anyway I don\u2019t know if that helps you or not.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Yes, no, that helps, and thanks for the clarifications. Maybe just a broader question on pricing power in the business. I guess, what lessons have you learned from the price increases implemented in the prime brokerage business from what we can see revenue generation has not suffered at all for any of the top players. Maybe does that tell you that the industry has more leverage in pricing, and maybe can we expect this and other business to maybe offset some of the weaker activity trends?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So I think there\u2019s two things driving. Your first is a question of really strength of franchise. And we\u2019ve had a long, long history of being a dominant player in the prime brokerage business, and I think it really is the value proposition that we offer our clients globally, that is the differential in that business. I think the capital rules, as they come into play and the balance sheet impact of those capital rules in the class has forced a very natural repricing in terms of how much balance sheet we and the industry can provide the clients. And clients are being very judicious about that, but they\u2019re also been making a differentiated judgment about who the best value providers are, and we\u2019re certainly one of those. And so we\u2019re seeing pricing power.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And any other businesses you think you can accept that pricing power?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So, certainly in as we talked about in the past from time-to-time when activity has picked up, I don\u2019t know necessarily, I would call it pricing power as much as I would call it an absence of competition. But certainly in the commodity space several quarters ago, there was a lot of activity where certainly competition, which if you want to call that pricing power, I think of it a little bit differently. But certainly clients were going to engage us differently. And then in the derivative businesses globally, as you\u2019re seeing firms exit parts of the CDS business and other parts of the equity derivative businesses, I think it\u2019s early days, but certainly you\u2019re seeing a reduction in competition, and that translates into pricing power or maybe better said better returns.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thanks, Christian.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question is from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hey, Matt.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O\u2019Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Actually first is the quick follow-up to that very last comment you made about some repricing in parts of equity derivatives. I just I haven\u2019t heard that before. Maybe I haven\u2019t been paying attention. But what areas there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So it\u2019s really two parts we\u2019ve seen some of it in Europe where competition used to be sort of more significant, but also given the requirements around collateral worlds and things like that where you may have at times had marginal participants actually pricing that levels where we would have thought the risk return didn\u2019t make sense. Now you\u2019re seeing more rational and improved pricing I\u2019d say that\u2019s a general trend.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O\u2019Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. And then just separately, can you give us an update on the bank deposit and lending strategy. You obviously announced a deal to acquire some deposits and have had a key hire in the lending side I think in the second quarter. So just give us an update on what you are thinking there and will we see this business grow to be meaningful at some point?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Sure, great question. And the way the first thing I will emphasize on that question is really the separation between a liability strategy, and potential asset strategy. So these two things are completely separate, but I think it\u2019s natural that people would link them.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">The online deposit strategy, where we requested approval for the deposit platform that really is all about funding diversification we have spent sometime contemplating building our own platform this platform became available, it seemed attractive and timely for us and for GE. And so, but we would do that independently of any asset driven strategy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Now, in terms of the digitally led lending strategy, which you talked about is not a lot to update you on since we last talked. We\u2019re thrilled to have Harvey on board as our partner, he brings a wealth of knowledge and we feel like there is a handful of reasons why we maybe able to have an impact on this space here.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">One our real core competencies, and risk management, and technology. And we feel like we maybe able to provide a differentiated product that is accretive to the firms current returns, but it\u2019s going to be slow going obviously, we built lots of business at Goldman Sachs this is a new business. Again it\u2019s great to have Harvey here, because he brings all the expertise\u2019s and when we have more to talk you about we\u2019ll certainly update you, but it\u2019s going to be very deliberate in terms of its development.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O\u2019Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And I guess just a quick follow-up, on the funding side, as we think about the deposits growing over time, is that something that will benefit you in down turns or is it also something that will benefit the earnings incrementally from lower funding costs?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I think it\u2019s too twofold I mean, we have always been very conservative about our liquidity profile and a part of being conservative is about being diversified and so we\u2019re always looking for diversification I\u2019m always looking for cost-effectiveness. But when we think about liability management, again it it\u2019s really about making sure we have the strongest financial footings at any given point of time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O\u2019Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay, thanks for taking my questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Hi, good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Hey, Betsy, how are you?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Good. So, just a question about how you think about your market share. As you indicated, revenues were tough way to measure things, because people have different positions and marks, et cetera. So, I\u2019m interested in understanding how you think about how you are doing on market share, really from a transaction side. I know you talk about client engagement. So thinking that from a transaction perspective ignoring the P&amp;L impact where do you think you stand in your various businesses?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So, I know you\u2019re asking me question narrowly, but in terms of running those businesses and particularly FICC, it really is multipart. So our client engagements in the businesses that we\u2019re focused on feels quite good. So for example we\u2019re not the biggest emerging markets firm as you know, because we don\u2019t have offices in hundred countries and it\u2019s never been the biggest part of our footprint there are certainly always things that we\u2019re focused on and if you think about our client base, we\u2019re more skewed I think, because we\u2019re not the biggest lender in the globe, we\u2019re more skewed to professional money managers and investors and you saw and you could see their activity moves around.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">But we feel good about our client engagements and our market shares, but it\u2019s a multi-part question is \u2013 it\u2019s not just about clients although they\u2019re the most important part and running these businesses, it really is about margins returns over the long-term.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay then separately on the INL space last quarter you gave a very helpful dissection of a third, a third, a third in terms of revenue flows that were a function of public marks versus not so public versus private. Do you have any kind of breakdown on how the quarter was impacted by that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Sure, so let\u2019s just maybe step back. So at the end of the second quarter the INL balance sheet was $89 billion and roughly 75% of that is debt related. So the balance really equity related and then it breaks out.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">But the breakout I gave you last time really was public equities, which were down and they [part 11 1: 41]more or less in line with global markets and they started $4 billion at the quarter and so certainly there was just the path to mark-to-market.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And then in private equity the vast majority of the performance that offset the public portfolio was event related and by event related I mean sales, pending sales IPOs. And we really benefited from the idiosyncratic nature of the portfolio. We\u2019re not large for example in some of the hardest hit sectors like energy and that kind of stuff.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. Thanks, very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question is from a line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Hi.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Hi Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Questions on trading both equities, and fixed income. What percent is electronic or automated and has that compared to five years ago. And then the second question is, kind of what percent of the business would you say pricing is more rational than it\u2019s been in the past?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So, on the second part I\u2019d say it\u2019s the trend is improving in terms of rational pricing, but it\u2019s in a market where the client engagement from quarter-to-quarter has been very different right, so we saw it in the first quarter, we saw less in second quarter I think that I would answer the electronic trading question as sort of long-term.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">The secular trend, which has been in place long before the crisis, that just continues and to some extent is aided by the creation of SEPs and things. This quarter what we\u2019ve seen in the past, what we saw in this quarter where when volatility is quite severe particularly in the equity markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Clients really look to de-risk or add risk and they tend to trade electronically, so I would say it\u2019s a trend, but I don\u2019t have the specific numbers for you Mike, in terms of the quarter contribution of electronic versus cash, but we can certainly get to that stuff.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I think, can you just give even a ballpark. If electronic 5%, 10%, 20%, 50% just any sort of ballpark figure?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Well, I don\u2019t want to guess on a ballpark, certainly in the third quarter there was a meaningful pick up in electronic activity relative to cash in the equities business and again I don\u2019t want to guess at a number for you Mike, we\u2019ll be happy to get you one.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Sure, and then just a follow-up on the pricing. What areas in particular are you seeing the best pricing improvement in trading?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So, I\u2019d say balance sheet intensive business is broadly and that really is as firms globally around the world adjust capital requirements and have to be more thoughtful about the marginal deployment of balance sheet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And then other things, that are potentially balance sheet consumers like longer dated derivatives swaps and certainly when commodities has picked up, we have seen circumstances where and this is obviously augmented by the fact that their trading houses have gone through some pretty significant pressure now. What we\u2019re saying reduce competition, but again it\u2019s harder to see it certainly translate through unless the client activity levels are high. I think that\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing this big back and forth swing between a quarter like the first quarter where we had a 14.7% ROE and in this quarter we have a much tougher quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">All right. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Thanks, Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I just wanted to follow-up a little bit first on the composition of the change in revenues in equities and FICC from the second to the third quarter in FICC you alluded I think to rates first off as having contributed significantly, and then you mentioned credit and mortgages, was that kind of the ordering of the degree to, which they impacted the revenue move?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Mortgages, was a bigger driver if you\u2019re doing year-over-year comparables.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Right. But I mean for the second quarter to third quarter shift?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Mortgages remain challenged. The biggest driver was interest rates and then followed by mortgages.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. So the widening of credit spreads that was actually pretty significant in the quarter didn\u2019t really \u2013 it wasn\u2019t as impactful overall on FICC as just what was going on in rates and mortgages?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes, we saw it more in those two businesses, but it was still challenging obviously for credit markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And then really to the same question for equity, you\u2019ve talked in the release on a year-over-year basis about cash versus derivatives. But can you talk about, as you move from second to third quarter, what was driving the change in client execution?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So, it\u2019s pretty straightforward. Obviously, lots of volatility in Asia, which had an impact on the entire market structure in terms of global market responded. But basically there instead of the shift I talked about earlier, tougher market conditions in Asia and then a shift to electronic activity, which boosted commissions and fees.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Got it. And then just final question, which I think is going to relate to I&amp;L, in the release you alluded to a pretty hefty decline in level III assets linked quarter about 15%. Is that largely driven by I&amp;L, and if so, can you give us a sense for how much of the reduction is due to actual runoff for planned portfolio sales versus just the impact of negative marks?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">A pretty meaningful driver was actually monetizations and harvesting that was really the driver.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So, actually underlying the negative mark-to-market on the public portfolio. It really does sound like there was very significant positive activity in terms of just being able to reduce positions?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes, I don\u2019t \u2013 in terms of reduced positions, you mean, in terms of harvesting\u2026</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes, monetization let\u2019s put it that way?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes, the portfolio did well. As I said, the vast majority of the driver of the performance in the portfolio came from event driven things like IPOs, asset sales. Obviously, the public portfolio suffered with public markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And in terms of \u2013 just a follow-up on exactly that comment, would it be as straightforward as to saying the public portfolio was $4 billion in equities, the MSCI as you\u2019ve alluded to was down about 10% that the mark there would be about that, or is it more complex to that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">It can be different from quarter-to-quarter, but I would say that\u2019s pretty reasonable.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. Thanks, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thanks so much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question is from the line of Fiona Swaffield with RBC. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Hey, Fiona.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Fiona Swaffield</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Just \u2013 hi. Just few things. One is the difference between the CT1 ratios and obviously the difference in Advanced and Standardized has gone down quite a lot. And it seems to be something to do, I just wondered, is it the operational risk RWA, I don\u2019t know if you could talk through the differences in those numbers?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And the second is just a geographic question. I mean, you\u2019ve alluded to Asia a few times, but could you kind of give us a feel for year-on-year geographic revenues, or kind of trends EMEA versus Asia, were those any big change versus on Q2? Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes. So in terms of the ratios in Advanced and there was a pick up in operational, which impacted and there was a pickup in operational, which impacted the operational, but the real driver in the improvement of the ratios was on harvesting, in general risk reduction and you\u2019re seeing it more in standardized, because obviously there are things that are not eccentric, which impact that more like things like clearing and other things and notional and so that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing the compression. In terms of geography, it has been pretty much 55% in the U.S. and then the balance is really two-thirds EMEA and one-third Asia.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Fiona Swaffield</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Like what time period would that be is that Q3?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">No that\u2019s this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Fiona Swaffield</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Great. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Hey. Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Hey, good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Just a question on the M&amp;A outlook. I think there\u2019s been some concern with the disruptions in the market in U.S. hitting the record level that the M&amp;A cycle might be peaking. I just wanted to get your thoughts on that. It seems like number of deals haven\u2019t really moved. International volume still remained very well. So I just maybe some thoughts on how you guys think about where we are in the M&amp;A cycle given some of the concerns out there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So, the two factors that, obviously we rely on most is the backlog, and the pipeline is good. And as I said it was up at the end of the third quarter and then really the most significant information component for us is the level of dialogue that board\u2019s CEOs are having and the dialogue feels quite good. I think it\u2019s always natural for folks to question when the market has been robust, whether there is information content in the actual activity level as peaking and maybe that\u2019s a factor.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">But when you look at past cycles they\u2019ve been more significantly driven by LBO activity where certainly you can get some market capacity and how much debt can be borrowed and it\u2019s a 100% accurate to note that certainly the cost of financing is a contributor to the transactions that are happening today, but they\u2019re much more strategic and a reflection of slower global growth and how confident CEOs are at this stage. And that could always get disrupted, you can have a market event, but I don\u2019t know necessarily that the aggregate activity levels to-date are the best indicators that they would slow down. If anything, some of these large transactions very naturally have spin-offs and foster other activity across industries. That wouldn\u2019t be the most significant factor we\u2019d look at.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So, you would kind of think is the large deals as this maybe potentially a leading indicator, because a lot of these smaller deals and the number of deals have been lagging.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">That\u2019s correct, but so if you get large deals in a sector, it can have a knock on effect and you get spin-offs that can be a leading activity for more activity, but I think in short our indicators tell us that if the current environment continues the level of activity will be high. Again that could always change, a lot of things in the world can shift.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Sure. Okay and maybe just a follow-up on the balance sheet. I think if I look at your disclosures you guys balance sheet was up to a level we haven\u2019t seen in a I think over a year I think balance sheet was up 20 billion plus quarter-over-quarter yet it was a volatile environment, it just looked like you pulled back on risk at least in the bar, can you kind of just help me think through that, you didn\u2019t close on the deposit franchise acquisition this quarter \u2013 third quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">No, that\u2019s subject to regulatory approval.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Great.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">No, the balance sheet growth, when you cut through it is really all driven by prime brokers\u2019 activity and so is all client driven in terms of client assets that came in during the course of the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Just sort of interesting, putting on leverage or?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">No actually, you get somebody to fix when people de-lever, actually you can get cash that comes in and actually comes into the balance sheet so client assets can grow partial driver.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. Thanks a lot.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">No problem.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question is from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christoph Kotowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes, hi your comp ratio on a full-year basis have been trending down ever so slightly last couple of years and you were able to keep the year-to-date comp ratio flat at 40% with revenues being down a percent. Going into the fourth quarter how should we think about the full-year comp ratio in terms of that there\u2019d be upward pressure on it if the full-year revenues miss a bit more from here or continued downward pressure the fourth quarter ends up being better and driving you above where you were last year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So, no change to the compensation philosophy the 40% at this point a year is our best estimate. And we\u2019ll have to see I can\u2019t predict the outcome for you in terms of where the Roland obviously we\u2019ve spent in number of years really building in pretty significant operating leverage, but we\u2019ll have to see how the year plays out, but we\u2019ll go through our normal bottoms up top down process.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christoph Kotowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay, all right. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Morning, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">The you made a point in the press release about the IB backlog building and just was kind of curious whether or not in your view that\u2019s a function improving business outlook or just deals getting held up due to market volatility in some of the trends that we saw impact the FB underwriting line?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yes, so all parts of the backlog were up. The biggest part of the backlog, that was up with equity underwriting. And part of that is the markets being more challenges, and challenge in part of the season, but I think that the more important takeaway is less about market influence over the quarter and more about activity levels client confidence, which certainly at times for CEOs would have been tested as we came during the quarter. But the transactions that they\u2019re contemplating are very long-term and strategic. And so I think it speaks more to corporate confidence than anything else.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay, but thanks for that color. And then thinking about that point and then connecting it to I&amp;L and the commentary around monetization events and such. Can you help us understand how, when, the exit strategy or ability to use the IPOs or equity markets is weaker how you guys were able to have an up-tick in monetization and episodic events in I&amp;L I was just trying to connect those two dots please.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So, again it\u2019s just it\u2019s the nature of the portfolio, it won\u2019t always necessarily be this way in the quarter, but there will be opportunities for us to sell assets and in taking company\u2019s public and those kind of things those were usually on a schedule, it usually don\u2019t happen instantaneously they can certainly get delayed by market activity. But I can\u2019t answer the question any better for you than it\u2019s the nature of the portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay and I mean did you rely on M&amp;A in addition to IPO, it sounds like you were purely relying going on the IPOs market right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">There\u2019s IPOs, private sale they can come in a number of different forms, so there\u2019s certainly transaction that you wouldn\u2019t see the public eye parts of the portfolio are in real estate not really heavy and financials or anything like that not heavy in energy. So that gives you some of the background why maybe the portfolio on it\u2019s surface would have performed better than you might have expected.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Great, thanks for the color Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Hi good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Good morning Steven.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Harvey, I appreciated all your comments on the quarter FICC strategy how are you still committed to business at the same time aren\u2019t going to be complacent. And just looking at some of the capital metrics, it feels as though the RWAs have been slight to maybe honest slightly downward trajectory, but we haven\u2019t seen any meaningful change in terms capital and risk allocations.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And just want to get a sense as to and trying and obviously making a concerted effort not to simply be complacent whether you\u2019re going to look to shrink risk on and any meaningful way within that business if the pressures persists on the revenue side?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So, the risk reduction again well level said it since we want obviously the risk reduction is pretty significant right RWAs were down a third across ICS, which is vastly, which is mostly FICC and so I think the risk reduction effort, the balance sheet reduction, the cost reduction exercises have been pretty significant.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So I don\u2019t think we can be accused of being complacent around the cycle again this is about finding that right balance. If the cycle continues and it stops we\u2019ll continue to evaluate the business that is an ongoing process that never stops. If the cycle picks up then, we will obviously participate and that we can feel good about the competitive environment and our client engagement. Now away from fixed, obviously, we\u2019re doing lots of other things. So, I talked about the fact that we made a number of acquisitions in asset management and that fee-based business continues to grow and be a bigger part of the firm. Obviously, full engagement in IBD and or the merger activity and their performance I think has been stellar.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So there\u2019s a lot going on under the hood in terms of reallocating resources. But we are being very disciplined about the fixed business during this part of the cycle, as you would expect us to be.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay, thanks for that, Harvey. And it\u2019s a fair point on the RWA, as I was talking more in the near-term context over the last few quarters. But certainly, since we\u2019ve been monitoring all the Basel III measures, you made a pretty substantial progress?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">That I also think, look, I think if you look at our capital management and the capital we\u2019ve been able to return over the last several years, we\u2019ve been as judicious as we can given the capital rules, and managing the firm in a way to make sure that the financial footings are perfectly solid.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. And then as you mentioned the capital rules, there is one quick follow-up. Did you say buffers have all been published by the Fed, it looks like you guys fell into the 3% bucket. I just wanted to get a sense as to whether you see any opportunities to optimize or shrink into that lower buffer 2.5 or given that CCARs are binding constraint, at least, for the moment as maybe not such a pressing need to do that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So, well, I think the big picture, the first thing we\u2019ll do obviously is in any opportunity that we think we can reduce our systemic footprint now that the rule is finalized. Obviously, we would look to do that. I think that\u2019s just good practice. I think the trade-off obviously is whether or not in making those reductions, does that really impact your ability to deliver to clients. Now the rules are finalized. There are certainly things we can do.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">As you said, we\u2019re not bound currently by our state of capital ratios, CCARs are are constrained, we\u2019ll have to see how CCAR evolves over time, that certainly could be an influence, because it could ultimately reprice the cost of that capital relative to the services we provide. But I think it\u2019s a bit early for that, at least, for us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">All right. Thanks for taking my questions, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question is from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Hi, how are you? Just to follow up on the I&amp;L discussion. Can you give us a sense of how we should think about sort of the quarter-to-quarter risk management practices within that unit, given how market volatility can have such a profound effect on revenue recognition in any given period?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Well, again, I think, one of the \u2013 I think one of the things to point out is, if you think about the transformation of the I&amp;L balance sheet over the last several years, it has changed pretty significantly. The composition today, as I said earlier is really 75% debt. And roughly two-thirds of that is HFI accounting, which is just good old-fashioned bank accounting. The balance is equities and if you compare that to, for example, go back to 2011, in 2011, I think the whole portfolio was more than 50% equities. And so the composition of the portfolio has changed significantly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Now, if you\u2019re going to have $4 billion public equity portfolio, which is the result of us monetizing asset out of the portfolio and we\u2019re in a sell-down process, if the markets move around a lot that\u2019s going to move around a lot. And ultimately, if the markets decline for extended periods of time or increase for extended periods, obviously that drives value of underlying assets and it drives activity for all businesses in all industries. But the portfolio composition has changed pretty dramatically over the last several years. And when you talk about the volatility, I can\u2019t help to remind you that over long periods of time, I&amp;L has been a pretty big driver of book value.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">No, certainly, I mean, I guess, my \u2013 I\u2019m trying to make sure I sort of fully understand, given that so much of the, at least, equity opportunity does come from seed investments sort of then hit their liquidation strategy, sort of how that shifts the risk management discussion when you move from no liquid to an \u2013 to a liquid asset, whose risk parameters are somewhat different?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yes. So we obviously consider that I think the most important risk component in the discussion is about the point of actually establishing the investments and that\u2019s a long-term process of being disciplined that has to be the philosophy, so look if we see a number of quarters of back to back declining in market that may be the right time to actually being to put capital to work which is why we run with excess capital and we run with excess liquidity because we want to be there for those opportunities and we want to be there for our client. So we size the risk of the investment at the point of making it. Once you have it you can certainly do things but prudent risk management really is the point of the initial decision.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Got it and that makes a lot of sense and if I can just sneak in one quick follow up on the RWA discussion within the trading businesses. Was there any real change in RWA over the course of the quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">There were I mean in advance, we finished the quarter at 570 that was down a little bit. In standardized we finished at 582 which you would expect to be down given the move I gave you in the ratios earlier.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And presumably most out of FICC or someone else?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Sorry, what was that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And I was just saying was that mostly because of changes in FICC composition or something else?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">The big mover was really in markets which in advanced went from 13.6% to kind of 11.9% and Standardized went from 13.7% down to 12.0% and that really is about derisking.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Great. Thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question is from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marlin Lacey Mosby IV</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thanks. Good morning Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Good morning Marty.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marlin Lacey Mosby IV</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I wanted to give you a chance to stop the drum beat that we have had on levelling out the comp ratio through the year when you mentioned earlier that some consistency of returns for the whole company and not the volatility of revenues. So, just wanted to see whether or not you think coincidentally, the way that this line is up as you go through the calendar year, revenues are typically stronger in the first half, and you get the comp ratio benefit in the second half and somehow coincidentally that kind of hedges each other. I just wanted to get your thoughts on that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So we don\u2019t do it that way as other way that we think about it. There\u2019s some seasonality to the business which historically has been the case for the entire industry. As it relates to the compensation ratio from quarter-to-quarter, we just make our best estimates of where we think the performance of the firm is and what the compensation ratio should be. In the fourth quarter we will go through our normal process which again will be firm performance rather than to the businesses and to the individuals and it would top down to bottoms up and we will just have to see where things turn out for the fourth quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marlin Lacey Mosby IV</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So that\u2019s why I was mentioning coincidentally. I know you don\u2019t tie them together like that but it kind of works out in the favour of, kind of stabilizing as you go through the year. The second thing I was going to ask you was you mentioned the acquisitions in the asset managers and what we used to do is look at certain businesses where you could really leverage your economic capital while not really impacting your regulatory capital and I thought this is probably a business that might fit into that category and just thought is that kind of how you look at it and also there are other businesses you might be able to take advantage of that in?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So we\u2019re always looking really at the quarter. We are always looking at ways where we can enhance the client experience and so you know all these acquisitions which I mentioned, they really break down to three large buckets, secular growth opportunities like advisory and in that it was referenced in the \u2013 as I said in the Pacific Global Advisors\u2019 acquisition, and those things like new product capabilities where we certainly develop new products internally, but there are times both in demand is better for us and that\u2019s an example, that would be Westpeak and ActiveBeta and then there are times when we just want to scale existing products like money markets and you have seen us do acquisitions in that space. It really is all about \u2013 thing about how we can differentiate with our clients. Now from a regulatory capital perspective, we don\u2019t necessarily think about that as much as we think about what is the best way to deploy our capital. Obviously we have to manage our regulatory capital but this is a result of regulatory requirements or anything like that. We will always look at acquisitions or ways to grow or deploy our capital that are long-term accretive for the firm. We want to just to grow obviously those that consume more regulatory capital and those that consume less.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marlin Lacey Mosby IV</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And those that will have a little less or little more efficient and use of the capital that you have, but thanks and I appreciate your comments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay. Thanks. So I just had a quick question on the deposits strategy. You mentioned that was all about the funding diversification. So if you look at the second quarter deposits were about 12% of total liabilities. What percentage that you need to get to for you to consider that to be you\u2019ve to meet your diversification levels as you want?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So it\u2019s not so much that we are targeting a specific level. We cannot \u2013 not to target specific levels around things like that, because it is much about the asset footing as it\u2019s about liabilities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">In our liability structure, we just like that having a diversified geographic client base, source of liabilities, we just think that\u2019s prudent risk management. When you think about it, it\u2019s all really about where various investors want to provide capital to the firm and so that\u2019s how we think about it. So we haven\u2019t set a target. The reason we don\u2019t set targets and things like that is we always are concerned about building up too much of a warehouse of liquidity, we obviously hold a very significant liquidity cushion at $193 billion. Like you don\u2019t want to feel yourself getting pressed into deploying those liabilities, you don\u2019t want the liabilities to drive your asset strategy, you want your liabilities to inform it and you want to have diversified safe funding.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Do you anticipate that there will be some benefit on interest expense over time as you might take off maybe short-term borrowings?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">It could be over time I don\u2019t think in terms of the online deposit I don\u2019t see a huge cost advantage there. Again it\u2019s all maybe about how can we deploy that funding into the asset opportunities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay great there was no other question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Your next question is from the line of Kian Abouhossein with JPMorgan Chase. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kian Abouhossein</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Yes, hi. First question relates to commodities, you mentioned, so you talked about the lending exposure, but frankly I\u2019m not really interested in that I\u2019m more interested how you manage your counterparty exposure.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And if you can talk a little bit about how you think about these trading entities that you deal with, how you are managing counterparty exposure considering rating downgrades that we have seen, but also concerns about some of these entities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And if you can just run us little bit through how you manage counterparty risk on your off balance sheet exposure?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yes. Hi Kian. I\u2019m sorry you must\u2019ve missed it what I was saying before was our exposure whether it\u2019s lending or through any derivatives or counterparty exposure to the trading entities is less than $200 million today.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kian Abouhossein</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">So that\u2019s your net exposure off balance sheet and on balance sheet?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yes correct that\u2019s for the trading out. Again they often intend to position us as more as competitors than clients.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kian Abouhossein</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">So that\u2019s our current credit exposure.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kian Abouhossein</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And just in that context clearly you must adjust to rating downgrades as well as your own view around some of the counterparties, the margins or collateral calls etcetera. Can you just explain a little bit to us how you do that? You said the adjustment happening beside the credit ratings, which will drive it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">We have a long history obviously managing counterparty exposure, which has been tested through pretty volatile markets and again the most important decision made at any point in time is when you establish that credit line it\u2019s really no different than lending, but obviously the dynamics are different.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And we have a very diligent marking policy and we monitor collateral calls very vigilantly as you would imagine. And obviously as sectors are weaker you\u2019re very thoughtful about it, but when we make these decisions over long-term we have lot of experience doing it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kian Abouhossein</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay and in respect just coming back to your fixed-income business the way I at least to myself explain the weakness and please correct me if I\u2019m incorrect is the fact that you are weak on macro and weaker in corporate so just probably correlate it and you\u2019re strong in credit and hedge fund business. And first of all is that an incorrect assumption relative to your peers, I mean, especially some of your money centered peers?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And secondly, if I\u2019m correct, what are you doing? Do you think about diversifying more as a business into and particular as a macro business? And what are you doing to adjust that mix?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">So, again, I don\u2019t have great visibility into the competitors. I would say, I do think there are two obvious things which I talked about before. We\u2019re not at big in emerging markets, again, we don\u2019t have a footprint in hundreds of offices and we\u2019re not a big lender to corporate. Our competitors are much greater lenders than we are. And so that certainly can influence your client base.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">In terms of macro, I think, you are wrong about that. And certainly, in commodities, we\u2019ve had a long history being commodities and it feels now like we\u2019re bigger in commodities as the number competitors have pulled away from the business. That \u2013 those are the effects I would give you in terms of what I can say.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">In terms of things we\u2019re trying to do, we feel pretty good about the diversified business. I mean, if you think about the course of the year to be sitting here basically nearly flat revenues with our fee-based business is picking up activity, which is compensating for our capital intensive parts of the firm, which you would expect to be more challenged in this kind of market environments. If you look at end of the day when you adjust for legacy costs, we\u2019re nearly a 12% ROE. I know the business grows pretty diversified.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kian Abouhossein</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">So you don\u2019t this argument valid off of the nimble credit geared to rather than macro in certain periods of the environment, depending on the environment we will just perform slightly differently from some of our peers, you don\u2019t see that against your money-centered peers?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I think a lot of the peers have different footings, some are more domestic, some are more emerging-market base, I think the comparables are harder. Again look, take a look at the first quarter. In the first quarter, the way you look at it, we would have outperformed all the peers, that\u2019s information for us. But we\u2019re not going to steer the business in a different direction, because of that we\u2019re not going to over steer it [Technical Difficulty] their revenues on the surface would greater than ours. We\u2019re always going to look ways to improve the business. So that you should just incorporate by reference.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kian Abouhossein</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Okay, very helpful. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Thanks, Kian.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">At this time there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Since there are no more questions, I\u2019d like to take a moment to thank all of you for joining this call. Hopefully, I and other members of the senior management will see many of you in the coming months. If any additional questions arise, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to Dane, otherwise enjoy the rest of your day, and look forward to speaking with you on our fourth quarter earnings call in January. Take care, everyone.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs third quarter 2015 earnings conference call.

My name is Dennis, and I'll be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs' Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today, January 20, 2016.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you. Mr. Holmes, you may begin your conference.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Dane Holmes</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. Today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the Firm's belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain and outside of the Firm's control. The Firm's actual results and financial condition may differ possibly materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">For discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the Firm's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our current Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 2014. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, global core liquid assets, and supplementary leverage ratio. And you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that's posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">This audiocast is copyrighted material of the Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent. Our Chief Financial Officer, Harvey Schwartz, will now review the firm's results. Harvey?</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thanks, Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I'll walk you through the fourth quarter and full year results and I'm happy to answer any questions. Before outlining our results, I would like to discuss the previously announced settlement for legacy mortgage activities. As you know we took a total net provision for litigation and regulatory matters in the fourth quarter of $1.95 billion. The RMBS Working Group matter, was the most significant outstanding piece of litigation facing the firm. As you would expect, following a settlement, there has been a significant decline in our recently possible loss number. We are currently estimating a more than 60% decline compared to third quarter levels of $5.3 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Now turning to the fourth quarter, net revenues were $7.3 billion. Net earnings were $765 million and earnings per diluted share were $1.27. With respect to our annual results, we had Firm wide net revenues of $33.8 billion, net earnings of $6.1 billion, earnings per diluted share of $12.14 and a return on common equity of 7.4%. Revenues were down slightly compared with last year and expenses were significantly higher due to approximately $4 billion of net provisions for litigation and regulatory matters. Despite these headwinds, we grew book value per share by 5%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">The growth combined with our risk reduction efforts, strengthened all of our regulatory capital ratios. Excluding the litigation charges related to the RMBS Working Group, our 2015 return on common equity would've been 380 basis points higher.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">2015 presented both challenges and opportunities. The challenges were more acutely felt in the back half of the year, as concerns about global growth intensified, which is reflected in public equity markets, with the MSCI rolled down, 5.7% over the last six months of the year. Credit markets also reflected these concerns, particularly within the non-investment grade space and most acutely within the commodity sector. For example, U.S. high yield spreads were 157 basis points wider in the second half of 2015. And at the end of 2015, the trailing 12 month default rate for U.S. non-investment grade bonds more than doubled year-over-year climbing to 4.3%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">These factors negatively impacted the broader opportunity set for our clients and as a consequence for the Firm. To varying degrees, the firm faced headwinds within certain of our FICC businesses, underwriting within investment banking and our investing and lending activities. However, these significant headwinds were largely offset by client activity in other businesses. Many of our clients decided to pursue M&amp;A as the best means for creating shareholder value. And now M&amp;A volumes for the industry increased by 47% in 2015. The Firm's volumes increased by 81%, a significant expansion of our market share.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Our global equities franchise also posted strong results for the year. Clients continue to place significant value on the integration of our various services; electronic, cash, derivatives and prime brokerage as well as our global footprint. Our performance in 2015 highlighted these strengths. In addition, the combination of continued strong performance for our clients and the diversified set of offerings drove a record year for our Investment Management business. We ended the year with record assets under supervision of $1.25 trillion and robust net inflows, which totaled $94 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Ultimately, 2015 reinforced a long standing operating principle, that there is tremendous value to having a diversified set of global businesses. More importantly, it is the value of being a leader in these businesses that really counts.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Now let's discuss the individual businesses in greater detail. As it relates to the quarter, Investment Banking produced net revenues of $1.5 billion, slightly lower than the third quarter. A pickup in M&amp;A was offset by a decline in underwriting activity. For the full year, Investment Banking net revenues were $7 billion, up 9% from 2014 on the back of a 40% increase in financial advisory revenues. This was partially offset by lower equity and debt underwriting revenues.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Our franchise remains very strong. 2015 was our second highest annual revenues for Investment Banking. We ended the year ranked 1st in global and announced and completed M&amp;A. Our completed M&amp;A volumes were approximately $350 billion higher than our next closest competitor. A record gap, since we've been a public company. We were also ranked 1st in global equity and equity related and common stock offerings for 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Breaking down the components of Investment Banking in the fourth quarter; advisory revenues were $879 million, a 9% improvement relative to the third quarter reflects an increase in a number of completed M&amp;A transactions. We advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the fourth quarter, including SunGard's $9.1 billion sale to Fidelity National Information Services. General Electric Capital Corporation's $9 billion sale of its Transportation Finance business to BMO Financial Group and HCC Insurance Holding's $7.5 billion sale to Tokio Marine Holdings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We also advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the fourth quarter, including DuPont's combination with Dow Chemical in a $130 billion merger of equals, Newell Rubbermaid's $20 billion acquisition of Jarden Corporation and SanDisk's approximately $19 billion sale to Western Digital.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Moving to underwriting, net revenues were $616 million in the fourth quarter down 11% sequentially as debt issuance slowed. Equity underwriting revenues of $228 million were up 20% compared to the third quarter as IPOs increased from very low levels last quarter. Debt underwriting revenues decreased 21% to $440 million due to a decline in leveraged finance activity. During the fourth quarter, we actively supported our clients' financing needs, participating in Visa's $16 billion investment grade offering to support its purchase of Visa Europe, McDonald's $6 billion investment grade offering and Worldpay Group's $3.8 billion IPO. Our Investment Banking backlog improved from third quarter levels and finished at its second highest level.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our fixed and equities businesses; net revenues were $2.9 billion in the fourth quarter, down 10% compared to the third quarter. For the full year, $15.2 billion of net revenues were roughly consistent with 2014. FICC Client Execution net revenues were $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter down 23% sequentially and included $54 million of DVA losses. Excluding DVA, revenues were down 10% quarter-over-quarter as many businesses were impacted by either lower client activity or more difficult market making conditions. Credit decreased significantly, as the market was characterized by widening high yields spread in the U.S. and low levels of liquidity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Interest rate in currencies were lower sequentially as client activity declined. Mortgages continue to be challenged as spread widened and the prospect for higher rates and client activity remained generally low. Commodities was essentially unchanged as client activity was muted and energy prices remained under pressure. For the full year, FICC Client Execution net revenues were $7.3 billion down 13% year-over-year, where challenging market conditions and lower levels of client activity in our micro businesses, credit and mortgages, offset stronger client activity and a favorable backdrop for our macro businesses, particularly rates and currencies.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees and securities services, net revenues for the fourth quarter were $1.8 billion, flat sequentially and included $14 million in DVA losses. Equities client execution revenues were roughly consistent sequentially at $562 million. Commissions and fees were $763 million, down 7% relative to the third quarter as global client volumes declined. Securities services generated net revenues of $430 million up 13% sequentially.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">For the full year, equities produced net revenues of $7.8 billion up 16% year-over-year. In 2015, we benefited from several factors, a better market backdrop and a more favorable environment from securities services. Turning to risk, average daily VaR in the fourth quarter was $71 million down from $74 million in the third quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Moving on to our investing and lending activities, collectively these businesses produced net revenues of $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of $1 billion, primarily reflecting the company's specific events, including financings, sales and gains in public equity investments. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $299 million which was largely driven by net interest income. For the full year, Investing &amp; Lending generated net revenues of $5.4 billion driven by $3.78 billion in gains from equity securities and $1.66 billion of net revenues from debt securities and loans.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In Investment Management, we reported fourth quarter net revenues of $1.6 billion. This was up 9% from the third quarter, primarily as a result of $190 million in incentive fees largely from alternative asset products. Management and other fees were up 2% sequentially to $1.24 billion. For the full year, Investment Management net revenues were a record $6.2 billion, up 3% from 2014, on record management and other fees and higher transaction revenues. During the fourth quarter, assets under supervision increased $64 billion to a record $1.25 trillion, primarily due to net inflows into liquidity products. On a full year basis, we had long term fixed income flows of $41 billion, equity inflows of $23 billion, and alternative inflows of $7 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Moving to our performance, 73% of our client mutual fund assets ranked in the top two quartiles on a three year and a five year basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as benefits, remained roughly flat at $12.7 billion for 2015 and translated into a compensation to net revenues ratio of 37.5%. Fourth quarter non-compensation expenses were $4.1 billion and incorporated $1.95 billion in litigation and regulatory expenses. The quarter also included a $123 million donation to Goldman Sachs Gives, our donor advised charitable fund.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">For the full year, non-compensation expenses were up 30% due to $4 billion in provisions for litigation and regulatory matters. Excluding litigation provisions, non-compensation expenses would have been down 4% year-over-year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Now I'd like to take you through a few key statistics for the end of the year. Total staff at year end was approximately 36,800, up 8% from year end 2014. This is a significant increase, so let's breakdown the drivers. Of the 2,800 of incremental staff, a little more than half was due to our continued investment in regulatory compliance and other federation initiatives, largely in technology and operations. The remainder was focused on business growth initiatives, particularly with Investment Management.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Our effective tax rate was 30.7% for 2015. Our global core liquid assets ended the year at $199 billion. While our balance sheet was roughly flat year-over-year, Level 3 assets declined by 33% to $24 billion. Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 12.4% under the Basel III advanced approach. It was 13.6% using the standardized approach. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 5.9%. With respect to our method to G-SIB surcharge, we currently estimate that we are at or near the lower bucket, given a decline in Level 3 assets and derivative notionals over the course of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">And finally, we repurchased 8.9 million shares of common stock for $1.65 billion in the quarter. For the full year, we repurchased $4.2 billion. Year-over-year, our average fully diluted share count declined by approximately [15 million]. In addition, we increased our quarterly dividend to $0.65 per share in the second quarter and paid out approximately $1.2 billion of common dividends during the year. In total, we returned $5.4 billion of capital to shareholders in 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Before taking questions, a few closing thoughts. Clearly, it has been a challenging environment for the entire industry. 2015 marks the fourth consecutive year that we have posted revenues of approximately $34 billion. Excluding litigation charges related to the RMBS Working Group, it is also the fourth consecutive year that we have produced strong relative results and returns that exceeded our cost of capital. We have been able to post consistent, strong relative results despite the difficult operating environment, which is a statement of the strength of our global client franchise, the caliber of our people and our culture of teamwork and adaptability.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Over the past four years, we've also grown book value per share by 7% per annum, returned nearly $25 billion in capital to our shareholders and reduced our basic share count by 75 million shares or 14%. And most importantly we've been able to accomplish these things while maintaining leading positions across all of our businesses, transforming our financial profile, prudently managing our risks, adapting to regulatory change, continuing to invest in our future and positioning the Firm to provide significant operating leverage when the environment improves.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">There's no doubt that the second half of 2015 had its fair share of challenges, which significantly impacted market sentiment and client activity. It's quite natural for all of us to be influenced by recent events and we maintain a healthy respect to them. We certainly don\u2019t control the opportunities set, however we do control several things; how we build our client relationships, how we invest in our people, how we adapt to change, how we allocate our capital, manage our risks and control our costs, and finally, how we invest in the future. We believe our Firm's commitment to excellence in these areas has been and will continue to be what drives our performance over the long term.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Thank you again for dialing in and I'm happy to answer your questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p5\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Ladies and gentlemen we will now take a moment to compile the Q&amp;A roster. [Operator Instructions]</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">I guess you're in a better position than most to ask this impossible question, but from your vantage point everything you see, are we on the cusp of a tougher credit cycle, balance sheet recession? Are we looking at the wrong things meaning, I'm about to ask you your energy exposure and I should be asking you your sovereign exposure to Italian sovereigns or Italian banks like, I'm just curious to your thoughts on where we are besides the market going down?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So, look obviously the first couple of weeks of the year have been difficult from a market perspective and the last half of the year and continuing the dramatic decline in commodity prices broadly has been disruptive for the market. I think if you talk to our folks, obviously that sector of prices remain where they are, it's going to be under stress, that's an inevitability. But it does feel at this stage where perhaps the market is discounting some of the benefits of the declining commodity prices, we'll have to see how the market evolves. Look, these things are never going to be a straight line and so it's not surprising to some extent that the markets responding to China, reduced activity volatility in markets this way. In terms of our exposures to that sector, they haven't moved material since early [cost] across the entire oil and gas sector, Glenn. Funded and unfunded we had just more to $10 billion of exposure but to really dial it in for you, funded exposure to non-investment grade entities in that sector was a $1.5 billion as we finished the quarter. So, from our perspective we feel well positioned and in this kind of market environment, its type of market environment where your clients really want you to stay close to them and that's what we're doing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">A glass half full question of this increased volatility across some of the asset classes, using [indiscernible] clients of losing money, but is there any case to be made that [FICC] revenue pie can bottom and actually grow a little bit over the next say two years given the changing monetary landscape things like that monetary policy of landscape?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We don't generally run the businesses as you know as pretty well. We don't run the businesses for the bull case, but I think that, and there certainly is a bull case in terms of fixed income activity. The stable to improving global growth and we're seeing that in the U.S., and we're seeing that across Europe certainly could be a tailwind diverging monetary policy, could be a tailwind. Look, as we go through parts of the credit cycle it's very natural for spreads to widen after having a period of such strength in the contraction. But even right now you're seeing the market, which has been under stress, be thoughtfully selective about those transactions and there's been a lot of appetite for certain parts of the market. So I think as we look forward over the next couple of years, when you start adding in things like the competitive environments. For all the potential activity around hedging and other activities, I think you could construct a pretty impressive bull case for fixed income and again it's not the way we generally run the businesses, we'll react to that as we see it. But there's a -- there certainly is an upside case.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Okay, I appreciate that. Last one it takes two seconds is, did you say that you're at or near the 250 bucket, was that your comment about the G-SIB at or near the lower bucket, is that what you meant by that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Yes, that's correct. I mean that's our estimation. That's obviously not confirmed by the regulators, but that's where we believe we stood at the end of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Got it, okay. Thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Thank you, Glenn.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Your next question's from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Good morning, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So on Investment &amp; Lending, could you remind us how much of the equity portfolio you need to divest before the 2017 Volcker deadline? And just given the current choppy markets, what's your level of confidence that the Firm can divest those assets by 2017? And also remind us what the process for getting an extension from the Fed is if you can't meet the 2017 deadline? Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Thanks, so roughly now we're under $5 billion of capital that is sitting in funds alongside our clients, which are obviously legacy funds. The exact number's roughly right around $4.7 billion. And with our expectation given these are legacy funds is that we'll continue to monetize those assets and we'll see how that progresses. There's a lot of runway between here and the compliance date in 2017. We haven't at this stage contemplated seeking any additional extensions and I don't believe the industry has at this stage.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay thanks. And then maybe just some thoughts on the incremental operating leverage in the model, I mean the Firm has been very disciplined in expenses despite effectively four years of no top line growth. Just curious, how much more you can pull the expense lever to drive margin expansion or do you need some revenue growth there going forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So obviously we've done a lot of work on expenses, we were very early to expense reduction initiatives. As you know we started several years ago and those have continued, for those businesses that have faced headwinds and we've been investing in those businesses that we feel we've had tailwinds. At that point, headcount's up 8% this year and compensation benefits were flat, so we've done a pretty good job at this stage. We'll continue to monitor it, but at this particular -- given all the work we've done we will always look to be more efficient, but I think we chopped a lot of wood here. Now we have really, we believe well positioned the Firm for an uptick in revenues and even though it feels like a long time ago now, you saw that in the first quarter of last year where on a modest up in revenues year-over-year we produced nearly a 15% ROE. So we feel very comfortable about the upside leverage.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Your next question's from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Thanks, for taking the question. Just on the G-SIB surcharge I think you mentioned you know part of that was exiting from Level 3 assets, I don\u2019t know if there's any granularity or clarity on what that was or what you got out of, but just curious on the any color around that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So generally speaking, you remember during the course of the year that there was a change to the FASB accounting which was a driver in terms of the NAV and the look through the funds and the other driver obviously, to get back to Christian's question which is as we monetize things they become public equities. As you know the public equity has been hovering between $3.5 billion and $4 billion also and that's part of the monetization process and obviously once the public equity, you have complete transparency on pricing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay, got it. And then just on the expenses, I think you guys you have mentioned, you have done a pretty good job of balancing the investing versus the environment, but just want to get your sense when you think about what you're focused on the regulatory, the IT side that you need to invest versus areas where if we are in weaker markets and activity starts to dry up, where can you pull back on the cost front? And so whether it's on the non-com side, although it seems like that's running pretty low ex the legal stuff, or on the comp side?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Yeah, so I think -- but from a compensation perspective, compensation is always going to be driven by performance, most importantly at the Firm wide level and then obviously bottoms up from individuals to businesses and through [indiscernible]. And so that's where I think you'll see as related to the specific performance. We will always continue to look to be efficient. At this stage, obviously we're making a very significant investment in regulatory compliance. We think it's critically important. We actually think it's a competitive advantage to be best in class and so you'll see us continually invest in tech and businesses and over the long-term, we think it's a contributor to our performance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And last one, just on I&amp;L, given that portfolio and just given maybe the market backdrop, if you can just remind us of what portion I guess mostly on the equity side, would be public that you're going to see more like mark-to-market versus the portion that might be on the private side that might be more driven by models or economic growth that's not going to swing around as much?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Yeah, so coming into the end of the year, the public portion or public equity portion of the I&amp;L balance sheet was $4 billion of notional.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. Thanks a lot.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Sure. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">If you look at the size of the balance sheet, it came down by about $20 billion versus the end of the third quarter. Just thinking going forward how do you think the size of the balance sheet trends and then also with respect to SLR exposure?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Well, so obviously all of our capital ratios give us a great deal of flexibility to respond to client demand, so we feel like we're well positioned. Now, we talk about there's a lot in the past. We went through a pretty significant early shift in shrinking the balance sheet and that was really about a replacing effort. And so we're going to be very sensitive to marginal deployment of capital ensuring that it's accretive in the long run and so you're going to be as we pretty sensitive to balance sheet growth, but obviously given the strength of our capital ratios, we have a lot of capacity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And I guess following up on the SLR exposure specifically, you're obviously in excess of the 5% needed pre-CCAR, but for CCAR if you needed more, because do you have the ability to bring down some of the SLR exposure with only a modest impact to revenue?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So, it's interesting the way you ask the question. I think you're basically saying, listen can we re-price the balance sheet in an accretive way? If we could, we should, so we're doing that work today. I think if the world became more constrained then by definition re-pricing would be necessary. And so a lot of it'll be driven by constraints, but if we found ourselves constrained to any particular category, we will make a long-term decision about how we wanted to address that. Look for us as you know, CCAR stress has been a constraint and you saw us react to that a bit ago when we shrunk the balance sheet so dramatically.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. All right, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Couple of questions, one on I&amp;L again, in the past sometimes you've given us some color on how much has been either realized or mark-to-market and I get the $4 billion on equity component. Just wondering, if you can give us some color on how much of the split between second equity is on -- of realized base versus a marked base?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Yeah, so as you know Betsy we talk about in the context of event driven and non-event driven and that's what I talked about at the conference in the fourth quarter. So looking at I&amp;L as I said during the quarter, net interest income was really the bulk a driver of the debt line and in terms of I&amp;L relating to non-event driven most of the activity was really event driven or public marks. So things like refinancings, companies going public and then the subsequent public marks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay and then on a question regarding the stress test, a lot of people thinking out loud about what potential scenarios the Fed could throw at us and I'm just wondering on prior stress tests, are you given full credit for the hedges that you have on in the various asset classes that you're trading in?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">We have no transparency in to that level of detail with respect to the Federal Reserve but they're pretty comprehensive in their analysis, so one would assume everyone gets credit for their hedges.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Right. In your own analysis that you're running obviously, you give yourself credit for hedges?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yes. In the stress scenario they would perform, so we give ourselves credit, I mean, yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Right, of course. Just to make sure.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">[indiscernible] company's scenario on our own submissions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Correct in both.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yes, of course. Just like we'd model the Firm under any stress scenario.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So, when we're thinking about the commodity business that you've got, maybe you can talk through a little bit on how your positioned for the trend that we've been seeing here year-to-date?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So, we've been very committed to the commodities franchise and obviously we have a very strong banking franchise and so this is a part of the cycle and I'd say, broadly across commodities where clients are going to be in need of advice, they are going to need capital market solutions, they're going to need potential hedging solutions depending on where they sit in the cost structure or scheme of things. And so I think a lot is expected when you marry those two strengths together with our research and analytic tools, I think we feel very well positioned to provide our clients with advice and value and solutions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Do you see yourself taking share in this environment?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">In commodities -- well just talk commodities in a fixed income context, as I said in my prepared remarks, it's pretty obvious we took share in Investment Banking over the course of the year. I mean assuming you saw the big uptick in M&amp;A, you saw a big outperformance by our team. In terms of the FICC activity, it's hard to see it when activity is low but certainly really not in comparison to commodities where activity has been high to us, we've picked up significant share but that's probably not surprising given how much people have pulled resources out of their commodity businesses or least they said, they have over the last couple of years globally.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thank you, Betsy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hi. I guess, I'll go to energy and how big a deal is this oil price decline to you guys? I mean you've mentioned you only have $1.5 billion in funded non-investment great exposure but your total exposures are over $10 billion. Where could you up potentially otherwise get hurt from the decline in oil prices other than that funded non-investment grade exposure? And where could be industry otherwise get hurt or you might have to pay attention to some of the counterparties that you have?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So, from a counterparty exposure, our counterparty risk we feel good about right now, I think, I mentioned on an earlier call, if you take the example that the commodity trade houses, our exposure to those is less than $200 million as we sit here today. And I talk about the $10.6 billion that I brought out earlier, $6.4 billion of that -- again this is funded and unfunded, this is not funded, $6.4 billion out of the investment grade, so the maximum potential exposure we can get in non-investment grade companies would be $4.2 billion and that's absolute exposure that does not -- that's not recoveries or anything like that Mike. So, in terms of our capital position, I think we are relatively well positioned. I haven't gone through all the peer banks like you have but look for us, while we're very focused about and we're certainly not being complacent about it, we feel pretty front footed even on a relative basis, we have smaller exposures.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">What sort of reserves --</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I think Mike for us, if this translates into somehow, which we don't see today but you never discount any possibility, if this somehow translates into a real drag on a long-term economic activity or economic growth, but as I said before when I was asked the question and it's just an opinion, lots of folks have been on this side of this discussion. When we talked to our people internally, it feels like the degree to which the market is focused on energy exposures has managed to discount the long term tailwind to the consumer and a reduction in cost across the globe. But that\u2019s how the markets we act into are now. So there maybe information content in that too.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So what sort of reserves do you have against that $10 billion exposure? I guess some of its mark to market but some of it's not.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So of the $10 billion obviously we\u2019re being thoughtful about our exposure. I can tell you for example the non-investment grade side, those reserves were in high single-digit percentages for that part of the portfolio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So lastly just are you able to hedge some of that exposure, are you helping your clients to hedge? Are you getting additional business activity to do this, and if you could just elaborate on the benefit to consumers because certainly people aren\u2019t paying much attention to that if that\u2019s there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I can\u2019t quantify the benefit of consumers to you, but obviously over time, that translates into more purchasing power because obviously it's a good thing that people are paying less in the punt, the obvious offset to that and maybe more acute in the U.S. is obviously there is a lot of pain in this sector and that will lead to increased unemployment specifically in this sector and it has infrastructure spend impact. In terms of hedging, we can hedge on a case by case basis, it really depends specifically on the underlying and where we can and we think we should. Obviously, we do. As it relates to client activity, one of the things about this move because it came down so quickly, is it really did not give a lot of our clients the opportunity to hedge to the downside. Obviously, in these low price levels across commodities you would expect to see a pick up in the consumer side of hedging activity and we expect to start seeing that. But these moves have been pretty dramatic and usually what happens when they are this sudden is there is a bit of stepping back. But certainly we\u2019re well positioned to provide hedges across the broad commodity space.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thanks, Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So I wanted to broaden out the market share of activity question that came up before with respect to commodities. More broadly, with respect to FICC globally we\u2019ve seen so much retrenchment including a big domestic player recently. So, any signs yet that the retrenchment of competitors in the area is helping market share or helping pricing? And to what extent is what you\u2019re seeing there or the expectation of what you\u2019ll see there really driving some of that investing in the business that you\u2019re talking about?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Well, we certainly have seen it across parts of the businesses, it\u2019s been somewhat episodic. We talked it before we\u2019ve seen it in securities services and prime brokerage, a bit of a retrenchment. I think that was more regulatory driven as people began to focus on balance sheet and capital related to that business. We\u2019ve seen it in parts of equity derivatives during the course of really now last year, year and a half. And then in fixed income, one of the things that shouldn\u2019t get lost about the fixed income discussion in 2015 for our Firm is that, while it was a difficult market for the micro products for credit and mortgages, it was actually an improved year for interest rates for currencies. And while commodity wasn\u2019t improving, came up very strong year prior, I think that we\u2019re seeing it when activity picks up. Now, in terms of the announcements and the retrenchment from competitors, one of these things is it's not surprising that you need to have a couple of or several tough years and that announcements will generally lag. And so, I think we may see this over the next couple of years now that we\u2019ve been in this period of a tough couple of years in FICC and where the vast majority of the industry has had multiple years of performing below their cost of capital. So all these things -- all these constraints are now really starting to come into the fray, particularly as we get into the 2018, 2019 compliance periods. Sorry, that was a long answer but it was a big question, but it was a long answer.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">No, it\u2019s a helpful answer. So I mean it sounds like you\u2019ve lost none of your confidence in the opportunity there, it just takes a while?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Well, in terms of the competitive set, I think that\u2019s our read today. Look, in terms of monitoring the businesses, we\u2019re always monitoring the businesses. I think one of the things that, one of the things that we haven't talked a lot about, we haven't talked directly about is our philosophy and how we manage cyclical businesses. Everyone has to acknowledge that financial services is a cyclical industry and one of the things that we've been very thoughtful about is not over investing at the top of the market. So, you didn't see us do that in 2009 when FICC had a record year and making sure that we don't overshoot in the bottom part of the cycle. Now we were early to the cost cutting because we felt the activity levels declining after 2009 and that's how we managed through the cycle and you've seen us do this in the equity businesses and sometimes these cycles are long. We cut 1,000's of people in our equity franchise in the early 2000s but right now given all the work we've done on the cost side, we don\u2019t feel like we need to catch up. So, but we'll see how the year goes, if the trends in fixing can continue, we will continue to manage the business as efficiently as possible.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And then just a follow-up question, since no one's asked it, I'll ask, I know we're only a few weeks into the year and the market backdrop has been, God awful, but how would you characterize activity levels since the beginning of 2016?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">It's only two weeks, so we're -- I'm not going to really extrapolate it. We generally don't root for the S&amp;P 500 to be down 8% in the first two weeks of the year though.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Maybe we should talk a little bit about M&amp;A with the volatility that we've seen in the market I think some have been concerned I guess about the impact on M&amp;A I guess both in the near term and what it means to for the cycle? Just maybe your just your broad thoughts on where we are in that cycle and what you're seeing in the conversation levels today?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So, again obviously we had a pretty significant pickup in activity over the last year and Goldman Sachs market share grew dramatically with that. I think you have to take a step back and you have to ask yourself what are the factors that drove the M&amp;A environmental [chord] over the past 18 months and are they still in place? And those core factors, is really limited organic growth, companies were struggling to find top line growth. You had positive but modest economic growth in major economies and companies had done quite a bit of work both on cost and refinancing going into that cycle and there was high level CEO and Board confidence. Those were the factors that drove the big pickup in activity. As we sit here today after couple of weeks of volatile markets, we wouldn't say that those factors are significantly diminished. We saw a very volatile August and yet in the fourth quarter, M&amp;A activity continued and we finished our backlog higher than last year. And so, I think that we'll have to see obviously if markets stand the stress and you get into questions about finance-ability and other headwinds and then if we saw a loss of confidence, but we wouldn't say that two weeks of volatile markets would stop a pretty powerful M&amp;A trend. We will see how these markets keep going.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And maybe just a follow-up on asset management. You had $48 billion of flows in liquidity products in the fourth quarter, what -- that seems pretty high. Can you -- what were the drivers there, is it, it's for the seasonal thing or are you seeing some market share gains there and as profitability improves with higher rates, do you see that as an opportunity?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">When you look across multiple quarters in asset management for us and you look at the flows and you look at the investment of the competitors I think you'd say we're gaining share. Obviously it's been a strategic focus for us to grow that business. In that quarter in particular I think it was a combination of volatile market and increasing rates, which brought money and obviously we're a leader in the money market business and so it was a catalyst for inflows.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Just a quick question on energy follow-up here I think you said $10 billion of total exposure, roughly two thirds in investment grade, is it right for us then to apply that sort of two-to-one investment grade, bull investment grade to your funded book as well and sort of back into about $3 billion funded IG exposure?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes, so why don't I just give you the -- I'll just give you the numbers so you will have all the detail. So $10.6 billion is what I would call total potential exposure. Funded is $1.8 billion, unfunded $8.8 billion. And of the funded non investment grade's $1.5 billion, and you could get an incremental $2.7 billion funded on that side. But that's the total exposure.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Terrific.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And you can fill in the rest of the grid on the investment grade stuff.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes, we can back in into the rest, thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question's from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura, please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So Basel published the updated guidance for the market risk calculations last week, I recognized the document and some of the calculations are pretty, the document says calculations are involved, I didn't know if you've done any preliminary analysis on the impact this might have on your pro forma market risk assets?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes, you're talking about the fundamental view of the trading book that came out last week. So as you said it is a pretty big document, I think it was over 90 pages. We had the team going through it, I don\u2019t have any specific quantification for you. I think it'd be too early for me to put that out there and we still haven't even seen an NPR from the Federal Reserve. So we'll to see how this evolves. I would say the high level read is that from the early documents and the early discussion it seems like the regulators in the industry may continue to progress in terms of trying to find the right balance. But at this stage for us I don't see it being a significant impact but we'll give you more detail.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">All right, I suppose over the last few quarters it does look like the market risk assets have been steadily declining. I didn't know if that reduction was in anticipation of what might be tougher rules or are there other factors that are really driving that decline?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">No definitely certainly not in anticipation of this, I mean just to be clear, we'll approach this rule like we've approached all the other rules. We don't want to try to adjust our business potentially have a negative impact to your clients. The one good thing, regulators have been very thoughtful about the runway to rule adoption. And this is something that we have till 2019. So the industry is going to have time to make adjustments and I think that's in everyone's best interest because it actually will be less disruptive to market, the incentive of this rule is significant and we've seen that in all the rules and so you'll see us approach this rule the way we approached all the other rules. But we haven't even seen as I said a Fed NPR so we'll see how that goes. But any reduction in market risk assets is really a [complexion] of client activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Got it, okay, and just one quick follow up, I did see that the advance Core Tier 1 did in fact decline quarter-on-quarter. I assume it's a function of the increase in operational risk tied to the settlement but didn't know if it was attributable to something else?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">No that's correct. So the settlement added $21 billion to operational risk assets and it had a corresponding decline in the ratio of roughly 40 basis points.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Great, I appreciate you taking my questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question's from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities, please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Good morning, Harvey. Just a couple of questions, I guess starting on M&amp;A. We've heard across both you and to a lesser extent some of your competitors about the potential for market share gains as some non-U.S. participants back away. But I think that's mostly focused, that those comments are mostly focused on the trading side of things. Given your market share gains in M&amp;A this year, do you get the sense that that's also true with Investment Banking in specifically M&amp;A transactions?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">No, I haven't had a chance to dig through all the lead tables and I may not have this perfectly accurate but the last time I spoke to our team about this, I think it was really that there's a segment of banks which lost share to some of the boutiques and there's firms like ourselves which obviously gained market share broadly across the board, and we took share from everyone else.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay and then just on FICC and trading, you've given us some helpful commentary and I realize it's early days in the year in the quarter, but I guess I'm curious, so what the level of rate positioning within your client base has been, did that change dramatically late in the fourth quarter with the Fed's action and has it changed much so far this year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Not a significant factor, really nothing to comment on that. Obviously, the Fed reserve data, very good job of communicating to the marketplace the first rate increase in December and I think to a great extent that it being a non-event, which is a good thing. And so early in the quarter it was influencing client activity, but by the time the event occurred, obviously it wasn\u2019t significant.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And just finally for me, I don\u2019t think you've given these. Can you provide us the fully phased in capital ratios at the end of the year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Sure, so under the advanced, we were 11.7 and under standardized 12.9. I remember that on a apples-to-apples basis, that's a little bit conservative just given away some of the items actually transitioned to fully phased in, but that's where we stood at.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question is from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I've obviously heard everything that you have said this morning and I recognize of course that you don\u2019t run the business to any particular metric ratio, but to the extent that revenue conditions sort of stay as they've been over the past few years and call it around that $34 billion level. Is there a path to generate incremental positive operating leverage for you?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So it's an interesting question. I'm going to modify it a little bit because of the way I heard it, maybe I'm not modifying because it is the way I heard it. I think you're saying if I knew over the next couple of years, like let's just say we had a crystal ball and with certainty I knew that the Firm is going to [gross] $34 billion over the next couple of years. Now, I guess what you're saying is the thing that we've elected to invest in, we shouldn\u2019t be investing in and so I think we wouldn\u2019t invest for growth because you're telling me it wouldn\u2019t be there, but that's not our expectation. We see growth in parts of our businesses and so where we see growth and where we think we can take share, we're going to invest. And again, we run the Firm for multiple years and so -- but that's the way I would think about answering the question, but we see opportunities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And what conditions would arise or what would be the signals to you that in fact it is appropriate to retrench on some of the growth opportunities?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Well, we always evaluate -- and at the end of the day, it's really about the dialog with the client. The dialog with the client, so let's take M&amp;A, we just talked about the things are interesting because now the current concern is that M&amp;A may slow down. Five years ago, you'll remember the dialog was M&amp;A is never coming back. And last year, we had dominant market share and tremendous activity levels across the industry. In 2009, our client dialog told us there were factors that were influencing decisions that were delaying decisions, but it certainly didn\u2019t tell us that no one would ever do mergers again. And so when we see, when we listen to the client and we know for example that our clients in fixed income still value the services, they just need to do more volumes, that's how we'll inform our strategy over the long run. But obviously we're not being complacent, you've seen all the things we've done. We've returned significant capital, we've cut costs and we're early to all those things, we have reduced risk, improved our ratio, so we're certainly not sitting still here. Revenues might be $34 billion for a couple of years because a lots going on.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And so at times as if then the indication is at this stage there's no change in client dialog or demands or expectations.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">No. Certainly not. After the first couple of weeks of the year, no.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question is from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Building on what you were just talking about, what are the things as the pipeline keeps building quarter-to-quarter, year-to-year that the customers are saying are delaying, so what factors do you need to see some of that pent up demand begin to get released and accelerate some of the activities you have seen even at the levels last year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So I think look again at its core, we're correlated to long-term economic growth and what we're really seeing in the markets in the second half of the year was really general concerns about economic growth that might be isolated to specific markets but really that's what was driving activity levels. I think more than anything else client conviction and I mean that in all spaces, whether we're managing a client's money, their conviction, their confidence, whether we're advising on a merger transaction, the CEO and the Board and the CFOs, their confidence levels. The same thing exists in the capital markets businesses and fixed income and equities. Now what leads to that, confidence in economic growth, reduced uncertainty. And so those are the factors that fuel activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I will ask you I think a more as a peer kind of question but I think it has some pertinence to what's going on. Given the rules that limited your ability and all the market makers ability to take on any risk, turning you basically into a conduit of transactions, when we see these types of disruptions in the marketplace, what are your traders saying in the sense of, how activities and clearing levels and new equilibriums get reached, when there isn't really any buffer still left in the market? So we're seeing some of the ramifications of Volcker now in distressed markets which can have I think some very unfavorable effects just on trading levels to get to a new clearing equilibrium?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Look, I don't know, if you and I are going to solve that, heated debate on a lot of different sides around the benefits of regulation, which are obviously numerous versus some of the unintended consequences potentially around liquidity. I would say, we feel like we had more than adequate capital and liquidity to be there for our clients and that's how we're positioning ourselves.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I guess, I just do you feel like the answers at certain times get to be over blown one way or another because of that unintended consequence?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I think that is a very complicated question which is very difficult for anyone to answer, which is, there's my own view there is not a rule that has had a big impact on market liquidity or lending across industries. I think something that's very difficult for anyone to quantify is, what is the economic impact of the collection of rules that have been put in place since the financial crises that impact capital liquidity, derivative, all sorts of things. I just think that, it's very hard to anticipate the combined effect of all that. But for us, we're just focused on the clients, Marty.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And then do you think the markets evolving to adapt to all that and how far along that process are we and that's last piece of that question. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I think firms are in different places. We've obviously invested tremendously in risk reduction change, technology tools, educating our people. So I think we feel pretty far along the curve. You have seen in our capital ratios and in the Firm's balance sheet how much has changed over the last. But I think it varies across the industry and so I really can't speak to everybody else.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Right, thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Thanks. Just a quick question on Investment Management, I mean, you've benefited from a couple of acquisitions there over the last year. Did you actually budget for growth from acquisitions as you look forward and what's the investment in that area expected to be?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So you've seen us do a number of bolt-on acquisitions, the one I think you are referring to this year was Pacific Global Advisors which was $18 billion in asset and they are focused on the pension and retirement space. We don't budget for acquisitions at all. We do it on a case by case basis and acquisitions that generally are a little bit simplified. They either give us a capability that we don't have today and we think it's better for us to have bolt-on versus build organically or they actually fit a current strength where we can add scale. That's like -- that's kind of the extreme end of the spectrum in terms of how we think about them, but it's a 100% case by case.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay and then just a follow up question on the Basel III and I'm sorry if I missed this, but did you give the RWA for the fully phased-in ratios?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">No, I didn't for the four -- do you want the fully phased-in?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Correct, yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So for fully phased-in, we are at 430 of credit risk and 104 marked risk, sorry about that. I was looking -- that was at standardized, another advance 587 that\u2019s 103 in operational, 353 in credit risk, 103 in market risk, sorry about that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question is a follow up from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So Harvey just on that same topic, it looks like your standardized RWA sequentially came down 10%. And I just wanted to know, first, what\u2019s the driving force behind that and just given the magnitude of the decline? And also just to clarify, that\u2019s the number that matters for the CCAR submission, if I remember correctly. Is that right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">That\u2019s correct. So, the standardized is the ratio using CCAR and the driver, the bulk of the driver was really in derivative notionals.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Everyone, thanks for dialing in today. And, myself and the rest of the team, we look forward to seeing you during the course of the year. If you have any follow up questions, please reach out to Dane and the team. Take care and have a great day.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs' fourth quarter 2015 earnings conference call.

My name is Dennis, and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">This call is being recorded today, April 19, 2016.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you. Mr. Holmes, you may begin your conference.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Dane E. Holmes - Head-Investor Relations</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm's belief regarding future events that, by their nature are uncertain and outside of the firm's control. The firm's actual results and financial conditions may differ possibly materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm's future results, please see the description of Risk Factors in our current annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, global core liquid assets and supplementary leverage ratio. You should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that's posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">This audiocast is copyrighted material to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Our Chief Financial Officer, Harvey Schwartz, will now review the firm's results. Harvey?</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thanks, Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I'll walk you through the first quarter results and I'm happy to answer any questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Net revenues were $6.3 billion; net earnings, $1.1 billion, and earnings per diluted share, $2.68. Net earnings to common included a $161 million benefit related to the successful tender of our APEX securities. The tender added $0.36 per diluted share.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">The first quarter of 2016 was challenging. It started with renewed uncertainty about the global economic outlook, with the possibility of a recession even being raised. These concerns included growth prospects from China, plummeting oil prices, a strengthening U.S. dollar, and multiple geopolitical events, to name a few. All these came into focus during an eventful first quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">These concerns translated into significant price pressure at the beginning of the quarter across both equity and fixed income markets. The Dow declined by 6% in the first week. This is the worst start in its nearly 90-year history. The index ultimately reached its low point in mid-February, declining 10%. Equity markets in other geographies endured even more material declines during the quarter, with the Shanghai down as much as 25% and the Nikkei down as much as 21%. Credit spreads also widened significantly intra-quarter, particularly for high yield and energy-related issuers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Global Central Bank activity was front and center again during the quarter. After raising rates in December for the first time in more than nine years, the market heavily debated the Federal Reserve's future actions. In the eurozone, the European Central Bank took additional stimulus measures well beyond what was initially expected by the market. And finally, the Bank of Japan moved interest rates into negative territory.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">With all these factors at work, it isn't surprising that it resulted in a difficult operating environment for our clients and, by extension, constrained opportunities in each of our business segments. Within Investment Banking, for example, industry-wide equity underwriting volumes declined by 57% year-over-year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Performance was challenged for many of our ICS clients. For example, nearly 80% of the largest active U.S. equity mutual funds underperformed their benchmarks in the quarter. As you would expect with markets flat-to-down worldwide, our equity investing business was negatively impacted. And finally, incentive fees declined during the quarter due to limited harvesting opportunities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">With that as a backdrop, let's now discuss individual business performance in greater detail. Investment Banking produced first quarter net revenues of $1.5 billion, 5% lower than the fourth quarter as we saw lower client activity across M&amp;A and equity underwriting. Our Investment Banking backlog decreased since the end of the year but is still up relative to a year ago.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Breaking down the components of Investment Banking in the first quarter, Advisory revenues were $771 million. 12% decline relative to the fourth quarter reflects a decrease in the number of completed M&amp;A transactions. Year-to-date, Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced M&amp;A.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the first quarter, including Syngenta's $43.6 billion cash tender offer from ChemChina; Valspar's $11.3 billion acquisition by Sherwin-Williams; and ADT's $12 billion acquisition by Apollo.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We also advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the first quarter, including BG Group's \u00a347 billion acquisition by Royal Dutch Shell; BT Group's\u00a312.5 billion acquisition of EE Limited; and PETCO Animal Supplies' $4.6 billion sale to a consortium of investors.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Moving to Underwriting, net revenues were $692 million in the first quarter, up 4% sequentially as a pickup in debt underwriting more than offset a slowdown in equity issuance. Equity underwriting revenues were $183 million. This was down significantly compared to the fourth quarter due to a decrease in offerings industry-wide. Debt underwriting revenues were up 16% to $509 million and benefited from strong investment-grade issuance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">During the first quarter, we actively supported our clients' financing needs, participating in Newell Rubbermaid's $8 billion financing to support its acquisition of Jarden, Vista's $4 billion loan and bond offering to support its acquisition of Solera, and Devon Energy's $1.5 billion follow-on offering.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our FICC and Equities businesses, net revenues were $3.4 billion in the first quarter, up 20% compared to the fourth quarter. In the quarter, we early-adopted the new accounting standard for DVA, which is now captured in other comprehensive income. DVA for the current quarter was immaterial. FICC Client Execution net revenues were $1.7 billion in the first quarter, up 48% sequentially, as client activity improved in many businesses from weak fourth quarter levels.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">As I mentioned, the operating environment across the FICC complex was quite difficult due to macro uncertainty and volatile markets. This led to a challenging backdrop for our clients with weak investment performance and drove difficult market-making conditions for the firm. The environment in the first quarter of 2016 stands in stark contrast to the environment in the first quarter of last year. Consequently, there was a substantial downward revenue pressure year-over-year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Interest rates and currencies were significantly lower. Client activity and interest rates held up relatively well. However, activity within currencies declined compared to a strong first quarter of last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Credit also decreased significantly as market conditions remained difficult, particularly in Europe. Commodities was weaker as client activity was muted with energy prices remaining low. Mortgages continue to be challenged as spreads widened for some products and client activity remained low.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In Equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees, and security services, net revenues for the first quarter were $1.8 billion, up 1% sequentially. First quarter results in Equities were roughly consistent with the back half of last year but significantly weaker compared to a robust performance in the first quarter of 2015. Net revenues declined 23% year-over-year and reflected the impact of a challenging environment for our clients and the firm.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Equities client execution net revenues of $470 million were down significantly year-over-year. Higher volatility and global equity market weakness at the beginning of the quarter impacted investor conviction and risk appetite.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Commissions and fees were $878 million, up 9% year-over-year as client activity increased in our lower touch electronic channels. Security services generated net revenues of $432 million, up 10% year-over-year on improved spreads.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to risk, average daily VaR in the first quarter was $72 million, up slightly from $71 million in the fourth quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Moving on to our Investing &amp; Lending activities, collectively, these businesses produced net revenues of $87 million in the first quarter. In equity securities, markdowns on public investments entirely offset net revenues in private investments. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $87 million. Revenues were driven by net interest income. This was partially offset by increased provisions on our corporate energy exposures.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In Investment Management, we reported first quarter net revenues of $1.3 billion. This was down 13% from the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of lower incentive fees and management and other fees. During the quarter, management and other fees were down 6% sequentially to $1.2 billion due to a change in the mix of client assets and strategies.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Assets under supervision increased $35 billion sequentially to a record $1.29 trillion, primarily due to net inflows into liquidity and long-term fee-based products. We had $16 billion of net inflows into liquidity products, $10 billion of long-term net inflows, primarily driven by fixed income and equity products, and $9 billion of market appreciation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior-year equity awards and other items such as benefits, declined by 40% versus the first quarter of 2015. The significant reduction in compensation and benefits expense reflects the more challenging revenue environment and translated into a compensation to net revenues ratio of 42%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">First quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.1 billion, significantly lower than the fourth quarter and 6% lower than the first quarter of 2015. This is the lowest quarterly level since the second quarter of 2009.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Now I'd like to take you through a few key statistics for the first quarter. Total staff was approximately 36,500, down 1% from year-end 2015. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 28%. Our global core liquid assets ended the first quarter at $196 billion and our balance sheet and level 3 assets were $878 billion and $24 billion, respectively. Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 12.2% under the Basel III Advanced approach. It was 13.4% using the Standardized approach. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 6%. And finally, we repurchased 10 million shares of common stock for $1.55 billion in the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In conclusion, the first quarter was obviously a difficult period for our clients, the markets and our opportunity set. While clearly we don't control the opportunity set, we proactively took action in key areas that we do control: our cost structure and our capital. In addition, this is the first quarter in a while that we faced significant headwinds across each of our business segments. Given that we operate in a cyclical industry, it shouldn't be surprising that there will be difficult quarters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">That being said, we don't create deep client relationships in a quarter, we don't hire our people for a quarter, and we certainly don't build businesses for a quarter. Our success has been predicated on having a strong culture that promotes both a long-term perspective, while simultaneously being very focused on managing to the current environment. That long-term focus has been the foundation for building a leading global investment bank and creating superior results for our shareholders.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As we look forward, we are committed to remaining nimble and efficient operators, disciplined capital allocators and prudent risk managers. Our commitment to these principles has been and will continue to be the basis for our performance over time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Thanks again for dialing in, and I'm happy to answer your questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p4\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Please limit yourself to one question and to one follow-up question. Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Paul Schorr - Evercore ISI</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Hi. Thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Hey, good morning, Glenn.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Paul Schorr - Evercore ISI</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Good morning. Maybe we could talk about Fixed Income first. I'm just looking big picture. Revenue is a little more than half the big banks and that was obviously not always the case. I'm just curious, are there specific things about your business mix and client mix that doesn't compare as much versus the past in activity levels, things like credit being real slow right now? And if you feel like any of the balance sheet reductions or Volcker implementation has impacted the forward earnings power?</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Obviously, I don't have great transparency into the competitors' footprints. I don't think that any of the things you mentioned, sort of the balance sheet actions we've taken because they've been very surgical \u2013 although meaningful they've been very surgical over time and very thoughtfully executed. I don't think those are issues and, obviously, all firms have adjusted to Volcker. So, I don't think those are drivers. I think when you look at the year-over-year, obviously, we had a very strong first quarter 2015 relative to the peer set. And I know revenue is the most transparent benchmark you have. But when you look at the performance in the first quarter, obviously we outperformed in the first quarter of last year and obviously much more challenging for us this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Paul Schorr - Evercore ISI</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Yeah, totally fair. Okay. Maybe if we switch over to Investing &amp; Lending. I want to focus on the equity side specifically. In some markets, you had the markets go down and then come back. Asia didn't snap back. So, I wonder if you could talk about the contribution of that in the quarter. And then, more importantly, for the equity dynamic going forward, like maybe size the portfolio fair value versus cost basis, see if there are any marks in the quarter that, knock on wood don't repeat next quarter? And then just see if you can update us on what's left to sell down to get compliant?</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">So, okay, that's a multipart question. So if I miss anything, get back.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Paul Schorr - Evercore ISI</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">All right.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">No, it's fine. So in terms of the I&amp;L balance sheet, let's just start there. The I&amp;L balance sheet is $99 billion. Of that, in terms of \u2013 you spoke about equity, roughly $15 billion of that is corporate equity. In terms of the equity line, both private and public, basically the public portfolio was down roughly $140 million during the quarter and that was offset by private marks. Of those marks that were positive, they were virtually all event-related. And you remember, that's the language you use, Glenn, to describe the fact that there's a sale or a refinancing and then there were negative marks in the portfolio obviously also. So that's really the structure in terms of the course of the quarter. In terms of Volcker, because I think you're asking about the equity funds?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Paul Schorr - Evercore ISI</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Yes. Correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So, in terms of Volcker, basically if we start at the top of, let's just say the waterfall, there's $7.5 billion in covered funds. You then have to take out approved Volcker activities. Then you take out the public money. And the way we've asked you to look at it is there's roughly $4.5 billion remaining. And that money obviously sits alongside our clients in these funds. Is there anything else you asked that I missed?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Paul Schorr - Evercore ISI</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">No, that's perfect. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Your next question is from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) LLC (Broker)</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Good morning, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Morning, Christian.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) LLC (Broker)</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So you mentioned a mix shift in asset management impacting revenues. Can you give a bit more color on this and if you expect it to reverse going forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year as we work through, obviously, there are various client segments we work with, whether they're retail clients, private wealth, also institutional clients. And what we're really seeing is a mix shift more to institutional mandates during the period. That had an impact. I think longer term, obviously, I can't predict the longer term. We're looking to basically provide service to all those clients as best we can through long, long cycles. But you're seeing obviously the positive inflows which are quite good. So if you ask me to think of the future, I would point more to the flows than the asset mix.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) LLC (Broker)</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Okay, thank you. And then on the GE deposits that you got in, just curious how we should think about what kind of economics you can earn on that and any time line for deployment?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So the transaction closed on Friday. It went quite smoothly. We're up and running under the GS moniker. I would encourage you to think of this really as we've described it, which is, this is all part of our funding diversification. In that sense, we always, as you know, look to have a diversified funding base. This is just an extra toolkit for us in the financing and so we'll view it over time. But in terms of driving revenues, it's really part of our liability management strategy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) LLC (Broker)</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Okay, helpful. And then a very quick modeling question for me. Tax rate was a bit lower in the quarter. Just curious how we should think about the go-forward tax rate?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Yeah. So in terms of the go-forward, I guess if I was to give you a best estimate, I'd say something similar to last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) LLC (Broker)</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay, great. Thank you very much, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Thanks, Christian.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Hi. Thanks a lot.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Hey, Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Hi. Harvey, maybe first just on the revenue backdrop, I just wanted to get your sense when you look at the January/February trends versus, say, March/April, maybe areas where you're starting to the see some improving trends. I know in any given quarter it's kind of tough on, I think, the market share standpoint, but I feel like when revenues are weak you can't really tell market share and then when revenues rebound, you can figure out who gained and who lost. But just given some of the competitive dynamics, just wanted to get a sense if you're starting to see any of that in terms of the market share?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So, I just want to make sure understand \u2013 I answer your question completely. In terms of the quarter, the way I would describe it is March was better than February and February was better than January. It's early in April, so it's obviously pretty early in the quarter, but I would say that it really feels like many of the factors that were impacting the market in the first quarter, particularly early on, seem to have abated and although the market feels a little fragile from all that, it feels like \u2013 for the most part, that feels like that's behind us. But we'll see how the year progresses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">In terms of the longer-term observation around the competitive dynamic, again, in a quarter like this, hard to see it when our clients are experiencing such volatility and such stress, but I think based on announcements and parts of the business where we're seeing client flows move, engagement with clients is quite good and we're getting good feedback. So I think a quarter like we just had actually only makes the competitor forward look better, but we'll see.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay, that's helpful. And then just on, I guess, I&amp;L and Investment Management, obviously I&amp;L had some pressure and then Investment Management, just like the performance fees were weaker than expected. When you look at what has happened through the quarter and the rebound in the markets, I'm trying to just gauge on the parts of the business that are as simple as markets are up and so you should start to see some improving trends versus maybe on like the I&amp;L, you mentioned the provision on the debt side. So how significant or how much follow through are we going to see that could maybe weigh on that part of the business? And same thing on the incentive fees or the performance fees in Investment Management. I don't know if there's a way to gauge the types of products that generate the performance fees, how much are absolute versus relative or what products are below hurdles?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Yes, so as it relates to I&amp;L, just to level set everyone, obviously we created that disclosure to provide more transparency, and that is, as you described it, the most price-sensitive asset parts of the balance sheet. And so that's why I provide it that way. So, as I mentioned, for example, there are parts of the portfolio, as you know, that are public equity securities where, again, we may sit alongside our clients. As those are monetized out of a fund, there are restrictions and lockup periods. And so that portfolio, as I mentioned, was negative roughly $140 million during the course of the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And so there will be some element idiosyncratic movement. Sometimes that portfolio will outperform. When you look at history, it has generally outperformed. Even if you take the last eight quarters including this quarter, the entire I&amp;L segment has generated $11 billion in revenues. In terms of incentive fees, it's going to be specific, obviously, to performance, which has been solid, but obviously markets are going to have an influence on incentive fees also.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. Thanks a lot.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Morning, Matt.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Can you hear me?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Matt, are you there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Yep. Can you hear me?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Yeah. We can hear you now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. Sorry about that. Just a big picture question. Can you just talk a bit about the disconnect between the markets, the improvement that we're seeing there and what still feels like sluggish client activity, maybe better than January/February, but here's the S&amp;P up a couple percent year-to-date, credit spreads have tightened. I guess the question is, like, is it a timing issue where we need more stability for activity to pick up in a bigger way, or is it the underlying economy's not strong enough? Just any big picture thoughts you have on that disconnect?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So something that I think you're certainly seeing a pickup \u2013 if you look at IPOs, I think there were something in the first couple weeks of April approaching 40 IPOs during the first couple weeks. So certainly elements of the marketplace which obviously slowed down very specifically. But I think after a tough first quarter like the whole market has experienced, I think that there may be a slow reaction function in terms of how various market participants engage the marketplace. But it feels like, as I said before, the most significant factors impacting the first quarter seem to have abated, at least for now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. And then just kind of on an incremental basis, like where do you feel like the engagement \u2013 you mentioned the IPOs picking up, but I guess a timeline? Usually you see trading pick up first and then M&amp;A tends to lag, or what do you think we see beyond IPOs in terms of areas that start to pick up first, assuming we get a pickup in activity?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">I think generally I would agree with your statement over very long periods of time, but I think in terms of the M&amp;A cycle that we're in now, while off a little bit from the levels of 2015, the level of dialogue there feels quite good. As I mentioned, our backlog across advisory, equity and debt is up year-over-year after a strong year. So the dialogue and level of engagement feels quite good at this stage. Certainly there was an element to the first quarter which had a bit of a chilling effect for a period, but right now the dialogue feels good. We'll see how it goes in the future.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. And then just separately on expenses, obviously good cost control in a tough revenue quarter. You did mention about continuing to manage to a difficult revenue environment if that continues, but maybe just expand on that? We've seen some things in the media about further cost cuts coming. So, anything you can elaborate on the cost side would be helpful.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So obviously we're \u2013 look, we always have our eye on ways we can look to operate more efficiently. We've talked about it a lot, that this is a performance-driven culture, and the performance wasn't great in the first quarter and as a result you saw compensation and benefits expense down 40% year-over-year. Again, that's our culture, and so you're going to see those adjustments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">In terms of other cost initiatives, I know there's been a lot of stuff in the press. I guess I would really summarize it as follows. I would just say we're shareholders and we're doing things that you would expect shareholders to do.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. All right. Fair enough. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Good morning, Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hi. The CEO letter talks about secular changes versus cyclical changes and you guys have been steadfast saying that the markets are simply in a cyclical lull, they'll recover. They haven't recovered but you've kept your infrastructure. So at what point do you say maybe these cyclical lulls are more permanent and you need to take more dramatic actions? And it looks like year-over-year your trading is the worst among the five big U.S. wholesale banks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So I think I just want to clarify one thing. Because I think one of the messages that maybe gets mistranslated as it comes across is \u2013 and let's just pick FICC, because I think that's really what you're talking about when you talk about trading. We have expressed a commitment to FICC. What we mean by that, very explicitly, is we're committed to our clients and we're committed to providing superior returns over the cycle. Commitment does not mean inaction, and I think that's what gets a little bit confused in this message. And actually, as far as I can tell, Mike, all of our U.S. peers, they're committed to FICC, too.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">But back to Goldman Sachs for a second. If you think about the things we've done over the last couple of years, since the middle of 2013 we've taken the ICS balance sheet down 25% and FICC RWAs, market and credit down 30%. On the cost side \u2013 we've been very focused on the capital side, and on the cost side since the beginning of 2012, we've taken FICC related head count down 10, and we've taken compensation down by more than 20%. So, I wouldn't say that there's been any inaction. However, I would reiterate that we've been quite committed to our clients and committed to the return.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Now, look, this has been, and I admit it, because I agree with you, Mike, this has been a tough period and this has been a long cycle. But we have a long history of managing our business across the cycle. In 2009, we didn't overinvest in the top, and we're going to be thoughtful about not underinvesting but we are certainly responding to the last several years of decline in (30:04) revenue.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I guess, as a follow-up, I mean, what else can you do? You've danced pretty well the last three to four years without revenue growth, but it seems like you're getting to the end of what you can do and your return on equity is now in the single-digit range, and I think consensus has it in the single-digit range for the year. I know you would not want to see that. So what are your other options?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Well, look. I think you're right to point out that for four years running we are one of the very small handful of firms that have had double-digit ROEs. This is a quarter, I certainly wouldn't sit here and tell you, we are happy about this quarter, but we will do what it takes over time to make sure that we deliver for our clients and maximize the returns for our shareholders in a prudent way. So we are quite focused.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">All right. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thanks, Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Hi. Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Good morning, Betsy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Couple of questions on the fixed income line or the debt line on the I&amp;L?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yeah.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So, typically I think the NII is around $225 million quarter, and I know you posted $87 million, and you indicated the delta is largely due to energy. I'm just wondering, should I take that to mean that the reserve, or the provision, or the mark-to-market in energy was around $138 million or is there more there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So the NII was roughly $240 million and then the offset within provisions, and the majority the offset, about two thirds was in energy related.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. So that feels like it would probably double the reserve ratio that you had posted last quarter. Is that \u2013 it would more than double it. Is that a reasonable assumption? Or maybe you could talk us through how you're thinking about them?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">No, it is not. When you actually look at it \u2013 I think the best way to look at this is with the funded portion of the non-investment grade portion of the energy portfolio. It was high-single digits last quarter, and it remains high-single digits.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. And that's because you either used some of the provision to \u2013 you wrote off some of your exposure? Is that accurate or...</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Well, the exposure \u2013 why don't I just walk you through it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Sure.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So \u2013 yeah. So in the oil and gas sector, this period, including funded, unfunded, investment-grade and non-investment grade was $10.7 billion. That's up from $10.6 billion in the fourth quarter. Now let's just focus on non-investment grade. Non-investment grade is $5 billion. That's up from $4.2 billion. In part, obviously that's driven up by ratings downgrades and actions by the ratings agencies during the course of the quarter, and the funded portion of that is $1.6 billion, and that was up about $100 million. So you can kind of matrix back through all that, and you can see the shift in the portfolio was a result of the ratings agencies.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Got it. And then just ticky-tacky, is the fully phased in for the capital ratios, the CET1, the SLR?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So on the fully phased-in ratios, they are flat quarter-over-quarter, advanced is a 11.7%, and standardized is 12.9%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. Great. All right. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thank you, Betsy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Hey, Guy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research US LP</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Hey, good morning. So I'm going to ask a question that's really going to drill down on one that came a couple of minutes ago on the degree of commitment to FICC in particular. Goldman is obviously a leader in applying technology to traditional voice trading businesses and other things, and you've been pretty vocal in the past about how you transformed equities, and foreign exchange, and cut head count while picking up market share and the process. It seems like FICC has really reached a tipping point recently because of regulatory change and what's going on in the markets and yet the digitization process is maybe trickier in FICC. And, so I was hoping you could give us some color on how much transformation do you expect in the capital structure and the expense structure of fixed income for your business?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Well, first and foremost I'd say the thing that drive the strategy is not digitization in and of itself, it's how we engage our clients. You're right to point out that the equity business went through a pretty significant evolution. While that evolution in historical perspective feels short, it was a multiyear process that really began in 1999 and it finished in the mid 2000s and continues to evolve. I don't know necessarily that I would agree with that we're at a tipping point. It's all about opinions. But it feels like we're in an evolution where obviously clients are looking for efficiencies and we're looking for efficiencies, but the reality is that a vast majority of the fixed income market is more bespoke; it won't lend itself to that. But to the extent to which we can deliver to our clients and drive efficiencies, we're obviously very focused on it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research US LP</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So, is it right though, for us to think that there is going to be a significant transformation in the cost structure and the capital structure that you apply to FICC over the next couple of years? Or would that be too dramatic?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Well I think, look, you've seen some of the evolutionary steps we've taken in terms of the balance sheet reductions and the risk-weighted assets that I talked about earlier. It may be the case that over periods of time, depending on how much client activity there is, but the extent to which it shifts to electronic channels like we've seen under the regulatory framework for swap execution facilities, those transitions happen very, very quickly, and we adjust very, very quickly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research US LP</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. That's helpful in terms of perspective. Thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Sure. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question is from the line of Kian Abouhossein with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kian Abouhossein - JPMorgan Securities Plc</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yeah. Morning, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Good morning, Kian.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kian Abouhossein - JPMorgan Securities Plc</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Just wondering on market share movements, how you see that progressing, considering we have clear strategies of reduction of some of the European IBs as well as Nomura now. How do you see that coming through in your numbers? Do you see that at this point? And how you position to take part of these market share gains as others are retrenching?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So, as you and I talked about over the last couple of years, I don't think we would have imagined a couple of years ago that the industry would be in a position where three of the largest firms were going through a change in leadership and what appears to be a very, very significant change in strategy. That change in strategy is different for all of them, some of them it's geographically driven, some so far, some of it is pulling resources back from certain businesses like derivatives.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">To us, it feels like the feedback is quite good. Obviously difficult to see that in a really tough first quarter, but I would say on the ground, the feedback is good and it continues to improve our position. With respect to how we're positioned, I think we feel tremendously well positioned given our footprint.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kian Abouhossein - JPMorgan Securities Plc</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. And in respect to your fixed income business, looking at your VaR in commodities, it declined a lot year on year, although volatility must have gone up in the commodity space. I'm just wondering it looks to me there's been a proactive reduction overall in the first quarter. Do I understand that correctly? And did that have an impact on your revenue impact in FY 2016? Just trying to put the picture together.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yeah. So, as I spoke about in the early remarks, commodities were down year-over-year, that really \u2013 the VaR reductions you're really seeing are more reflection of the environment. While there was volatility during the course of the period, obviously in commodities, client flows were pretty muted as people really were a bit taken back, I wouldn't say in shock, but a bit taken back by the depressed energy prices and the movement down. It didn't translate into lots of activity during the course of the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kian Abouhossein - JPMorgan Securities Plc</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And if I may, just follow-up on that, do you see an improvement through March and April, both in liquidity terms and in terms of a client activity in the space?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yeah. As I said before, March was better than February and February was certainly better than January. So I would say that's been the general trend. As I said before, the factors that really were impacting the market so severely in the first quarter, at least for now, they seem to have abated.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kian Abouhossein - JPMorgan Securities Plc</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question is from the line of James Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Hey, good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Just wanted to \u2013 I hate to beat a dead horse, but maybe just talk about FICC a little bit, maybe just more strategically? With regulators sort of turning their eyes to the buy-side and potentially cracking down on leverage and forcing more liquidity, do you worry that that just sort of postpones any cyclical recovery in the investor class trading? And then I guess as I corollary to that, could you \u2013 is it possible to sort of pivot towards more the plain vanilla flow businesses that are \u2013 corporate-driven flow businesses that the big universal banks seem to be benefiting from in terms of stability? Is there opportunities set there to kind of crack their market share on those businesses?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yeah. So I would say with respect to the liquidity dynamic, if I had to rank factors and it's very hard to quantify these things, I would say factors like conviction around the markets because of the sharp decline in the oil price and obviously the negative interest rate environment and the big shift to, as you said, the buy-side holding lots of assets, I think those are as significant a driver in the current environment as is regulation, given that banks are holding less inventory globally. I think that underpinning all of that is that when you look at the client base, regardless of how much velocity may be in their current trading activities quarter-to-quarter, the core needs in terms of their need for liquidity and our desire to provide it, that remains. So I think the core of it is the same.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. And do you see any value in trying to sort of capture more market share in the corporate-driven flow business?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">The extent to which we can \u2013 sorry, I didn't mean to ignore the last part of your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yeah.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I think you're right to say that, obviously, the big universal banks, they're two or three times our size, they have a much bigger lending profile and a bigger retail commitment. So they will naturally participate in some flows that, given their size, we won't participate in. But the value is really in servicing the client and so the extent to which we can provide value to a client, obviously, we want to make sure we're doing that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay, that's helpful. And just maybe just one quick question on M&amp;A activity and capital restructurings in the energy space, it's been a hot topic of whether we see some significant pickup in activity in that space as prices stabilize. Are you seeing that? Are you seeing sort of conversations and potential activity pickup there that we could see later in the year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So we saw, obviously, to the extent to which there were financings in the first quarter, they're obviously energy-related financing activity and we were very involved in that. I would say that, look, the space has been under extreme stress which emerged over a fairly short period of time, measured more in months than years, and so I think our expectation that there will be active dialogue across the industry. Whether or not that manifests itself immediately in the near term, we'll have to see, but obviously the industry is going through quite a bit in this price environment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay, great. Thanks for your help.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Good morning. Just a couple quick ones. On trading broadly, thinking about the importance of hedge funds to your trading business, should we temper our expectations for a bounce back here in your revenues, even if we see some market improvement, given the pressure that that client base has experienced this year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yeah. So, look, we think of all of our clients as important, but obviously, we've had a big commitment to the hedge fund industry across equities and fixed them for a long time. We're always rooting for their performance, and so to the extent to which they have improved performance, it may be a catalyst for increased activity. Because in periods like we went through in the first quarter, obviously, they have a tendency to derisk and it reduces trading velocity over many months, although it may be, for example, an active day from time to time. But I think sentiment seems to be improving, but we're going to have to say, as I said before, it's still a little fragile.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay, okay, thanks. And then just one more follow-up on the backlog. Could you maybe help us out a little bit on, number one, how we could see \u2013 I think you indicated in the press release that sequentially down quarter-over-quarter on the backlog. But I would have guessed that there might have been maybe some extension from 1Q into 2Q, so could you maybe help me understand that? And then also if you can give any color on some of the deal funding markets and high yield markets and whether there's been some healing and improvement in the backlogs there, given how stressed they were in 1Q? Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Sure. So, as I mentioned, the backlog was down sequentially, but it's up year-over-year. When you look across the business, the advisory portion of backlog was down versus very strong level at the end of the year, but that's up year-over-year. Versus the end of the year, as we would imagine, given what happened in the equity markets, the equity backlog is up and obviously we had a bit of an outperformance, it looks like, versus the rest of the industry on debt underwriting, and that's down sequentially. In terms of the high yield markets, over the last couple of weeks, still a bit selective, but they seem quite strong, one of the largest transactions was done just last week and so the markets are quite receptive to good solid transactions. Are you there, Brennan?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Oh yeah. Yeah. Sorry. Thanks. Appreciate it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">No problem.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Hi. Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Good morning, Steven.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So, Harvey, I appreciated the color that you've given on some of the factors that were impacting market liquidity, and I know that one of the Fed Governors had recently spoken on the topic and suggested that that reduction in liquidity is a cost worth paying for to help the overall financial system. And given the regulators' willingness to sacrifice that liquidity to ensure improved safety and soundness, I'm just wondering how that informs your strategy on balance sheet and inventory management? Have you considered the fact that there might not be any relief on the regulatory side in the context of your longer-term strategy for the business?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So I think \u2013 look, you have to give the regulators a lot of credit over the last several years for making \u2013 and I'll focus more on the U.S. financial system, including things like CCAR. I think that the safety and soundness of the large U.S. banks and the whole system, they deserve a lot of credit for driving some of that. Obviously, we made a lot of changes to our balance sheet even prior to the regulations, but I think you have to give them a lot of credit for it. I think that all these good benefits which we all benefit from, they come at some marginal cost. It's very hard to measure that marginal cost.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I don't know. I have yet to see a very good analysis that breaks down in great detail the impact of negative rates, the fact that we had declining spreads for multiple years that increased asset holdings for mutual funds compared to the shrinkage of bank balance sheets and come up with something that really does a great cost-benefit analysis. I don't think we've seen that. But I think we have to argue the benefits are pretty clear.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Now, as it informs our strategy, look, we have an obligation to deliver to our clients and we have an obligation to make sure that we comply with the rules in the way that we can most thoughtfully. And so that's how we approach our strategy. To the extent to which there was demand for the balance sheet and client activity picked up and that demand was accretive to returns, we'd be happy to grow the balance sheet, given the strength of our capital ratios. But we just haven't seen that, so you're not seeing us do this. But over time, the system is going to have to balance liquidity needs and I think that will happen. It just may take a while.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Got it. And I know you touched on some of the emergence of some of the electronic trading platforms. I'm just wondering has that in fact translated into improved liquidity in certain product areas.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Well, I think if you go back to history, even ignoring the recent regulatory changes that both clients and market providers participated in, if you go back to some of the formation of Tradeweb back into the early 2000s, I think all of those vehicles, and there may have always been challenges at the start, whether it's TRACE reporting or Tradeweb or things like that. I think over time, those generally have been at the margin, maybe not in all cases, they've contributed to increased liquidity. I think so far the markets have adjusted to things, as I said before, very well and the regulators have done a very good job of introducing swap execution facilities and gradually implementing these things.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So I think the extent to which those things have occurred has been helpful. I think where most people talk about liquidity in the marketplace really relates to transacting corporate credit and high yield credit and I don't know of a technological solution that is sort of a cure-all for that. It's all very bespoke and that may be an area that for a while the market struggles with, but not just because of regulation, it's because of all the factors I talked about before.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Thanks, Harvey. And one more just follow-up from me. I was hoping you could actually provide some color, just given the focus in the press on Brexit in terms of how you're thinking about the possible impact on your UK operations and maybe more specifically what strategies you're considering to maybe help mitigate the potential impact.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So, obviously, we're paying very close attention to it, whether we're monitoring it from a market and credit risk perspective or from a strategy perspective. As you know, under the framework, as we understand it, it's a multiyear transition to the extent to which Brexit goes under it. But we feel when we look at it, again I want to caveat this given there's a lot of uncertainty \u2013 when we look at it, we feel like in terms of our physical commitment to the region that we're well prepared. But again, there'll be a lot that all of us will learn to the extent to which the referendum goes through on June 23. But that'll be a multiyear process.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Understood, Harvey. Well, thank you for taking my questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Sure. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question is from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Good morning, Harvey. Thanks for taking my question. First, I want to focus a little bit on Investment Management. Revenue was obviously a bit weaker, as you've described. Guess I'm curious as to how you're thinking about the pre-tax margin in that business over the relatively near-term, say the next 12 to 18 months? By my calculation, it's been running in the low 20% range. Do you have designs even in a not so supportive market environment to be able to improve that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So we're obviously always focused on running the business efficiently. We don't target a pre-tax margin for the business. So over time, you may see that move as we're investing in the business, as we're taking on different types of asset pools, but we look at it across the whole business, but we don't target it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. And then just moving on to capital returns, I notice that you issued some preferreds this quarter. I think in the last CCAR test, your constraining factor, in terms of the stress test at least, was the Tier 1 ratio. The preferred issuance should help you with that. Does that help you in terms of thinking about future capital returns?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">The preferred that you saw us do this quarter was the exchange of preferreds. So we were net neutral on the preferreds this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">But you're right to point out that last year \u2013 all the things you point out about last year are accurate. Look, we utilize preferreds to the extent to which they are consistent with our capital plan and our objectives. Generally speaking, as you've heard me say before, we view them as reasonably expensive securities, and so we're not desirous to use them beyond where we think they sort of fit optimally in the capital structure.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. That's helpful. And then just quickly, lastly on energy. It sounded like the vast majority of the increase in the noninvestment grade side was from downgrades. Were there any net draws on the exposure this quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">There were during the quarter. They weren't material, but I don't have that number off the top of my head.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. Thanks, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question is from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thanks. Harvey, I just wanted to follow up just a bit on the pipeline issue. Was there any \u2013 particularly on M&amp;A, has there been any pipeline fallout because of change in political circumstances globally or here domestically because of the change in the Treasury's stance on inversion transactions?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Well, there was one large transaction in the marketplace which looks like in part in response to Treasury actions. It's no longer in the marketplace. We were a participant in that. But I would say that's a minimal factor in the status of the backlog. And so, no, I'd say these are small impacts.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. And so to the extent that macro conditions seem, let's say, broadly unchanged over the past several months, does that continue to support what is generally a very high level of M&amp;A? Or is the tide turning in some way in your view?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So it feels like the fundamental conditions for I'd say an elevated level of M&amp;A activity, they all feel like they're still in place. And those things are challenged top line growth, slow to very moderate GDP growth globally, and so it all feels like it's still in place.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Great. Thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thanks. Good morning, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Devin.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Just want to ask the revenue question maybe another way and maybe from the top down. Just when you think about asset productivity at the firm level or revenues per asset, is it really all about increasing velocity here as client activity hopefully improves? Or are there some things that you can point to around maybe remixing how the balance sheet is weighted over time? I know it's fluid, but just trying to think about the size of really proactive opportunities to improve asset productivity by changing the balance sheet mix outside of just a pickup in client activity?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So we really try never to drive balance sheet to different parts of the firm in a top-down way. It really comes bottom-up, and it comes bottom-up because it's in response to exactly what you're describing. It's client activity. If our bankers need more capital and more liquidity for their clients because they're financing M&amp;A transactions, but we can't \u2013 obviously, from the top, we can't control that from the leadership of the firm. And so it's really in response. So I would say velocity broadly, whether it's in M&amp;A, debt, financing, the ICS businesses, that really is the driving motor for the firm. Obviously, we look to be as thoughtful and efficient about our balance sheet as capital as we can in the context of that, but it really is about velocity and activity levels.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up on expenses. As you guys think about just further steps that could be taken from here to reduce expenses if the backdrop remains challenging, I know you're always evaluating those, but are we at a point where the focus is really on reducing costs or maybe the footprint in low return areas that would reduce revenues but they'd still have a positive net impact? Or are there still some costs in the system that can be removed that don't touch revenues? I ask just because you guys have already done so much on this front.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Well, thanks for acknowledging what we've done over the last couple of years. Look, we're net ROE focused. And net ROE, as I just talked to you about, that's going to be driven in part by client levels of activity. And so, for example, as you know, at the beginning of the year, we go through a firm-wide review of resources, and when you look at that over historical time periods, that's resulted in about a 5% adjustment to resources in the firm. This year as we went through that exercise, parts of the businesses that were more challenged, like fixed income, they elected to take more significant action. And so they would have been greater than 5% during this period. But they're just responding to the market environment and there has been demand for their services in the short run.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Great. Thanks, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Hey, Brian.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Good morning. Just a quick question on energy or the commodities overall within FICC. I mean, you mentioned during your comments that the client activity was low due to the low energy prices, but I think you then clarified that as saying it was really the drop in energy. I just want to make sure I got that straight and that you can still grow the business even at a low level of energy prices, or was it really just because energy prices are low, revenue is going to be low?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Yeah. It's great question. It's less the absolute price level; it was more the shock and the nature of the decline. And so when you think about the precipitous nature of the decline and you go through the various client segments, so think about producers responding to that decline in prices and, for example, certainly you didn't see much incremental addition to hedge portfolio activity. On the consumer side, when you get those moves down so quickly, they tend to be a delay until you find some price stability. And for investors, I think the move was so volatile that it was difficult for investors to participate. We've certainly seen some stabilizing in those flows and increased market participation over the last several weeks. But what we saw in the first quarter, really not surprising in terms of client behavior.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay. Thanks. And then just one question. I know before we get into the next quarter's earnings, we'll have the CCAR results, and over the last couple of years you've been, I guess, not shy about using amalgam with regards to CCAR. Can you kind of outlay how you think about capital return as well as whether or not you're going to always be aggressive in your capital ask within the CCAR process? Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So I wouldn't \u2013 just to get a little ticky-tacky on language, I wouldn't that there's a shyness or lack of shyness or aggression or anything like that. We very specifically and carefully go through our capital plan and we ask for what we think is appropriate. And so that's the way I would describe it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, Inc.</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Your next question comes from the line of Richard Bove with Rafferty Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Richard Bove - Rafferty Capital Markets, LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Good morning. I was wondering, if we take as a given that your balance sheet is in pristine condition and that you're the very best, or among the very best in each one of the businesses in which you operate, we run up against a situation that the world has changed dramatically so that we are now nine years into Goldman Sachs not being able to come close to what it did in 2007. Its revenues have been flat-lining for, let's say, five years. Its earnings, pre-tax earnings this year, certainly last year, are half of what you did in 2007. When does Goldman say the time has come for transformational change, that we must do something radically different because we are getting nowhere? We're just treading water for nine years now. The stock is going nowhere. Earnings are going nowhere. Revenues are going nowhere, and yet we are the very best at what we do. When do you start saying we've got to do something radically different? We've got to change?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">So, I guess, I would say a couple of things. First, Dick, over the last several years, as you pointed out, we've been a $34 billion firm. However, we have changed. During that time period, we sold off $2.5 billion-plus worth of businesses, and we replaced those revenues. You've seen us grow our Asset Management business. Over the time period, when you look at our performance versus the peer group, and I thank you for acknowledging we're the best, we've continued to outperform the peers. We've grown book value. We've returned $25 billion to shareholders over the past four years, and so we have done many things.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">We can't control what happens in terms of the environment. We don't believe negative interest rates are going to be here forever. We don't believe the client activity is going to be low forever. And you really have to look at this over long periods of time. Look, I will go back to book value, Dick. If you look at it over the past decade, we've grown it by threefold. I think that's contributing value.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Richard Bove - Rafferty Capital Markets, LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">No. I totally agree with you. I don't see anything wrong with Goldman Sachs. I see things wrong with the world and that Goldman Sachs' position in the world is where things are wrong. And what I'm wondering is, when do you think about doing a massive merger of equals? When do you start thinking about entering new business lines which are radically different from the ones that you're in now under the understanding that you can't get anything more from what you're doing other than waiting for the tide to come in? In other words, when do you get control of your destiny as opposed to sitting here for nine years, letting the world control where you are and what you're doing?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yeah. So, again, it's all about language, Dick. I would agree with some of the things you're saying. I certainly wouldn't agree with your statement that we are sitting here, waiting for the world to do what it does. If we felt like there was a client segment or a transaction we could do that would benefit our shareholders, and we could deliver to those clients, we would do it. We're open-minded. There is a reason why we're the leading advisory firm in the world. We would take our own advice, Dick.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Richard Bove - Rafferty Capital Markets, LLC</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay. Thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Your next question is from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Thanks. Harvey, we'll go from the strategic to the very tactical of my questions here. We've harped on this in the past on kind of the timing of the comp ratio. Year-over-year the expenses were right in line with revenues. But if you look from sequential, you had a 13% reduction in revenues and a 29% increase in your overall compensation. So that combination really created a squeeze on your returns, which if you would have adjusted for that, would have raised your return on tangible common equity by 1.5 percentage points, 2 percentage points in this particular quarter. So just was curious, in the past, it's worked in your favor. This quarter, it really didn't.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">So, look, at this stage, it's our best estimate, Marty, in terms of where we think the year will go. Obviously, the performance was challenged in the first quarter and you saw competition of benefit expense come down 40%. It's pretty meaningful.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">No, it was. I am just saying, sequentially the pattern, it just throws you off, and it creates the pressure on returns in a first quarter that's not strong, but weak. Whereas if you were on the average for the year and kept it kind of constant for the average, then you would have a much more kind of just leveled out playing field that we'd just have a dramatic shift between fourth and first quarter. So that's the way...</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Yeah. I understand your point. It really is our best estimate. We're going to have to see how the year progresses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Fair. The other thing which I know is a hard question to be able to answer, but it's kind of important when you start thinking about just what are the core earnings and trying to take out some of the volatility that happens from quarter to quarter. The I&amp;L business gives you increased tangible book value, it has been a contributor, so there's nothing wrong with it, but the volatility does create pressures and then also advantages in certain quarters. What is your just range? And just kind of you're not think out the recession, but just kind of think about it in general, what would be the range of outcomes given that you do have some NII in there and you would typically have some flow of deals? And it could be a broad range. I was just kind of thinking when you budget or plan for some normality, what's your kind of aspect to what you think about there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">So, when we budget and plan for it, it really is a process through which, because of the nature, again, this is a long-term business, where we're committing long-term capital, it really is done under a very controlled process where the businesses request that capital. As you pointed out, we had roughly $240 million of NII in there. And now the majority of the balance sheet, and this has been in transition over several years, the balance sheet has transitioned more to debt and lending activities, but that is not something, again, that we drove top-down. That was driven by the client demand and the opportunity set. As I said, look, you have to look at this over the long term. As I said earlier, including our first quarter, it's driven $11 billion of revenue over the last eight quarters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Right.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">But you have to look at this at the long term because it's going to be \u2013 it's pro-cyclical and there's going to be volatility quarter to quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">And then the recent history of zero this quarter to $1 billion would be kind of the range we've been seeing. Is that kind of what you would see?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Well, I would say that this has been a pretty extreme quarter. You have to go back to the third quarter of 2011 or back to other periods where markets have been extremely volatile to see this kind of performance. But, again, it reinforces what we've told you already, which is, it's price sensitive, it's pro-cyclical and quarter to quarter, you really have to look at it over the long term.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">I got you. And you adjust for those two pieces, you put it to an average in I&amp;L and kind of the average compensation ratio for the year and you're really at 9.5% kind of returns. So that's the benefit you'd have as you kind of roll forward. So, thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Well, that's your job.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">That's right.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Thanks, Marty.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">And at this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">So, hey, everybody, since there are no more questions, I'd like to take a moment to thank all of you for joining the call. Hopefully, I and other members of senior management will see many of you in the coming months. If you have any questions come up, please don't hesitate to reach out to Dane.

I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Second Quarter 2016 Earnings conference call. This call is being recorded today, July 19, 2016. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Mr. Holmes, you may begin your conference.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Dane Holmes</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. Today\u2019s call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm\u2019s belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain and outside of the firm\u2019s control. The firm\u2019s actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm\u2019s future results, please see the description of risk factors in our current annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 2015. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our investment banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, global core liquid assets, and supplementary leverage ratio, and you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that\u2019s posed on the Investor Relations portion of our website at <a href=\"http://www.gs.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"><u>www.gs.com</u></a>.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">This audiocast is copyrighted material of the Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Our Chief Financial Officer, Harvey Schwartz, will now review the firm\u2019s results. Harvey?</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thanks Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I\u2019ll walk you through the second quarter results, then I\u2019m happy to answer any questions. Net revenues $7.9 billion, net earnings $1.8 billion, earnings per diluted share $3.72, and our annualized return on common equity was 8.7%. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">As you all remember, the first quarter of 2016 was dominated by renewed uncertainty regarding the global economic outlook. This impacted prices across various asset classes and drove macro headwinds in each of our businesses. Many of the concerns that existed in the first quarter moderated as we started the second quarter. This was a better environment for our clients and our performance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">This was also reflected in equity markets; for example, the S&amp;P 500 was relatively unchanged for most of April and May. In addition, we saw sequential improvements in global investment banking volumes. Activity for the first two months of the quarter was on pace to be up over 20% for equity offerings and nearly 15% for announced M&amp;A; however, as we approached June, the market became increasingly focused on Brexit. The focus was on both the economic uncertainty surrounding the potential outcome and the potential economic implications of leaving the EU. These concerns negatively impacted client sentiment, risk appetite and activity levels heading into the vote. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">In response to the Leave vote on June 23, market volatility spiked and global equity markets declined significantly, with the MSCI World down roughly 7% in two days. While equity markets largely reversed those losses in the last three days of the quarter, clients and the border marketplace continue to wrestle with the Brexit vote and related uncertainty.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">With that as a backdrop, let\u2019s now discuss individual business performance in greater detail. Investment banking produced second quarter net revenues of $1.8 billion, 22% higher than the first quarter as we saw increased client activity across equity and debt underwriting. Our investment banking backlog decreased relative to the end of the first quarter and the year ago. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Breaking down the components of investment banking in the second quarter, advisory revenues were $794 million, up 3% from the first quarter. Year-to-date, Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced and completed M&amp;A. We advised a number of important transactions that were announced during the second quarter, including NorthStar Asset Management\u2019s $16.9 billion tri-party merger with Colony Capital and NorthStar Realty Finance; Great Plains Energy\u2019s $12.2 billion acquisition of Westar Energy, and Hewlett Packard Enterprises\u2019 $8.5 billion spinoff and merger of its enterprise services business with Computer Sciences Corporation. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We also advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the second quarter, including Charter Communications\u2019 $78.7 billion acquisition of Time Warner Cable and $10.4 billion acquisition of Bright House Networks; Visa Inc.\u2019s \u20ac18.7 billion of Visa Europe, and Airgas Inc.\u2019s $13.4 billion sale to Air Liquide. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Moving to underwriting, net revenues were $993 million in the second quarter, up 43% sequentially as capital markets activity picked up from the first quarter. Equity underwriting revenues were $269 million. This was up significantly compared to weak activity in the first quarter due to an increase in IPOs. Debt underwriting revenues were up 42% to $724 million and benefited from asset-backed issuance and strong leveraged finance activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">During the second quarter, we actively supported our clients\u2019 financing needs, participating in Mylan\u2019s $6.5 billion investment-grade offering to support its acquisition of Meda AB; U.S. Foods\u2019 $1.2 billion IPO; and the approximately \u20ac850 million IPO of Philips Lighting. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Turning to institutional client services, which comprises both our FICC and equities businesses, net revenues were $3.7 billion in the second quarter, up 7% compared to the first quarter. FICC client execution net revenues were $1.9 billion in the second quarter, up 16% sequentially as market making conditions improved in many businesses from the first quarter. Credit and mortgages increased as the backdrop for providing liquidity was more normalized compared to the first quarter. Rates was also higher sequentially given better market making conditions. Currencies declined relative to solid client activity levels in the first quarter, and commodities declined slightly during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees, and securities services, net revenues for the second quarter were $1.8 billion, down slightly quarter over quarter. Equities client execution net revenues of $587 million were up 25% sequentially. Better market making conditions for most of the quarter and select corporate activity drove improved performance. Commissions and fees were $745 million, down 15% quarter over quarter as client activity decreased following heightened volumes in the first quarter. Securities services generated net revenues of $422 million, down 2% relative to the first quarter as seasonally stronger client activity was offset by slightly lower customer balances and spreads.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Turning to risk, average daily borrowing in the second quarter was $62 million, down from $72 million in the first quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Moving on to our investing and lending activities, collectively these businesses produced net revenues of $1.1 billion in the second quarter. Equities securities generated net revenues of $626 million primarily reflecting company-specific events, sales, and gains in public equity investments. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $485 million and included more than $250 million of net interest income. In investment management, we reported second quarter net revenues of $1.4 billion, consistent with the first quarter. During the quarter, management and other fees were roughly flat sequentially at $1.2 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Assets under supervision increased $23 billion sequentially to a record $1.31 trillion. The $23 billion increase was substantially driven by $19 billion of net market appreciation. We also had $4 billion of net inflows with $3 billion from liquidity products, and the remainder from long-term fee-based products. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense for the year to date, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity work and other items such as benefits, was accrued at a compensation to net revenues ratio of 42%, consistent with the first half of last year. To respond to the more challenging backdrop, we completed an expense initiative during the first and second quarter. The run rate expense savings will be roughly $700 million. In 2016, these expected savings will be partially offset by severance and other related costs. Second quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.1 billion, up slightly compared to the first quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Now I\u2019d like to take you through a few key statistics. Total staff was approximately 34,800, down 5% from the first quarter. Our effective tax rate for the year to date was 26.8%. Our global core of liquid assets ended the second quarter at $211 billion and our balance sheet was $897 billion. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 12.2% under the Basel III advanced approach. It was 13.7% using the standardized approach. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 6.1%. All of our capital ratios are well in excess of regulatory requirements. This reflects our multi-year effort to de-risk the firm and strengthen our financial profile. Given robust capital ratios, the firm is well positioned to return excess capital to shareholders.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In the quarter, we repurchased 11.1 million common shares of common stock for $1.7 billion. For the five quarter CCAR cycle for 2015, we provided shareholders with $6.2 billion in share buybacks and $1.5 billion in common stock dividends. In terms of this year\u2019s CCAR test, we announced that the Federal Reserve Board did not object to our plan.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In conclusion, the first half of 2016 has certainly presented its fair share of challenges and concerns. At the core of these concerns is the outlook for the global economy. As you have heard us state many times before, confidence in economic growth is the most important long-term driver of our business. Confidence incentivizes client activity, which increases demand for our advice, our content and our execution capabilities. While like the rest of the world we would welcome more robust economic growth, ultimately we have to manage the firm for both the current environment and potential future opportunities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">How we\u2019ve navigated the difficult environment in the first half of 2016 demonstrates both the strength and resilience of our culture. We remain vigilant regarding our cost structure, our capital usage and our risk profile, and at the same time we have maintained the necessary commitment to ensure that we can meet our clients\u2019 needs as they grow.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Being in a position to deliver for our clients and our shareholders requires ongoing investment and a long-term perspective. While we continue to invest in our existing set of businesses, we are also looking for new opportunities. One example is our digital consumer lending platform. While still in its early stages, we expect to begin the initial phase of engaging consumers this fall. As we have discussed with you in the past, we are taking a very deliberate and methodical approach to this effort. We are looking to build a durable business, so it will take time. Similar to our other businesses, creating a valuable and differentiated service for our clients is core to our strategy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In summary, our ability to both react to the current world and simultaneously invest in the future will position the firm to deliver superior value to our clients and our shareholders in the years ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Thanks again for dialing in, and I\u2019m happy to answer your questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p4\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">[Operator instructions]</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Hi, thanks a lot.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Hey, good morning Glenn.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Good morning. A question on comps. It\u2019s always a little touchy, but if you look at it on a year-to-date basis, the ratio is flat with last year but the dollars are down 28% six months year-on-year. So I\u2019m just curious, I know you\u2019ve been remixing a little bit in the employee base. How much of that can help that ratio when you look at it on a full year, and then just how do you balance between a higher ratio versus the 37% you had the last couple of years, three years, and then just having it be a little bit more belt tightening?</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">So obviously 42 at this stage is our best estimate, but incorporated in that is all the steps that we\u2019re taking. So as I communicated, year-to-date the cost efforts themselves on a run rate basis translate into $700 million of run rate savings. Now, after severance that number is going to be more like 350 this year, but obviously we\u2019re staying very focused on this and I think you see that performance has been down, and with that compensation and benefits expenses down 28% year-to-date.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Just so I understand, the\u2014your run rate savings comments - 700, 350 ex-severance, is that in this quarter\u2019s number and therefore just sets a lower bar as we roll through the rest of the year? I just want to make sure what we\u2019re looking at versus what\u2019s on the [indiscernible].</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">The way I would think about it is it\u2019s in 2016, and it gives us operating flexibility. But that\u2019s executed - the $700 million is done. Again, that\u2019s run rate, severance costs and other things.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Okay. Then your comment on the investment banking pipeline\u2019s down, I\u2019m just curious, how much of that is just off of great numbers and as you execute, including the debt underwriting that you talked about, and then versus how much does Brexit play a role in just kind of slowing things down on deals that might have been happening across Europe?</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">So when you look at the backlog, I think one way to look at it is the year-over-year, so if you\u2019re actually standing here at the end of June last year, obviously the second quarter and first half of last year were very dynamic. If you look at the backlog in aggregate, it\u2019s sort of down mid-single digits, and so that\u2019s the trajectory of the backlog. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s surprising coming off of high levels - it is where it is. Obviously our market shares have been very significant.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In terms of Brexit, where we sit today, given I think that the base case expectation is that the dynamic is going to play out over a long period of time, and in some respects it may contribute to some of the same factors that contributed to a very active M&amp;A environment, other than maybe very specific transactions that are geographic in nature, that are really driven by geography, which is generally few, when we talk to our bankers, if we continue in this low growth environment, they don\u2019t feel sitting here today that Brexit is going to be a headwind but obviously it\u2019s going to be a dynamic situation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Okay, I appreciate it. Thanks Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Your next question is from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Good morning, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Hey, good morning Christian. How are you?</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Good, good. Thanks for the update on expenses. I might just ask a question, just to try and understand the knock-on impact of Brexit on your cost base. So do you have a sense, a rough sense of what percentage of your revenues and expenses are denominated in pound sterling? I presume you have significant more cost in sterling than revenues, so curious if the decline in the pound could be a further tailwind to expenses in 2H16.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">No, it\u2019s not the case necessarily that we have significantly more expenses denominated in sterling. There\u2019s a whole host of processes through which we go through in terms of how employees elect to get compensated, et cetera, so that\u2019s an issue obviously we monitor very closely in terms of our foreign currency risk broadly across the globe, managing a global business, but I wouldn\u2019t point to that as a significant consideration, although it\u2019s a consideration of the many things we look at. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">In terms of Brexit, the way I would frame it for you is I\u2019d say there\u2019s sort of the near-term observations I can give you and then sort of a longer term perspective. The near-term ones would be just sort of going through the process. Now, obviously we were preparing for Brexit well in advance, even though we all expected it to be a very, very unlikely outcome, but we were significantly prepared for that and that really left us in a position, we feel, to be very front footed with clients. Going into Brexit, client activity tapered off, but at the point of Brexit and potentially thereafter in a number of our businesses, we either near-peak volumes or peak volumes, or new peaks, so that was quite good to see.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">In terms of the longer term perspective on Brexit, as I said before, this looks like this process is going to take a while, and we\u2019re hopeful, along with everyone else, that the parties that are engaged in these negotiations will be prudent and thoughtful because obviously it\u2019s good for all of us, a thoughtful negotiation and outcome will just be good for economic growth. As it relates to our business, we\u2019ve been in Europe and the U.K. for a very long period of time, and we\u2019re completed committed to our clients in the region, and regardless of how these negotiations go, we\u2019re going to make sure that we\u2019re there for them. That would be my broad comment on Brexit.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Great. Thanks for the detailed response. On debt underwriting, very, very strong numbers and well in excess of what we can see in the kind of public lead tables. So just curious maybe if you can detail some of the growth initiatives around the debt underwriting business and particularly any color on businesses that we would not typically be able to see in the public lead tables. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So one of the drivers in this quarter, as I referenced, was an asset-backed related activity, and there was one significant transaction where earlier on, we had committed capital to purchase a portfolio, which ultimately translated through in the debt underwriting line that would not be included in a lead table, so it\u2019d be difficult for you to see.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Okay, thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Thanks Christian.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Thanks Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Hey, how are you?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Good. First, just on the G-SIB surcharge, just wanted to get an update where you stand, and then probably more importantly when you think of wanting to reduce that versus taking advantage of opportunities to take market share, just given some of the exits that we\u2019ve seen throughout the industry, just want to get a sense on where you\u2019re at and kind of the pullback versus the growth, just given some of the dislocations out there with some of the competitors.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Yes, so you\u2019re right - I would summarize it because I think you framed it well. It\u2019s a bit of a balance, and so at this stage we\u2019re at 2.5 on the surcharge. Obviously we\u2019re very focused on reducing our systemic footprint. We believe that and all firms obviously should make that a priority; but you\u2019re right to say that as the competitive environment is shifting and a number of our competitors have stated restructuring plans, we want to make sure that in all of our efforts, whether it\u2019s managing our capital, that we\u2019re focused on costs, that we remain full service across all of our businesses and we\u2019re there for our clients. We believe at this stage we\u2019ve found that balance, and for shareholders it gives them a lot of operating leverage.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay, got it. Just as a follow-up, I guess just two things on the regulatory side. So with CCAR, I know you guys don\u2019t disclose what you\u2019re going to do, but just from a quarter as we kind of go through the third quarter through 2017, should we expect the same type of ramp that we saw last year just in terms of the lighter up front and then the heavier buybacks as that plays out? And then just any update on the\u2014you know, you guys\u2019 capital and funds that would have to be liquidated in 2017? I guess just when you think about those investments, any way for us to gauge where those are marked or where the potential gains could be as those are exited over time?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So what\u2019s expected of CCAR and the CCAR process, obviously you say the 11.1 million shares this quarter and the 1.7 billion-plus in dollar buybacks, so last year\u2019s test had some idiosyncrasies in it which led to this profile where, to the extent of which and we ended up using capacity that we\u2019re repurchasing, that we were more constrained in the early quarters versus the later quarters. And even though we don\u2019t disclose the buyback capacity, and you know we don\u2019t want shareholders to conflate that with dividends, and that\u2019s why we don\u2019t, the profile that you would expect this year doesn\u2019t have those idiosyncratic elements to it, so the extent to which we repurchase, it won\u2019t necessarily follow that profile. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">In terms of the\u2014I think what you\u2019re asking, the question really relates to the harvesting in the funds. Is that what you\u2019re asking?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Yes, that\u2019s it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay. So I\u2019ve walked you through that, for lack of better language, that waterfall, so why don\u2019t I just do that. So right now, dollars that are invested predominantly alongside our clients, where we act as a fiduciary, is $7.3 billion. There is $900 million that you would characterize as permitted under the Vogel rule. That leaves us with $6.4 billion. Of the $6.4 billion, $2.1 billion is public; that leaves us with $4.3 billion that is still private sitting alongside those funds.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Actually, I think you asked a question\u2014did you ask a question about - I tried to write them all down. Did you ask a question about how we mark them?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Q - Michael Carrier</strong><br></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Well you know, because these would be relatively seasoned. I was just trying to get a sense on based on the investment versus where it is today, is it running at 1.5 times the cost when you invested? Just trying to get a sense of where things are marked in terms of what the potential gain could be.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">I understand. Yes, so we mark everything to fair value, so we\u2019re marking it quarter to quarter. So whatever gains or losses that are occurring in those investments, you\u2019re seeing those translate through every quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Got it, okay, but we don\u2019t have a cost base versus a fair value, meaning to\u2014</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">It\u2019s across multiple funds, and so I don\u2019t have an aggregate number for you on that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay, all right. Thanks a lot.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">The funds have obviously performed well - you\u2019ve seen that translate through the performance over the last couple years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Your next question is from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O\u2019Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Good morning. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Hey Matt, how are you?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O\u2019Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Good, thank you. Could you talk a little bit more about investment management in terms of why the fees were so weak there, say, versus a year ago? I realize a lot of it is the incentive fees, which tend to be lumpy, but even the other, call it more [indiscernible] like fees were sluggish. Is there something on the timing of when you collect, say, versus equity prices and the volatility there, or is there something else going on?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So the biggest driver in the quarter when you look year-over-year is obviously the incentive fees, and that\u2019s reflective of the environment and incentive fees from time to time are going to be lumpy. With respect to the management and other fees, it really is just about mix and the average fee coming down, although offset in part by the fact that obviously [indiscernible] has grown pretty significantly year over year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O\u2019Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay, and I guess what exactly is the negative mix shift? I mean, obviously liquidity under supervision has increased, but it seems like the overall balances for equity and fixed income really across the board, it seems like the balances have increased. When you talk about the mix shift, what exactly is that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So as you know, in the business obviously we have a number of different client segments so it\u2019s full service across a number of different lines. One of those lines is large advisory institutional mandates. Those mandates, given their size, tend to come at a lower fee base, and so that\u2019s really the mix shift. So it\u2019s basically away from classic mutual funds and into those types of mandates. You can see\u2014I think we break it out for you in the 10-Q, you can see all that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O\u2019Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. Then just separately on the bank initiative, you did mention about rolling out the digital consumer lending platform in the fall. But just more broadly speaking, maybe give us an update on where you are on the lending thought process overall, and then on the deposit side as well, I think you did the brand conversion of the deposit acquisition this past quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Yes, so by view of the separate banks, this one\u2019s really about liability management. Are you talking about the GE deposit acquisition? Is that what you\u2019re asking about in terms of the brand acquisition? Is that what you\u2019re talking about?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O\u2019Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Yes, okay, so why don\u2019t I just start there and I\u2019ll take your question in reverse. So we view those\u2014obviously that\u2019s separate in terms of\u2014obviously we view asset liability management as an integrated exercise, but those two efforts are separate. But having said that, the acquisition went quite well, added in excess of $15 billion of deposits to the firm. It\u2019s great for us because it diversifies our sources of funding, which as you know we\u2019re always looking to do. Since the acquisition date, it\u2019s been well received by consumers - we\u2019ve had in excess of 20,000 consumers open up new accounts for us, so it\u2019s had very significant growth in a short period of time. So it really speaks to the brand strength, which has been very nice to see.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Now in terms of the longer term objectives, maybe I\u2019ll just take an opportunity to level set you on where we are in the online lending. So as we talked about, we hired Harit over a year ago and he\u2019s been a fantastic addition to the team, and he\u2019s built a very capable team over that period of time. So I think it\u2019s probably important just to level set you on how we approach this process.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So we\u2019ve obviously keenly aware of the fact that this is a new business opportunity for us and, importantly, a new client base, so one of the things we did is we reached out to thousands of consumers to really understand what they want and their borrowing priorities. Through that, we learned some things that probably aren\u2019t so surprising - they want a product that\u2019s simple, it\u2019s straightforward, it provides a lot of value, and they also want what they refer to as really a high quality user experience. So what we have attempted to do is take all this feedback, we developed one product. I\u2019ve emphasized\u2014you know, we\u2019ve emphasized a number of times that we\u2019re going to be very deliberate and slow with this, so we\u2019ve developed one product which we plan to launch later this fall, so that\u2019s where we stand [indiscernible] over the next several months.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O\u2019Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay, and sorry - what is that one product? Is it an unsecured loan, or what\u2019s the\u2014</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yes, it\u2019s an unsecured consumer loan product.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O\u2019Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. Would they ask\u2014I mean, target a customer of kind of short duration, small loan size, bigger loan size? What\u2019s kind of the\u2014</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">We\u2019ll come back with all those details in the fall.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O\u2019Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay, fair enough. Okay, thanks for all the answers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Morning, Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hi. So headcount was down a lot just over three months, I guess down 5%. Is that right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">That\u2019s correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So where were those\u2014where did those headcount reductions occur?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So in terms of the headcount process, the process itself really started back in February in terms of our analytics. Now as you know, Mike, we go through\u2014what gets a lot of attention is that we referred to it as a review of the 5%. In years, it varies. Sometimes those reviews yield small reductions, sometimes we actually add people. It varied by business. Obviously for businesses that have hit heavier headwinds, like fixed income, they elected to go beyond the 5% in terms of their exercise, and then there are supporting businesses that are adjacent there, so things like ops and tech. This is a broad exercise across the firm.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Now, I would point out again that this is netted against hiring, so we\u2019re still hiring, and so\u2014but the 5%, as I pointed out, on a run rate basis it\u2019s $700 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I\u2019m sorry - what\u2019s $700 million?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">$700 million is the cost savings on a run rate basis associated with that exercise.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And that\u2019s not reflected in the second quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">It is reflected in the quarter to the extent to which it\u2019s reflected in our compensation accrual, which is our best estimate for the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay, so what was the gross headcount reduction? Net is 5%, before the hiring, was it 6 or 7%?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">The biggest addition offsetting that would have been, for example, roughly 600 new analysts that joined the firm in June.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">That\u2019s a really big headcount reduction in just three months. How do you know that you did it correctly? I mean, did you cut into muscle, did you cut fat?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">You know, it\u2019s interesting. We, as you know, like sometimes\u2014sometimes I think that because we don\u2019t announce targets in advance, that people misunderstand a bit about the way we run the business. So we view this as a very thoughtful exercise. We don\u2019t feel like we\u2019ve sacrificed any optionality. We certainly have not sacrificed any commitment to our clients. These exercises are done at the business level and built up from the business level.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">All right, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thanks, Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Good morning. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Morning, Guy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I just wanted to return first of all to the capital management question and maybe ask it a little bit differently in terms of what we might expect over the next several quarters. So you bumped up the buyback to $1.7 billion, the diluted share count fell by about 2% in the quarter. If you annualize, then you\u2019re two or three percentage points ahead of what the kind of last five years\u2019 run rate has been in terms of how you\u2019ve reduced the diluted share count. So in the absence of a specific guide post-CCAR, what should we be thinking about in terms of that attempt to reduce the share count? Should we be thinking in terms of that 5% run rate, or maybe a couple of percentage points higher in line with what you\u2019ve done recently?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I think the reluctance for me to be more specific in terms of guiding you really reflects the dynamic nature of how we do it. So you have to think about\u2014and it\u2019s obviously more complicated than this, but you have to think about the three competing factors that we\u2019re always managing. The first and most important is that we put ourselves in a very strong financial position so that we\u2019re there for our clients, so if we saw a big uptick in client demand for our capital, we would be very happy to deploy that capital and actually not return it to shareholders. So this really reflects the fact that the client demand of a period of time hasn\u2019t been there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Now, the second things we do and the strength of the financial footings of the firm, obviously you\u2019ve seen us do a huge amount of work and you see it reflected in our ratios with 13.7 standardized at the end of this quarter. Obviously we\u2019ve been very focused on how we\u2019ve been de-risking the firm and deploying that capital when demanded for us. Ultimately, that gives you the flexibility to either return it or not, and that\u2019s why you\u2019ve seen the uptick over the past couple of years in terms of levels of activity. But the average diluted share count, as you pointed, is at a low level.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay, that\u2019s actually useful in terms of understanding your overall framework, so thanks for that. This actually turns out to be a related question - you caveated in the release that the environment for FICC continues to be pretty challenging because of low rates and volumes and low client activity, which implies that there is a more normal run rate that you think is achievable. Can you give us a sense of what that might be, and does that take into account revenue pressures from shifts to electronic trading as well as alternatively the potential to gain share from global competitors who may be retrenching?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So I\u2019ll make a couple of comments on that. You know, Guy, I\u2019d say that first in terms of client activity levels and run rate, if you will, run rate is a difficult thing but I don\u2019t think anyone would disagree that when you look at the trading activity levels and the industry trends over the last couple years, obviously they\u2019ve been in decline. When you look at the factors in terms of our clients and what they need, our clients are still there and they still need those services, they need them from us, and so the type of environment we\u2019ve been in, if you actually look at the sort of\u2014for lack of better language, the violence of the first quarter in January and February, and then the concerns about Brexit in the second quarter, I think it\u2019s fair for us to say these feel like low levels\u2014these are the type of factors that contribute to reduced client sentiment, reduced confidence, and as a result reduced activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Now, one interesting takeaway, and we\u2019ve seen this before sporadically, is after Brexit when volumes were much higher for those couple of days, in all the things that we watch, we could see a demonstrable uptick in our market shares. That may be the result of the current competitive environment as we\u2019ve talked about a number of the global competitors are going through restructurings, they\u2019ve been quite challenged. So when volumes pick up, we feel like we see it, but it\u2019s difficult for me to tell you what the run rate will be over a long period of time, given the dynamic nature of markets and the unique place we find ourselves with respect to global growth and interest rates. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So can you elaborate a little bit on those metrics, even though I recognize it was just for a short period of time, but the metrics that told you that you were picking up market share, because up until now when we\u2019ve asked you that question, you\u2019ve generally said it\u2019s still hard to measure, it\u2019s early days, you\u2019re not really going to be able to tell in this kind of environment. But you sound much more concrete about it now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes. One of the things that we\u2019re able to do over time, given all of the public regulatory reporting, is we\u2019re able to monitor those things more closely in fixed income than historically exists, and obviously you have exchanges that you can monitor. Exchange volumes are not necessarily the greatest indicator, but over long periods of time you can see it, or under unique circumstances when you get big spikes in activity. But it feels like it to us, Guy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question is from the line of Fiona Swaffield with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Fiona Swaffield</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Hi, I have questions in two areas. Firstly, I think you made some comments about security services and margins and volumes being somewhat down. I wonder if you could go into that in more detail, and are we\u2014historically we\u2019ve seen wider spreads, this is kind of a real change in trend. The second question was on your clients. In a recent presentation, Goldman talked about a mix shift in clients, or stronger growth among some clients versus others over 2015, going back. I mean, has there been a continued shift change if you looked at the client mix in 2016? Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes, thanks Fiona. So with respect to [indiscernible] client services, that\u2019s just reflective of activity levels, and as markets were volatile in the first and second quarter, you saw that translate through with respect to demand, market prices and spreads, so there\u2019s nothing really to highlight there other than its reflective of the environment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">In terms of the client base and our client footings, we\u2019re always looking to grow our market share across all segments, across all regions, and so we continue to focus on that and there\u2019s always things we can do better. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Thanks Fiona.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question is from the line of Kian Abouhossein with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kian Abouhossein</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes, hi. First question\u2014</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Kian, are you there? Kian, I think we lost you. I don\u2019t know if you can hear us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Kian, maybe your line has been placed on mute? Okay, we\u2019ll move onto the next question, and that\u2019s from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Hey, good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Good morning, Jim.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Just a couple of quick small questions. On FICC, you guys mentioned that mortgages were down significantly. None of your peers really talked about that. Is there anything unusual there for you guys in mortgage that hurt you in the quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">No, I think that\u2019s maybe just reflective of different product lines that businesses may have. We\u2019re not as big in things like credit cards and other parts of things which may flow through those business lines. I don\u2019t really have the visibility into the competitor base well enough to tell you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">But why was mortgages so much weaker than a year ago? I\u2019m just trying to think through the dynamic there this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Client activities and inventory, in terms of the way it moved year over year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Right, okay. Maybe I missed it - did you give us the fully phased in ratios?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">No, I didn\u2019t. So you want me to [indiscernible] for you, so just to recap again, I\u2019ll start with the advanced. Transitional 12:2, the fully phased is 11:8, standardized 13:7, fully phased 13:1.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay, so those gaps are closing as you kind of sell down the private equity, so that\u2019s progressing nicely. Okay, great. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question is from the line of Kian Abouhossein with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Welcome back, Kian.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kian Abouhossein</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes, sorry. I got disconnected somehow. Just briefly on Brexit, and I really have two questions. The first one is related to clearly we had the sell-off, high volatility, a lot of transaction volumes as you indicated in FX, et cetera. Historically after such an environment, we\u2019ve seen more of a dry-up of the business. Is that something that you\u2019re seeing, or do you see more seasonal adjustments to the business as you see in normal times, or is there a more pronounced adjustment to the business environment transaction volumes is getting a bit lower than usual what you would expect?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes, I think that\u2019s a reasonable question in terms of just the unique nature of Brexit. It\u2019s interesting how the world\u2014so the market reaction, the activity level right around Brexit obviously I don\u2019t think was surprising to any of us. I think you could have sat there those couple days after Brexit and if you were forecasting the next month of activity, I think you might have been surprised if we could have known in advance that equity markets would rebound so strongly, there would be a rebound in currencies, and the world would sort of normalize. I think that may be a little bit different, to go back to the core of your question about things we\u2019ve seen in the past, so this normalization was so quick that it actually may be something that\u2019s a better harbinger in the near term usually following one of these events for activity levels. I can frame that for you in a bit more detail.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So I talked about the merger business earlier. If we stay in this low growth environment, unless something is really uniquely impacted by Brexit and if the negotiation process takes a long period of time, then as I said, our bankers don\u2019t necessarily see this being a headwind. If we stay in this low interest rate environment and you take a look at our asset management business, then this is really an environment where clients need advice, and that also translates into our ITS business. This is a very content-rich environment now and markets have stabilized so quickly, whether it\u2019s debt or equity, et cetera, that I don\u2019t know if I would have guessed a couple of weeks ago that the market would have rebounded so quickly, but it feels pretty normalized for now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kian Abouhossein</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">The [indiscernible] that you underlined, do you see that already so far planning out?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Well, I think there would have been a lot of questions a few weeks ago about the cross-border mergers, for example, into the U.K., and obviously we\u2019ve seen that within two weeks, so I think there\u2019s evidence.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kian Abouhossein</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. The second question on Brexit is I think there was an earlier question about the impact of Brexit on you, but clearly there\u2019s this issue of EU passporting and there\u2019s clearly the potential of using [indiscernible] Article 4647 assuming there is no EU passporting. Is that something that you feel as a European player sitting in the U.K. you would be able to use to your benefit, or is that not strong enough of a regulatory setting in order to operate out of the U.K.?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I think the answer is it\u2019s just too early to tell in terms of how this process was going to unfold. Again as I said earlier, like everyone else, yourself included, we\u2019re hopeful that this is a really thoughtful and prudent process, but it really is a question\u2014you know, we\u2019re contingency planners and so we\u2019ll contingency plan for multiple outcomes, but way too early to speak specifically. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kian Abouhossein</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay, thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thanks Kian.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thanks, good morning. How are you doing, Harvey?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Good.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">A quick one on NII. I think when you were walking through INL, you said that NII was around $250 million or so, so if we\u2019re run rating that at about $1 billion, when we look at your INL balance sheet in the Q and just using the last quarter\u2019s numbers because I doubt they\u2019re that different, if we sum up the debt and loans, you get to about $70 billion or so, just over, which is a little over a 1% net yield. Is it that funding costs for that portfolio are really high? What causes that, or is it that the asset yields are low? What causes that yield to seem a bit low to folks?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So that\u2019s a good question. So let\u2019s start with\u2014why don\u2019t I just level set you on the balance sheet, the INL balance sheet first. So you were very accurate in your high level commentary, but the balance sheet is down roughly $2 billion quarter over quarter, down to 97.1, and that breaks out between roughly $20.8 billion of what we call equity, and of that $3.5 billion is public equity and the total $16.8 billion of corporate equity, and then the rest, as you said, is debt. With respect to the NIM, in part it has to do with deposits but for the most part it has to do with the quality of the portfolio. So as you know, a large portion of the portfolio is collateralized, so it\u2019s just less risky.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So it\u2019s more on the asset side rather than on the funding side.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">It\u2019s a mix. We don\u2019t have branches all over the United States, so we don\u2019t have the lowest marginal cost of funding in terms of deposits, but it really is more of the collateralized nature of the lending that we\u2019re doing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Got it, that helps. Thanks Harvey. Then one question on capital post-CCAR here. We in the past have gotten the dividend increase in the first quarter for you guys post-CCAR. I believe you mentioned in your press release post-CCAR that you were approved for a dividend hike, so was the difference this year just around timing with the Board not having time to meet before the third quarter dividend got announced, or should we think about this CCAR year differently than past years? </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I think what we intended to communicate was that the approval gave us the flexibility to do all those things, but we weren\u2019t speaking specifically to any decision making with respect to the dividend. The way we\u2014as you know, our preferred methodology, because it gives us a lot more flexibility internally how we manage our capital, is to provide capital return to shareholders, but there\u2019s nothing specific or you shouldn\u2019t interpret anything as a takeaway year to year as we think about the dividend. Those will be discrete decisions that we make as we think through the capital planning process.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay, thanks Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Hi, good morning. </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Morning Steven. How are you?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Well, thanks. So Harvey, first question I have is on CCAR. You noted in the past that CCAR is the firm\u2019s binding constraint on capital, and I\u2019m just wondering whether the favorable result in the latest exam positions you to maybe attribute or allocate less capital to market making activities; or said a bit differently, does it enable you to be more competitive on pricing assuming that your attributable equity has come down? </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes, so it\u2019s an interesting question. I guess you could say CCAR is binding if you ask of capital return and you have to revise it. That\u2019s not necessarily what we\u2019ve meant to communicate. Obviously if you just looked at our headline ratios at 13:7 and 12:2, we have significant excess capital relative to the required regulatory minimum. It\u2019s a dynamic process for us, and so in this particular year the Federal Reserve\u2019s interpretation of their scenario was more favorable than our interpretation of the scenario, but it\u2019s our interpretation of the scenario that\u2019s going to govern our capital policy and how we think about capital management, so that\u2019s how we\u2019ll approach it. It\u2019s our test.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Got it, okay. So in thinking about capital allocation, should we look at your own submission as a way to infer how much capital you\u2019re allocating for certain activities, or is that not reasonable?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes, except for the fact that\u2014the one thing I would say is that the capital allocation process itself, and now we\u2019re talking about operating principles, we\u2019re not talking about tests, the operating principles, we design the firm, we manage the firm to be very flexible. So if there is client demand for capital in investment banking, we want to be in a position to deploy that. If there\u2019s client demand for capital\u2014because the vast majority of our capital is high velocity. If there are opportunities and client demand in investing and lending, which tend to be longer term commitments of capital, obviously we engage in those also, but we don\u2019t allocate down a capital in a way that says, okay, here\u2019s your capital Mr. and Mrs. Business, you use that, we\u2019ll see you in a year. We feel like we get a much better ability to deliver to our clients globally if we can be more flexible and dynamic with it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Right, thanks Harvey. Just one more follow-up from me. There was a senior regulator who recently made remarks suggesting that they could impose some tougher capital requirements for activities specifically in the physical commodities space. I know that\u2019s been debated for some time, but do you have any sense as to what form that proposal might take and whether it could compel any changes in terms of how you strategically manage that business?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">No, we\u2019ll have to see what the rule comes out with. The vast majority of our business, as you know, is not unlike a lot of the other capital markets businesses where we\u2019re working with corporate clients on hedging their exposures, we\u2019re working with investors who want access to the commodity markets. So commodity hedging for a consumer or a producer of a commodity, to them it\u2019s no different than the way a corporate would hedge foreign exchange. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">We\u2019ll have to see what ultimately the rules look like, but obviously we\u2019re very committed to those clients.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Thanks Harvey. Do you have any sense as to timing as to when we\u2019ll get clarity on that rule?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">No, I only have the same information you have.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Fair enough. All right, Harvey. Thanks for taking my questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question is from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Good morning, Harvey. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple of quick follow-ups. First of all, in terms of the additional global core liquidity you had on the balance sheet at both the end of the quarter and for the average of the quarter, that was up a bit from last quarter. Is that primarily due to the GE deposits, or is there something else going on there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">No, that\u2019s correct. We took in $16 billion roughly of deposits, and that\u2019s really the whole driver of the increase, both in the balance sheet and in the GCLA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay, fair enough. Then just in terms of the backlog decline both sequentially and year over year, is there any specific geography - you know, Asia, Europe, North AmericA - that is meaningfully stronger or weaker within that trend?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">No, not necessarily. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay, that\u2019s it for me. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question is from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Thanks very much. Harvey, just to circle back to the expense commentary for a moment, would it be your expectation that the actions you\u2019ve taken will allow you to generate positive operating leverage, or maybe just more broadly, what is your expectation about operating leverage for the back half of this year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Look, you\u2019ve seen it - it seems like ages ago now, but in the first quarter of 2015, we had an improved market environment, we were very quickly able to deliver lots of operating leverage, and you saw a near 15% ROE in that quarter. Like I said, it feels like a long time ago now. We continually review all the businesses to ensure that we\u2019re maintaining the right footprint, so this is all about making sure that we find the right balance between our commitment to clients over the long term and expense management, and obviously the first half of this year has not been the greatest environment, so you\u2019re just seeing us respond to it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Can you just help me understand - when you say $700 million of run rate savings, from what level and under what revenue circumstances?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So the way to think about that is, if we finish the end of the 2015 with a certain [indiscernible], all those adjustments and resources on a run rate basis would be $700 million, so all other factors being equal. But that won\u2019t translate into this year because there are severance and other related costs, and net of that will be something more like 350, so you should really think of that as translating into 2017. Now, this will be dynamic of course because we\u2019ll be hiring more people, so you and I are really sterilizing the discussion for this number, but I think that\u2019s the best way to explain it to you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">It sounds like you think that the actions you\u2019ve taken are sufficient to address this current revenue circumstance, but what would cause you perhaps reconsider and make additional adjustments?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Well certainly if the environment continued to be challenged, we would continue to refine the businesses. On the flipside, if the environment globally improved dramatically and there was a real demand for our resources, which has been no difficulty in attracting very, very high quality talent to the firm, so we\u2019re also being very thoughtful about giving people an opportunity to want to be at Goldman Sachs that we want to be here.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Great. Then just one quick accounting question. I think last quarter you indicated that your expected tax rate for the full year would be around 31%. Has that changed at all, given the second quarter\u2019s figure?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yes, given where we\u2019re running now, I would say something just shy of 30 feels like a better expectation where we stand right now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Great. Thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin Ryan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Hey, good morning Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Good morning, Devin.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin Ryan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I appreciate the update on the digital consumer finance business initiative, understand the current view that this is going to be a slow build. It sounds like it could take some time to really move the needle under the current path, but is there a case for buying something to enhance either the lending capabilities or liability gathering, just so that you get to that critical mass more quickly, or just thinking about the strategy, is it just kind of by its nature it needs to be built up organically, just so that it\u2019s a differentiated platform?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yes, it\u2019s a good question. So obviously you\u2019ve seen us do a number of smaller bolt-on acquisitions in IMD, and the thesis behind those, because we\u2019re certainly not reluctant to do that, is when we feel like we had a capability that we would\u2014if there\u2019s a service we\u2019d like to enhance for our clients or a capability that we\u2019re quite good at, that we think we can add scale to, we\u2019ll just weigh the costs and benefits of acquiring versus building in-house. </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">This particular effort, when we looked at it, we really felt like best designed from scratch, and the reason for that is I think we\u2019re kind of uniquely positioned. It allows us to leverage our technology skills and our risk skills, but this is really about if you look at sort of the competitive landscape, there are benefits that online lending platforms provide to consumers and there are benefits that large commercial providers of credit provide to consumers. We\u2019re just really looking to bridge the gap between those strengths and offer consumers as best we can a really thoughtful and differentiated product.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin Ryan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Got it, that\u2019s very helpful. Separately, just love some thoughts about how you guys are thinking about the upcoming election just as an influence on business, either from a client perspective or even how you\u2019re thinking about planning in your business. There\u2019s been a lot of rhetoric just around some pretty bold proposals recently, reinstating Glass-Steagall, for example in financials, some similar kind of bold themes in other sectors. I\u2019m just curious how much is this uncertainty into the election delaying decision-making, if at all, or keeping a lid on client activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Look, I think this cycle will have its unique aspects to it versus other presidential cycles, but historically there\u2019s always been some element which may have ultimately deferred a decision that a client might make to a later period. But these are short term in nature, so we don\u2019t see any significant impact in terms of the near term.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin Ryan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Got it, okay. Just last one quickly - the decline in VAR, I know that can bounce around, but was that just de-risking into the U.K. referendum or just the reduced volatility? Just curious what drove that - it was at the lowest level in quite some time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">It was a combination. Obviously the VAR declined pretty meaningfully in average over the quarter. Really, that was a combination of two factors. There was reduced client activity going into Brexit, and as I mentioned earlier, we were being pretty prudent as we approached the date.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin Ryan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Understood, got it. Thanks Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question is from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thanks. Harvey, I wanted to go back into the CCAR and think about adjustments on operational risk. Like we had talked about, there had been some double counting. You did get a benefit of 250 basis points, so to speak, in your minimum ratios going higher. Is that\u2014you know, as we talked about double counting and SIFI possibly going into CCAR, it looks like you got a break on operational risk that almost equals your SIFI charge almost exactly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">We don\u2019t have any visibility into those calculations, Marty. As you know, there\u2019s no transparency in that process, so I really can\u2019t comment. I think this year\u2019s test and last year\u2019s test and the year prior to that, I think it just confirms what the Federal Reserve has been very clear about. Their test is going to be dynamic from year to year. They\u2019re going to incorporate lots of different variables - that\u2019s how they designed it, so I actually think they\u2019re just fulfilling their design criteria.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">The other thing I was going to ask you was on this quarter and the headcount reductions, where the severance costs would probably hit, when you look at kind of dividing it, if you just said well, you\u2019re at full run rate in the second quarter, which I know you probably weren\u2019t, but $175 million per quarter, and then you look at the net for the year you\u2019re talking about for this year of being 350 net severance then being possible $350 million, I was trying to think of the timing in relation to the gains in the sense of the expense savings and how that might have affected the second quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yes, so the way to think about it is on an annualized basis, Marty, so you should incorporate those numbers as $700 million on a run rate basis, that run rate basis\u2014and this is again a very sterilized way we\u2019re doing this conversation. That\u2019s all other factors being equal going into 2017, and this year that will translate roughly into $350 million of savings this year. How that flows through quarter to quarter, that\u2019s very specific to a number of circumstances. </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Would it be safe to say that a majority of the severance was going to be at least in the second quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Some, but not all. </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Hey, morning Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Hey Brian.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I just had a quick question on the Volcker investments. I know you said previously that there is a chance that it could get extended as you get into 2017, but there\u2019s really been no discussion as far as I\u2019ve seen with regards to that. So how should we think about those Volcker investments over the course of next year? Is it really just some type of liquidity event in 2Q17 that will become or happen because if there is no extension or you\u2019re just going to take a wait-and-see approach on winding those down?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So as I mentioned before, we have $4.3 billion that\u2019s private, $2.1 billion\u2014I went through the waterfall, so I won\u2019t do it again. You would have seen a communication from the regulators that basically spoke to the confirmation of the extension to 2017, and then there\u2019s been public submissions in terms of industry-wide requests for incremental extensions, which I believe under the Volcker interpretations can be as much as an incremental five years. </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">If you remember, if you go back to the genesis of Volcker, it wasn\u2019t designed to force fire sales or anything like that, so the industry again has been working with the regulators through various bodies, and we\u2019ll see how the regulators finally respond to that. But I think the industry has done a good job, as have we, of bringing down these levels, but we\u2019re sitting alongside our clients mostly in these funds, so we don\u2019t have unilateral authority just to sell these assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay, good. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">That\u2019s great. Since there aren\u2019t any more questions, we just want to thank everybody for joining the call. Hopefully we\u2019ll all get to see you over the course of the coming months. If you have any other questions, give a call into Dane and the team; but otherwise thanks again for participating and have a great summer. </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs second quarter 2016 earnings conference call.

My name is Dennis, and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today, October 18, 2016.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you. Mr. Holmes, you may begin your conference.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Dane Holmes</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm's belief regarding future events that, by their nature are uncertain and outside of the firm's control. The firm's actual results and financial condition may differ possibly materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm's future results, please see the description of Risk Factors in our current annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, global core liquid assets and supplementary leverage ratio and you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that's posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">This audio cast is copyrighted material to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent. Our Chief Financial Officer, Harvey Schwartz, will now review the firm's results. Harvey?</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thanks Dane and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I'll walk you through the third quarter and year-to-date results and am happy to answer any questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Net revenues were $8.2 billion, net earnings $2.1 billion. Earnings per diluted share $4.88 and our annualized return on common equity was 11.2%. For the year-to-date, net revenues were $22.4 billion, net earnings $5.1 billion, earnings per diluted share $11.24 and our annualized return on common equity was 8.7%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Relative to the first quarter of this year, the second and now the third quarter, have shown steady improvement. This improvement is reflected in third-quarter revenues, which increased 19% year-over-year. We also had a modest sequential increase which is particularly noteworthy given the third quarter is often seasonally slower.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">A few factors contributed to the enhanced operating environment. The markets generally improved with equity prices steadily moving higher. The S&amp;P 500 was up 3.3% in the third quarter. The MSCI World increased by 4.8% and the VIX declined by 15%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Credit spreads also tightened during the quarter with U.S. investment grade and high yield cash spreads tighter by 12 basis points and 87 basis points respectively. In addition, there weren't any major changes to the global economic outlook over the course of the quarter. For example consensus estimates for global GDP growth remained roughly consistent.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Ultimately a more favorable backdrop and improved client sentiment translated into year-over-year revenue growth in three of our four business segments. Now let's discuss them.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Investment banking produced third quarter revenues of $1.5 billion, 14% lower than a strong second quarter. Although revenues declined sequentially, our investment banking backlog remained robust and was up versus last quarter. Breaking down the components of investment banking in the quarter, advisory revenues were $658 million down 17% compared to the second quarter as industry-wide completed activity declined.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Year-to-date Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced and completed M&amp;A. We advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the third quarter, including ARM holdings \u00a324.4 billion sale to Softbank Group. AGL Resources $12 billion merger with Southern Company and Lockheed Martin's $5 billion spinoff and merger of its IS&amp;GS business into Leidos.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We also advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the third quarter, including WhiteWave Foods $12.5 billion sale to Group Danone. Hewlett-Packard Enterprises' $8.8 billion spin off and merger of non-core software assets with Micro Focus International and Abbott Medical Optics' $4.3 billion sale to Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Moving down to revenue, revenues were $879 million in the third quarter, down 11% sequentially, due to a decline in both debt and equity underwriting. Equity underwriting revenues were $227 million down 16% compared to the second quarter due to a continued weak backdrop for equity issuance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">However the end of the quarter was significantly more active in the beginning with more than half of the quarter's IPO volume occurring in September. Debt underwriting revenues of $652 million were down 10% quarter-over-quarter, following a robust second quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">For the first nine months of the year debt amortizing produced record year-to-date results. During the third quarter, we actively supported our client's financing needs, participating in Postal Savings Bank of China's $7.4 billion IPO, Great Plains Energy's $2.5 billion follow-on and convertible offering to support its purchase of Westar and Fortis' $2 billion investment grade offering for the purchase of ITC.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our FICC and equities businesses, net revenues were $3.7 billion in the third quarter up 2%compared to the second quarter. FICC client execution net revenues were $2 billion in the third quarter up 2% sequentially.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Credit increased and benefited from strong primary issuance and tighter spreads. Mortgage also increased and included better market-making conditions even tighter spreads. Rates was down slightly as client activity was driven by the continued discussion around potential Central Bank actions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Currencies was essentially unchanged compared to the second quarter with lower client activity, particularly post the Brexit vote and commodities declined during the quarter as activity remained light. In equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees and security services, net revenues for the third quarter were $1.8 billion up 2% quarter-over-quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Equities client execution net revenues of $678 million were up 16% sequentially, reflecting better market-making conditions. Commissions and fees were $719 million, down 3% quarter-over-quarter. Security services generated net revenues of $387 million down 8% relative to the seasonally stronger second quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Turning to risk, average daily volume in the third quarter declined to $57 million, down $5 million sequentially. Moving on to our investing and lending activities, collectively these businesses produced net revenues of $1.4 billion in the third quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of $920 million, reflecting company-specific events, sale and gains in public equity investments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $478 million and included approximately $275 million of net interest income. Investment management we reported third-quarter net revenues of $1.5 billion up 10% from the second quarter as incentive fees, management fees and transaction revenues all increased.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Assets under supervision increased $37 billion sequentially to a record $1.35 trillion. The increase was due to net market appreciation and net inflows. Long-term fee-based net inflows of $14 billion were primarily driven by fixed-income products.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Now let me turn to expenses, year-to-date compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior your equity awards and other items such as benefits declined by 13%. This was roughly in line with net revenues.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">The 13% year-to-date decline results in a compensation to net revenues ratio of 41%. This is a hundred basis points lower in the funds accrual in the first half of this year. Third-quarter noncompetition expenses were $2.1 billion down slightly compared to the second quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Now I would like to take you through a few key statistics. Total staff was approximately 34,900 roughly flat with the second quarter. Our effective tax rate for the year-to-date was 26.9%. Our global core liquid asset ended the third quarter at $214 billion and our balance sheet was $880 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14% using the standardized approach. It was 12.4% under the Basel 3 advanced approach. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 6.3%. In the quarter we repurchased 7.8 million shares for $1.3 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In terms of capital, our ratios have significantly strengthened over the last several years. This reflects the transformation of our balance sheet and our cumulative effort to de-risk the firm. All of these actions, combined with more than $30 billion of earnings since 2011, position the firm to grow our capital ratios and simultaneously bring our basic share count to its lowest point ever.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Before I wrap up, I want to cover three topics, our client franchise, expense initiatives and new opportunities. With respect to global client franchise, it's in great shape. We have a strong position in each of our four segments, investment banking, institutional client services, investing in lending and investment management.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">While many of our clients are currently challenged by the low growth environment, we are committed to partnering with them and they look to navigate these headwinds. On expenses, last quarter we discussed the $700 million savings initiative that we undertook in the first half of the year and we continue to look at additional means of improving our efficiency without impacting our global client franchise.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Focusing on operating efficiency, not only positions us for margin expansion in better environments, but it also provides additional benefits. It allows the firm to maintain its global footprint and to continue to invest in the future, which is an essential component of sustainable value creation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">While there are currently economic headwinds in several countries globally, our focus on efficiency across all of our businesses and regions allows the firm not only to maintain, but also to invest in our client franchise through the cycle. Additionally, our expense discipline allows us to invest in new opportunities. Last week we launched a new online personal loan platform Marcus by Goldman Sachs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Marcus' goal is to enter the consumer credit market and provide a product that is simple, transparent, flexible and provides consumers with real value. Like any new effort, we are taking a slow and methodical approach with Marcus. We are leveraging all the firm's pre-existing strengths across risk management and technology and we have brought an experienced team of consumer lending professionals to drive Marcus forward led by Harit Talwar.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Before taking your questions, I would like to leave you with one thought. The firm is as focused on navigating today's environment, as we are on preparing for the future. You have to do the first really well to be in a position to do the latter. Thanks again for dialing in and I am happy to answer your questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p4\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Hi thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Hey, good morning, Glenn.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">So I appreciate the color around things related to FICC and I've a question of overall backdrop. In the first quarter of '15, the Swiss re-pegged stuff went bonkers for a couple weeks and you made tons of money even more than the overall industry. This quarter it didn't seem like there was too many aha moment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Credit spreads tightened and they had aftermath of Brexit and stuff, but in your text you point out low rates and slow economic growth as headwinds for FICC. You talk about lower market firms and volatility and equities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">I'm just curious when you look at the quarter we just had in FICC particularly, is it more like you had a nice pickup like first quarter of '15 and you're setting this up for keep calm like things have returned back to normal or is this possibly a little bit higher activity environment given the uncertainty?</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">So it's a great question, year-over-year we were up 49% on a core basis. I think in some respects that speaks to a weaker third quarter environment last year, but I have to agree with you. I wouldn't say it was a particularly strong quarter for FICC. Year-over-year I talked about some of the drivers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">I would say maybe the best way to describe, it wasn't so much -- it wasn't so much about tailwind as it was about not having so many headwinds in the quarter and of course we translated nicely for us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">I'll take it if it will get a little bit higher operating environment. One last one on I&amp;L, it's interesting that multiples -- take up multiples were near their highs and you would expect a lot of exits. This one happened to be a better quarter. You talked about some company-specific events, some sales and the up markets, but I guess the question is, is are you finding opportunities that will also put money to work especially on the equity side.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">I saw the UFC deal and I am a huge Conor McGregor fan, but that was close to six times, the six times cap. So curious about how you see the investing environment for I&amp;L?</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">So the opportunities for a while have been more on the debt side. You've seen the I&amp;L balance sheet transition. When you see it again this quarter it is going to close to 80% debt, but selectively we're certainly seeing opportunities whether they be in what we recall other forms of equity, real estate or other areas, but selectively we've seen some good opportunities in corporate equity. As you're probably seeing, we're in a market now raising a fund, and the reception to that has been quite strong.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">How big is the I&amp;L balance sheet now? You said its 80% Fixed Income, but it's over 100 now?</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">So just to give you the exact number, it's 98.9 billion, [indiscernible] just under 99 billion, and that's up $1.8 billion quarter-over-quarter. And I said almost 80%. It's 78% really debt and other assets, which leaves you basically with $21.5 billion of what we would categorize as equity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">All right. Awesome. Thanks. Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Sure. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Your next question is from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Good morning Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Hey Christian.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">So a question on your consumer lending efforts, given the firm will be facing a very different demographic than you have historically faced, may we just talk about how you think about reputational risks and how you mitigate it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Yes, so it's a great question. So I think the short answer is providing value to the consumer. So one of the reasons we have said so many times and this is going to be a very deliberate and methodical approach and a bit of crawl before we walk in this business is because we're well aware that this is a new effort for us. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Now and some of this is not new for us, our technology skills, the risk management, but the interface through the technology with this new important client base, it's a different space for us. So we've hired, obviously, people with decades of experience. But I think the greatest mitigating factor is slow growth, monitoring it very closely. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">But also, when we put this together, we took input from consumers, and it really is, I don't know if it's the first-ever, but it\u2019s really is a lending product that is driven by consumer input. And so that means providing them with flexibility, with real value, with simplicity. And that's why we've come out with something, and we got feedback, consumers don't necessarily like and they don't understand the fee structures. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So we created a no-fee product, no small print. If you call our call centers, people pick up. Some of these things are simple, but they're quite important in terms of what consumers want. And if you deliver what consumers want and you really control your processes, then obviously, you create value and you deliver what regulators want also.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Okay. That's helpful. And then just a cleanup question. On the buyback, $1.2 billion in the quarter, which is a bit lower than the first half run rate. I know the last CCAR cycle buybacks were back-end weighted. How should we think about the pace for this cycle?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So you're right. A year ago, there were some [indiscernible] that attach, which led to more backend weighted profile. This year, we had a bit of flexibility in terms of how we'll approach the next couple of quarters, but a lot of this i6s going to be driven by edging out the environment and demand for the balance sheet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We would really like to start putting our capital to work if the environment improved from where it is today. But certainly, there's some flexibility in the profile for us to go up a little bit from these levels. But again, certainly not committing to that. You know how we think about capital management, and share repurchase for us is not to be equated with dividends and so it's going to be dynamic.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Okay, thank you Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Thanks Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Hi, Mike</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Can you just first, question on capital ratios. Your ratio continues to improve. Based on we had some recent comments by [indiscernible] and where CCAR is heading into '18, did anything change in how you managed through that process?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">And then just with your last comments on the last question on balancing buybacks versus investments, are you starting to see some opportunities to make investments? And maybe it's because of market share opportunities globally but just wanted to get your thoughts on that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So again, on the ratios, as I mentioned, 14 under standardized and 12 4 are advanced. By the way, just [indiscernible] and I'll know I get the question Mike, its 13.4 standardized fully phased and 11 9 on the advanced fully phased. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">In terms of the stress testing, white paper and govern it relates comments I'd say at a high level, obviously, they put a ton of work into this with various constituencies. We \u2013 our initial frameworks were their framework seem quite awful. And it seems somewhat consistent with the way we actually manage the firm. So we manage the firm obviously on the forward-looking basis in terms of how we stress tests. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We obviously also manage the spot capital ratios. And under our spot capital ratios, as you can see, we have lots of capacity. And so we'll have to see ultimately the details in the MPR, but again, they did the right thing here by giving the bank the opportunity to make adjustments because as you know, this won't be incorporated into the 2017 cycle. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">And so the extent to which firms need to adapt, will be able to adapt after we see the MPR. But I think our starting point puts us in a great position and again the treatment of share repurchase and we'll see what happens with balance sheet and other things. But we'll take our normal approach in terms of capital management from here. But it seems like the right direction.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on I&amp;L. When you look at some of the things that the Fed has put out there on physical commodities and some of the pressures on that part of the market versus what you guys have been doing on the debt side, just where do you see the outlook based on maybe some of these potential changes, the increase in RWAs? And what you can still grow versus what could potentially be at risk?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So that's a great question. In terms of why we just talked about commodities MPR. So the market's been waiting for this for a while. As you know, we've been in the commodity business for decades, and we think it's really important that the Federal Reserve\u2019s taken the lead here in terms of an important area of focus for us in the industry, but especially as it relates to ultimately establishing uniform standards across the industry. So we welcome all that. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">With respect to our business, we've obviously been very vocal in our commitment to the commodity business, and some of that I think maybe that gets misunderstood. So I want to underscore for you a bit. What we're committed to is serving our clients and their needs and you kind unpack that a bit and simplify by saying there's really three activities that are critical to our clients. It's critical for them to hedge, and that's consumers and producers would have commodity price exposure.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Financing of those businesses is critical. And then obviously, market-making activities, which provide liquidity to the markets under a critical component of making those markets function. That's what we're most committed to. You've seen over the years, we've been reducing on balance sheet, investing in commodities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">And so we'll work with the industry and with regulators like we would in any MPR process. But what we're more focused on ensuring that those services from a Goldman Sachs' perspective and across the industry can get provided to clients in a safe and cost-effective way. No different than if we were to approach any of the MPRs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay. Thanks a lot.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Thanks Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Hi Matt.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the targeted customer base for the [indiscernible] platform in terms of FICO scores, income or however you're defining it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Yes. So with this launch and with this one product, we're focused on the prime borrower base.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">And I guess, how do you define prime? I mean, it's a pretty big segment overall.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So we would define it broadly for you. Let's just say above 650 FICO category.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay. And then just over time, will you provide more disclosures on this? Because as I step back and look at some of the names I cover, there seems like it could be one of the meaningful new initiatives that's out there in terms of change in the profile the company a little bit, and I think more disclosures over time will be helpful to be able to track the performance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Sure. We're happy as it grows, obviously as it becomes more meaningful, I mean just to underscore this. I got an e-mail last that we booked our first loan. So if you want to continue, if you want to consider that continuous updating of financial disclosure, Matt, but I don't mean to make a lot of your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Obviously, as it grows and becomes more meaningful, we'll spend more time with you on it. I think the important thing now is that, we make sure that everyone understands the product, the pace we expect to move at, which will be very deliberate and slow. And that in terms of return for long term, if that's kind of where you're getting, obviously, I talked a lot bit about the consumer here but we built this business to be accretive in the long run to Goldman Sachs returns. But we're certain, we're happy to keep you updated.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. And then completely unrelated, any color on the regional performance within fixed income trading this quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">No. There was nothing specific that jumped out. It was really more across the products but it wasn't anything, particularly in the regional clouds.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay, all right. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Good morning, Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Hi in the past, you've mentioned that you felt some competitors were having a more permanent retreat from the market. Did you see some of the benefit of share gains this quarter as part of your capital markets revenue? And also your comp ratio was up 100 basis points year-over-year. Are you trying to hire more people or pay more in an effort to gain share?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So with respect to the market share, certainly over the course of the past year, I would say there's been periods, particularly things like some of our core strengths, Prime Brokerage in fixed income, across the regions, we've seen discrete shifts in market share. I would say when we look at it in terms of the core businesses, for example, like credit, as we monitor those market shares, certainly with certain client segments like asset managers, it feels like we're picking up market share. Again, one of the difficult things about market share is you really need volume to grow. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And even though obviously our performance this year significantly better than last year, it's the best quarter we've had in five quarters. You really need activity levels to pick up from here. Now just in terms in the second part of your question, the 41% of this 49 is our best estimate. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">We told you forever that as a conceptual matter, you should expect in periods where revenues should decline that compensation and benefits expense should lag that and obviously, we talked to you ton about operating leverage. And so as revenues grow, you should also expect compensation and benefits expects to lag that growth because of the operating leverage. But at this stage 41% an output.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And one follow-up. Brexit, is this a chance to gain additional share? Or is this just pain that everybody has to share? And do you think more business shifts to the U.S.?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">I would say that Brexit potentially is something that could drive share to the U.S. I think what we've witnessed over the last several years is U.S. firms like ourselves with really, really strong market shares and leading business positions whether you look at FICC, investment banking, equities, asset management, if you're a leader in a franchise throughout this cycle, particularly as activity picks up, I think there is share to gain. I think our European clients need us. But in terms of Brexit, I think it's unclear whether that's having any impact at this stage. It feels like early days.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">All right, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hi good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hi Betsy, how are you?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hi good. I just had a couple of questions. Looking at the VaR that you guys put out in your note obviously in the press release. It seems like volatility actually came down a bit in certain segments and yet the VaR came down as well. And I look at this and I'm thinking is there an opportunity for you to allocate a little bit more in this environment and continue to generate some nice sized trading revenues?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So I think that observation is correct. I think what's most important about that observation is just the capacity we have under the capital ratios, so obviously. But again, VaR is going to be driven by market volatilities and by client demand. And as client demand picks up or as market volatilities pickup, certainly you would expect that to translate through. We're not feeling constrained at all really only by the macro environment and our client appetite is same.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So in this past quarter it was more function of client demand pulling back because it feels like you have the capital capacity to have had more of allocated this past quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">When you look at it in terms of so you are talking about year-over-year sequentially and you look at -- sorry, my allergies [ph] are bad today. If you look at more sequentially it's kind of mix of our total level is coming down and what I'll call position changes. If you look at year-over-year it's more about position changes. I think your big point is this environment wasn\u2019t a particularly strong environment, again it's the third quarter it's got some of the seasonal characteristics.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yes. Okay. And then just secondly on Asia, could you give us a sense as to how you guys are reorienting your Asia franchise, I noticed that there was some headcount changes over there and some management changes, so could you give us a sense as to what the strategy is for that region?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So, as you remember from the last call, we talked about the expense initiatives we launched in the first half, which translated to $700 million run rate savings. Anything you are reading in a press is a bit distorted. This process in Asia it just a continuation of the process that has been ongoing for the rest of the firm. In terms of Asia completely committed to the region. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">They make sense. I'm just saying I think there is also a comment around the Head of Asia was changing and so wondered if there was a shift in focus on?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">No, they are completely unrelated events. If you're sitting at Magic Me [ph] yesterday you would have heard Mark talked about how we joined the firm in 1976 and he just thought this would be a perfect time for him. But now they are completely unrelated in terms of there is nothing strategic in that. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">All right. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Good morning, Guy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I wanted to follow-up on the I&amp;L questions. Specifically, maybe you can just give us some color, maybe some examples, of how you have been continuing feed the equity balances to offset the gains harvesting that you have been doing over the past couple of years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Because you've harvested quite a bit, and yet you have been able to maintain that asset line item in the $21 billion, $21.5 billion range. And in the context of that, maybe you can comment on some of the recent proposals or requests that the Fed has made for congressional action to tighten up.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So in terms of I&amp;L balance sheet, again you are right to point out that $21 billion, $21.5 billion have been relatively constant. Obviously, that from a smaller component of the balance sheet I mentioned before it's close to 8% and 8% is really lending another item. And so I don\u2019t have details in front of me to give you blow-by-blow breakdowns on where reinvestments are occurring. Obviously, corporate private equity has been slow over the last couple of years, but that $21.5 million 20% of that now is made up of real estate globally. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And so that's been a meaningful participant. Now why have you generally not seen the asset class going lower? Obviously it's about high class problem. The assets have been performing, the markets have been generally going up over the last couple of years and you've seen that performance as I&amp;L segment. So that's part of the gives and gets. In terms of I think you are -- I think -- I don\u2019t think you are much talking about brokers you are talking about the fed discussions with congress, very early days and we'll see how that evolves, is that your question?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yes, I think that there was some -- there was -- before the commodities NPR came out the fed had also I think made some noises about asking for congressional guidance I guess on cutting back on merchant banking that's allowed within broker.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And I was wondering if you had some sense of whether you would be able to continue to seed that equity line and keep it in the range that it's been in or grow it if in fact there're further restrictions on merchant banking.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Well, obviously the opportunity exist, we think we are providing an important layer of capital, but these conservations evolving, it's super early, so there'd be no way for us to interpret or give you any guidance on that. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Fair enough. I guess the other question, also I&amp;L-related is, and had this has to do with the negative operating leverage comment that you had made for the Firm broadly. So for the nine months, your revenues are down; your comp is down not as much, maybe a couple of percentage points differential, which is a negative operating leverage.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">But the biggest component of the revenue decline has been I&amp;L. My question is, if I&amp;L had declined in line with the rest of the Firm, would it be possible to keep the comp declining in line as well? In other words, would you have been able to maintain your margin better if it hadn't been I&amp;L that was driving the revenue down?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So on the competition benefit expense you are right, so revenues are down 15%, you relate any competition benefit expense down 13. Now I wouldn\u2019t -- maybe we characterize that as negative operating leverage I don\u2019t know that's meaningful negative operating leverage and the reason we are able to achieve that almost lock step decline, it was because of the expense initiative we launched in the beginning of the year. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">In terms of contribution of an individual segment, we look at this as firm wide collective as we go through the competition process. And obviously competition as we repeated to you many times before, it's about performance, but it's also about managing the company for the long term and executing our strategy for the long term. So it's not going to be a -- a competition process not going to driven by one segment contribution one way or another. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate it. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Sure. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question is from the line of Fiona Swaffield with RBC. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Fiona Swaffield</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Hi.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Fiona Swaffield</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I just wanted to ask -- good morning. About pricing you mentioned -- we talked about market share, but have you seen given that some banks putting less capital to work than others, any impact on pricing in any of your products, and there is the follow-up as well on the tax rate now that is coming lower again what are you thinking about for the future? Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So in pricing at the margin it's very business specific, we have seen in some cases that I'll call a rational re-pricing and things like prime brokerage. But again in this low volume environment I don\u2019t know how much that you will see, in other words, the same low volume, low growth environment we have globally that's contributing to what it looks like in the future extraordinarily strong competitive environment for our businesses is the same thing that doesn\u2019t allow for lot of price improvements.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And so I think these one of your things where even though it has taken while you need environment that is challenge for a while or to get competitors retreats of the same challenges don\u2019t allow for price adjustments, it maybe overtime you see price adjustments, but certainly things the more capital intensive parts of the business like prime brokerage where we are market leader. In terms of tax I think in terms of your estimate obviously it will be driven by regional contributions, but I would say 28% to 29% that range. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Fiona Swaffield</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question from the line of Jim Mitchell with The Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Hey Jim. How are you?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Good. How are you doing, Harvey?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Good.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Maybe just a question on Asia I guess in a more positive way, you have the Hong Kong, Shanghai connect going into place later this year, it seems like when the Hong Kong Shanghai connect went in you guys had a nice boost in equity trading the industry did in the first half of 2015. Do you expect something similar this time around?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I don\u2019t know, necessarily we have a strong view in terms of the immediate. I do think that over the intermediate term it's an important development. I think more broadly, well it might not be a straight path to increasing volumes, I think more broadly in Asia our perspective is and with China that we are on a long upward trajectory of activity and our role and ability to work with clients in the region, whether its trading, advisory, capital raising, this just feels like a very long positive trajectory, but it\u2019s not going to be straight line.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Right okay. Fair enough. And then maybe a follow-up on the pipeline. You guys did note you're down year-over-year. Is that mostly M&amp;A and can you give any more color on what you're seeing in terms of the outlook on the pipeline?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So the pipeline feels pretty good when you talk our M&amp;A team. And the backlog sequentially was up, not down. But the activity levels that I mentioned in terms of completed transactions in the market, obviously down over year after very, very healthy levels.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">The best perspective I can share with you is the one I get from talking to our M&amp;A bankers. And it hasn\u2019t shifted much over the course of the year. The same fundamental factors that are contributing to the last two years of M&amp;A activity, generally low topline growth, a desire to drive efficiencies, access to the capital markets, all those factors still in place.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Now regionally the U.S. field is more active then Europe and Asia fields a bit more active than Europe, but I am giving you really very localized commentary. Long-term it feels like the fundamental factors are in place.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And the underwriting side of the equation?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So in underwriting as you saw, we've had very strong debt performance and we had a record for the first nine months of this year on a year-to-date basis. I mentioned before that half year IPO volume or meaningful portion of the IPO volume actually occurred in September.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So it does feel like we are starting now again into a market where a lot of that activity that got pushed from the first quarter into the second quarter that that still exists. So we feel reasonably good about activity levels in the capital markets on an intermediate basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. Great. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question is from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Chris Kotowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes, I wonder if you could give us some more color on the new private equity fund? I saw a press report saying it's between $5 billion and $8 billion. But if you could just comment on the targeted size and mandate? Is it global or North American? Is it pure corporate equity, or is it broader? And then as a follow-on to that, if it's $5 billion to $8 billion, the Blackstones and Apollos of the world are raising $18 billion-plus. So what's the strategy to put the money to work? Is it to go more middle market? To do fewer deals or to bring in more co-investors? Those kind of my questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">No I am happy to talk about it. I don't know if I'll get to all of your questions, but let me just give you the high level. So we are in the market, there is really two fundamental reasons why we decided to engage in the fund raise. One was really to have a full offering for our private wealth clients.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And the second is if you look at the capital regime particular under CCARs as it related to private equity, corporate equity specifically, those capital requirements continue to adjust. So they are giving us the flexibility to utilize the funds and to provide that to our clients. It seem like it made a ton of sense.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Now in terms of the fund size, we have been talking about $5 billion to $8 billion, that\u2019s what the team feels is the right size for the horizon that they are thinking about. So they are not looking the raise the largest one of the world despite the fact that there\u2019s been very significant interest in terms of how we are approaching it and in terms of its focus, its focus will be on corporate private equity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Chris Kotowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. And should we assume that you will commit 3% to it? And is it the standard asset management 1% and 20%? And I assume that these will show up on the asset management side? And then kind of related to that, is this all a wealth management, asset management, standalone business that's walled off from investment banking? Or can there be cross-pollination between the two?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Well the activities, the activities allow for us obviously to work with our investment bankers, but it is an asset management driven product and its broker compliance, in its design.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Chris Kotowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. All right. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Good morning. So first question on non-comp. I think you took a charge here in occupancy. Is there some benefit that we should see flowing through in subsequent quarters from that occupancy charge this quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes. So we took a $63 million charge. This relates to one asset that we leased out. The run rate on that is small, but generally speaking, we look at these things, we look for a reasonably short term in terms of payback, in terms of recouping those expenses but this has been something we were just waiting for the market to recover, but it's a small item.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. And then, hoping to ask a follow-up for your previous comments on FICC. I think you commented that the quarter wasn't a particularly strong one, even though the year-over-year growth was good. And it seemed like you commented that you are gaining share in FICC, at least among some market participants.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">But if we look at year-to-date trends in revenue, it does look like some of the U.S. money center banks are growing double digit plus over 2015 year to date, whereas Goldman's revenue is down. Can you help us understand maybe why that's diverging? Is it a business mix issue? Is there something else going on? Are you shifting away from certain clients or what have you? Any help you could give us there, Harvey, would be great.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes. It's no problem. I think that's more environment-specific. So it could be in some aspects, different footprint. All these businesses at this stage in FICC, and we don't have much visibility in FICC competitors, they're all very different. Some of these are enormous balance sheets. Some of them are very big in emerging markets, some are not.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I think when you look at it I wouldn't overemphasize the first quarter '15, which I think is really the factor that's influencing your math. And again I wouldn't overemphasize the performance that we had in the third quarter either, because things just don't shift that quickly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I think that the third quarter was solid for us. But as I talked about currencies, commodities was down year-over-year. So it certainly wasn't an environment we were hitting on all cylinders and even with that, we were in a double-digit ROE environment. So it feels pretty good to us and the momentum feels good.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Hey Harvey, Wanted to start off with just a follow-up question relating to the earlier merchant banking discussion. Recognize that many of the recommendations are, in fact just that, that have come from the regulators. But just thinking about the strategy for this business, longer term, looking at the activities more broadly, it's been a very good profit source, historically, but it also consumes significant amounts of capital.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And under a CCAR lens, some have speculated it could even be ROE dilutive overall. I was wondering, given the current backdrop and some of the high-end regulatory scrutiny, whether you have considered strategic alternatives for the business, such as an IPO or a spin that could generate value while maybe allowing for some degree of regulatory unshackling?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So I think you're right to underscore, which I mentioned earlier, the fact that over time, the CCAR requirements under -- let's just use private equity investing and corporate equity have certainly increased. Now the nice thing about that analytic framework is it's perfectly transparent with the global market shops are etcetera. So you can certainly evaluate investments that you're making.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Now we're talking about investments at the bottom part of the capital structure and so in terms of the return profile, we're obviously very selective about how we deploy that capital. But as I mentioned before, one of the nice things about launching this fund is it does gives us flexibility in terms of how to think about deploying that capital and it creates a new important product for our clients. So we have options.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Got it. Okay. That's very helpful color, Harvey. Thank you and maybe just one follow-up on the capital side. Actually, we're shifting over to the denominator. It is quite evident that you have made significant strides in mitigating your standardized RWAs. I think it's down about 15% since the end of 2014. But the advanced risk rated assets have actually crept higher.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I know some of that is going to be a function of increases in op risk. But I was hoping you could speak to any mitigation potential that you can achieve on the advanced risk rated assets moving forward, particularly if the Collins floor does end up applying to some of the new proposed capital changes that Tarullo spoke to in his recent remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes. So as I mentioned on the advanced transitional, we're at 12.4% under the current capital regime. Obviously, that gives us more than enough capacity. We obviously have things that roll off and things like that, but not material enough for me to highlight for you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">But to the extent to which I think at this stage whether you look at the supplementary leverage ratio, standardized, advanced, we have the tools in place through our return on attributed equity framework, the ROE framework, which we talked a lot about.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">We have the tools in place at this stage and more importantly, the culture, the people engagement across the entire firm. We will adapt if needed but right now we feel we have more than enough capacity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Got it. Thanks for taking my questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Sure. Steve.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question is from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Good morning Harvey. Thanks for taking my question. Just a couple of quick ones. You mentioned that there was the strongest inflow of AUM in the quarter was in fixed income. Any color as to what was driving that and if those were -- was that all liquidity or was it slightly higher margin flow?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">No. So liquidity products, I believe, it's up $2 billion in the quarter. So this was long-term fee-based assets that were really the driver. And the team has done a very good job in their advisory businesses and so that I would say would be the more meaningful part of the driver in terms of this quarter's flows.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay, and just circling back to another question previously asked. If I back out the charge that you took in occupancy this quarter, it looks like, as well as litigation, it looks like you are running in the last couple of quarters at around 24%, 25% non-comp to revenue ratio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I understand revenue can be a bit volatile, but it's been trending prior to that at 30%-plus. Is 25% a new run rate? Or is it really going to depend -- should we really think more about the dollar value rather than the ratio?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">We don't target a ratio. You should think of the ratio as an output. Now obviously, we have been very diligent around expenses over the last couple of years reflecting the environment. If you happen to have a lot of historical financials, you would see that market development this quarter was under $100 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I think it's the lowest it's been in seven years. So obviously we've been very focused on this, but we don't target a ratio. And a big driver obviously is BC&amp;E and if you saw big activity pickup, that would move with the environment as well. But we're very focused on expenses as you know.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yes, thanks very much. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question is from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Thanks very much. Hi, how are you Harvey? Just to step back for a moment, can we just talk about how we should contemplate revenue growth across the mix of businesses more broadly? Because I look at what happened this quarter and what's occurred over the course of the year. And in the underwriting businesses and in the advisory business, obviously you know the statistics much better than I. But advisory may be moving to a new, lower plateau than what we've seen recently. And with all the cross currents running through the trading environment and through the investing environment, how do we contemplate the overall go-forward mix of business?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So I think we don't target the mix, as you know. We focus on the clients in those businesses where, as you know, we have leading market positions and so we feel good about that. I think it's a bit more of what's your expectation for the environment is.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">We control the micro issues we can focus on, our client engagement, expenses, capital management. But a lot of the things are outside of our control and I would say that in aggregate, when you look at the vast majority of our businesses, this is not an extraordinary environment, despite the fact that third quarter performance was strong on a relative basis, there's lots of challenges regionally.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">You could certainly envision an environment that was significantly better from where we are today. You've heard us say this a lot, but we look for growth and an environment of negative interest rates in vast parts of the world is not indicative of a role that's growing at great pace. So you could see much better environments than we have today, and we hope that ends up being the case.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">But just from a planning perspective, I mean is there any reason to think that, or that this environment, that those policy dynamics are changing over, let's say, a medium-term horizon?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Just like I think they could change always pretty quickly for a negative, and we tend to be more contingency planners. You could certainly see things break for the high side. Obviously, rates could move back into positive territory, which should be an indicator and there's been speculation in the market that we might be more in the cusp of that in the United States.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I think the most important takeaway is whether or not we move into that environment in the near term? We're incorporating all those current factors in how we're running the firm today, which in a pretty muted environment, we're able to grow revenues, demonstrate a double-digit ROE and we truly believe we're well positioned in the franchise with significant operating leverage if the environment improves. So we feel quite good about our position, but we are rooting for a better environment for everybody.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And if I could sneak in one last one on Marcus. Most firms that do similar kind of lending typically have a 2.5% to 3% pre-tax ROA. How does that compare with what it is you are targeting?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So that's perfectly consistent with what we're able to generate. Of course, we don't have any legacy infrastructure cost structure. This is all white sheet of paper for us. So we'll see how it evolves, but that's certainly achievable.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. Thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin Ryan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Thanks, good morning, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Hi how are you, Devin?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin Ryan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Good. So it seems like we are speaking a lot more about your technology footprint on these calls. And you have been increasingly highlighting a number of those capabilities. When we look at those initiatives, like Marcus or Symphony, Marquee, or consolidating the electronic trading book across businesses, and maybe I missed something there, but where do you see the most immediate opportunities to actually move the needle?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And I guess that's part one. Part two is as you think about future investments in the technology, do you think more of the incremental spend from here is going to be more offensive positioning, revenue-producing, rather than defensive?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So it's a great question. I would say that broadly speaking, and this won't be completely inclusive, but I think you can define our technology strategy as focused on client engagement and those tools and services we can deliver to clients that provide differentiated value to those clients, and you see that doing us in our capital markets businesses and obviously you see us creating that with Marcus.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Two, there are times when we feel like given our core technology skills, we're in a position to develop technology, which will be better enhance outside of the firm ultimately even though we incubated it in the firm, and Symphony will be a great example of that. We feel like as an information sharing platform with better security, better compliance controls, we felt like that was something better utilized by a broad range of market participants.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And lastly, our own technology internally is quite important for making us more efficient and adapting to regulatory change and managing our risks, and that's obviously been very core to what we do. So we look across all three of those different platforms if you will, for lack of better language.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I would say the most important thing in addition to controlling the firm is our client engagement and Marcus reflects that trend as it relates to consumers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin Ryan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Got it, that's great. Very helpful. Maybe just a quick follow-up. Just any update on the momentum in deposit gathering within the online bank? Just how that has been, I don't know if you give any numbers there, but how that's been maybe relative to expectations now that we are a little ways away from the launch?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So it's more than exceeded our expectations. I think in the past quarter, we picked up another $1 billion of deposits and so the momentum there feels quite good and the team's done an excellent job of transitioning the platform into Goldman.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin Ryan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Got it, okay. Thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Hey Brian.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Hi Harvey, actually I'm all good. All my questions were asked. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. Great. Thanks, Brian.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And your next question is from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thanks. Going back to the comp ratio, and what you said earlier about as revenues go higher, the comp ratios should really drift lower. As we are having lower revenues this year, the comp ratios should probably drift a little bit higher than it was last year. Is that the concept you were really pushing forward earlier?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So this is completely consistent, Marty. As you know, you've been following us forever in terms of broadly speaking and it may not be the case in any given year. But broadly speaking, we've encouraged you to expect that compensation and benefits expense will lag revenue moves.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So you've seen it through the first -- through the year-to-date. 41% is our best estimate but revenues are down 15%; compensation and benefits expense, down 13%. In environments where revenues are up, base case, you should expect a lag in that direction also particularly given how much we've emphasized operating leverage with you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">That is what I thought. I've just been spoiled the last two year with revenues being fairly consistent on a year-on-year basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">The other thing I was going to ask was, you had mentioned you had four businesses, which is outlined on income statement very clearly. When you talk about the new consumer business and lending, it really doesn't fit into any of those four. Do you feel like you could put deposits maybe in asset management? But are you thinking about this as evolving into a fifth business? Or how would you tuck it into your overall strategic mix today?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So three of the four segments are up this year obviously. The one segment, which we worked hard to unpack for everybody is Investing &amp; Lending and this would very naturally fall into the lending segment. Obviously, to the extent to which down the road as an activity in and of itself, if it had material contribution, we could talk about highlighting more, but I think it will give a lot of attention as it grows anyway, it's pretty exciting.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Marty Mosby</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Got you. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thanks Marty.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So since there are no more questions, I just really want to take a moment to thank all of you for joining the call. Hopefully, I and other members of senior management will see many of you in the coming months.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">If any additional questions come up, please don't hesitate to reach out to Dane or the team. Otherwise, please enjoy the rest of your day and I look forward to speaking with you on our fourth quarter earnings call in January. Take care, everyone, and thanks again.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs third quarter 2016 earnings conference call.

My name is Dennis, and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today, January 18<sup>th</sup>, 2017.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you. Mr. Holmes, you may begin your conference.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Dane Holmes</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. And welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm's belief regarding future events that, by their nature are uncertain and outside of the firm's control. The firm's actual results and financial condition may differ possibly materially from what is indicated in these forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm's future results, please see the description of Risk Factors in our current annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, global core liquid assets and supplementary leverage ratio and you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that is posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">This audio cast is copyrighted material to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">I'll now pass the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Harvey Schwartz, who is also joined by our Deputy CFO, Marty Chavez. Harvey?</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thanks Dane and thanks to everyone for dialing in. As many of you are aware, Marty will be assuming my position in April. As you would expect, we\u2019re already working side by side to ensure a smooth transition in the coming months.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Over his career, Mary held positions of increasing responsibility in investment banking, institutional client services and then most recently as our Chief Information Officer. During that time, Marty established a track record of creating tremendous value for both our clients and our firm. Having worked closely with him for over a decade, I have full confidence that Marty will continue that track record as our Chief Financial Officer.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">With that Marty would like to make a few comments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Martin Chavez</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thanks Harvey. Just a few brief words from me. I have really enjoyed the opportunity to meet many of you in my prior role as CIO. I look forward to building upon existing relationships and building new ones in the months and years ahead. I have always found our conversations to be extremely insightful and valuable to effectively managing our firm. Goldman Sachs has a long tradition vigilantly focusing on risk management, operational excellence and maintaining a conservative financial profile. In my new role, I have every intention of continuing that focus and tradition.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">With that I will turn it back to Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Thanks Marty. Okay, now let\u2019s walk through the fourth quarter and full year results then Marty and I are happy to answer any questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Briefly on the fourth quarter; net revenues were $8.2 billion, net earnings were $2.3 billion, earnings per diluted share were $5.08 and annualized return on common equity was 11.4%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">With respect to our annual results, we had firm-wide net revenues of $30.6 billion, net earnings of $7.4 billion, earnings per diluted share of $16.29 and a return on common equity of 9.4%. We grew book value per share by 6.7% year-over-year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">When reviewing 2016, it\u2019s helpful to contrast the performance between the first half of the year and the second half. The year began with a number of challenges but ultimately ended with a lot of positive momentum.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">For example, the start of the year which has historically been a period of high activity, which instead impacted by significant concerns regarding the economic outlook, equity markets posted substantial declines and credit spreads wide and materially at the start of the year. This combination of factors translated into a difficult operating environment for our clients and by extension for our firm.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In the second quarter concerns regarding global economic growth moderated but other concerns including the potential implications of the Brexit vote surface. Ultimately, net revenues in the first half of the year declined by 28% year-over-year with a vast majority of that declining occurring in the first quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Switching to the back half of the year, the global economic outlook improved reflecting solid economic reports particularly in the U.S. The prospect of diverging monitory policy and more pro-growth policies in the United States drove both activity levels and asset prices higher.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">For example various fixed income market volumes in the second half of 2016 rose double digits year-over-year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">U.S. investment grade credit spreads tightened by nearly 40 basis points. U.S. high yield spreads tightened by over 150 basis points. And the MSCI World index climbs 6% during the period.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Ultimately this drove improved client sentiment and better environments. As a result, net revenues in the back half of the 2016 increased by nearly 16% year-over-year and included two consecutive quarter of 11 plus percent returns on equity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In short, we ended the year with positive momentum and a significantly improved operating environment. With that as a back ground, let\u2019s discuss the individual business using greater detail.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">As it relates to the quarter, investment banking produced net revenues $1.5 billion, 3% lower than the third quarter. A pick up in M&amp;A was more than offset by a decline in underwriting. For the full year investment banking net revenues were $6.3 billion, down a 11% from 2015 and a decrease in equity underwriting and financial advisory revenues, which was partially by record debt underwriting revenues of $2.5 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Our franchise remains very well positioned. We ended the year as a leader in global announced and completed M&amp;A and as a leading equity and debt underwriter globally.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Breaking down the components of investment banking in the fourth quarter, advisory revenues were $709 million. The 8% improvement relative to the third quarter reflects an increase in a number of completed M&amp;A transactions. We advise on a number of significant transactions that closed during the fourth quarter including Procter &amp; Gamble, $12.5 billion merger with beauty business into Coty. Fortis Inc\u2019s $11.8 billion acquisition of ITC Holdings Corp. And Rackspace Hosting\u2019s $4.3 billion sales were of Apollo.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We also advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the fourth quarter including Qualcomm\u2019s $47 billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors, B/E Aerospace\u2019s $8.3 billion sales for Rockwell Collins and Capsugel\u2019s $5.5 billion sales for Lonza Group.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Moving to underwriting, net revenues were $777 million in the fourth quarter down 12% sequentially as debt and equity issuance slowed. Equity underwriting net revenues up $212 million were down 7% compared to the third quarter as follow-on offerings decreased.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Debt underwriting net revenues decreased 13% to $565 million from robust issuance levels in the third quarter. During the fourth quarter, we actively supported our clients' financing needs, participating in energies \u20ac4.6 billion IPO to Soros $1.6 billion high yield bond offering and it seems [indiscernible] $1.2 billion IPO. Our investment banking backlog improved from the third quarter, it was lower compared with very strong level at the end of 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our FICC and equities businesses, net revenues were $3.6 billion in the fourth quarter down slightly compared to the third quarter. For the full year $14.5 billion of net revenues were down modestly compared to 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">FICC client execution net revenues were $2 billion in the fourth quarter, up slightly quarter-over-quarter as many businesses benefited from increased client activity. This more than offset typical year end seasonality.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Commodities increased significantly during the quarter as higher energy prices drove better market making conditions and more client activity. Currencies were higher compared to the third quarter increasing client activity. Rates were down slightly relative to the third quarter, client activity was solid driven by diverging monetary policies. Credit and mortgages decreased in an environment that included lesser issuance and generally tighter spreads.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">For the full year, FICC client execution net revenues were $7.6 billion. This translated into a 6% increase year-over-year excluding DVA gains from 2015 results, given the difficult market conditions in the first quarter of 2016, 6% growth particularly notable. In equities, which include equities client execution, commissions and fees and security services, net revenues for the fourth quarter were $1.6 billion down 11% sequentially. Equities client execution net revenues were $459 million, down significantly across both derivatives and cash products.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Commissions and fees were $736 million, up slightly relative to the third quarter as global client volumes increased modestly. Security services generated net revenues of $398 million, up modestly on a sequential basis</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">For the full year, equities produce net revenues of $6.9 billion down 12% year-over-year. In 2016, we were impacted by less favorable market conditions and lower client activity and equities client execution. This compared to a relatively robust performance in the first half of 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to risk, average daily VaR in the fourth quarter was $61 million up from $57 million in the third quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Moving on to our investing and lending activities, collectively these businesses produced net revenues of $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter. Equity security generated net revenues of $1 billion, reflecting corporate performance as well as sales and gains in public equity investments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $457 million which was largely driven by net interest income of roughly $300 million. For the full year, investing and lending generated net revenues of $4.1 billion driven by $2.6 billion in gains from equity securities and $1.5 billion of net revenues from debt securities and loans. Our net interest income within debt securities was more than $1 billion for the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In investment management, we reported fourth quarter net revenues of $1.6 billion. This is up 8% from the third quarter primarily as a result of $224 million in incentive fees largely from alternative investment products. For 2016, investment management net revenues were $5.8 billion, down 7% year-over-year largely due to lower incentive fees. For the fourth quarter assets under supervision finished at a record $1.38 trillion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">The $32 billion increase versus the third quarter was driven by $17 billion of long term net inflows, $31 billion of net inflows into liquidity products, partially offset by $16 billion of market depreciation. On a full year basis, we had $42 billion of long term net inflows primarily driven by fixed income and $52 billion of liquidity product inflows.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as benefits was down 8% for 2016 reflecting the decline in net revenues. This translated into compensation in net revenues ratio of 38.1%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Fourth quarter non-competition expenses were $2.3 billion. The quarter included a $114 million donation to Goldman Sachs gives our donor advised charitable fund. For the full year non-compensation expenses were down significantly due to a decrease in provisions for litigation and regulatory matters. Excluding litigation provisions, non-competition expenses would have been down slightly year-over-year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Now I'd like to take you through a few key statistics for the end of the year. Total staff was approximately 34,400, down slightly from the third quarter. Our effective tax rate for the year was 28.2%. Our global core liquid asset ended the fourth quarter at $226 billion and our balance sheet was $862 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.5% using the standardized approach. It was 13.1% under the Basel III Advanced approach. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 6.4%. Our prudent approach to capital management is demonstrated by the strength of our capital ratios and had supported our return of excess capital to shareholders. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 7.6 million shares of common stock for $1.5 billion. For the full year, we repurchased $6.1 billion at an average purchase price of roughly $166 per share.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As a result, we reduced our basic share count by approximately 27 million shares for the year reaching a new record low. In addition, we paid out approximately $1.1 billion dollars of common dividends over the course of the year. In total, we returned $7.2 billion of capital to shareholders in 2016.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Before taking questions, a few closing thoughts. As we've said many times before, we have a healthy respect for the dynamic nature of our industry and we have an established track record of being responsive to changes in operating environment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As we discussed, the first half of 2016 was challenging. In response, we undertook and completed a $700 million expense initiative in the first half of the year. We continued those efforts in the second half of the year and ultimately generated nearly $900 million of run rate savings. When undertaking any expense initiative all about finding the right balance, you want to protect near term results without impacting long term prospects.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We believe we found the right balance in 2016. This can be seen in our ability to effectively serve our clients as activity picked up in the second half of the year. It also reflected in our continued investment in technology and infrastructure including our launch of Marcus.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Most importantly our expense discipline and the strength of our client relationships leaves as well positioned to deliver significant operating leverage to our shareholders in a better operating environment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In summary, we entered 2017 from a position of strength. We have a robust financial profile ending the year with $226 billion in liquidity more than a quarter of our balance sheet. All of our risk based capital ratios are well in excess of regulatory requirements well our share count sits at a record low. Importantly, this means we have the flexibility to navigate shifts in the operating environment including the positive scenario where we experienced a significant increase in client activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Finally, our global franchise remains as strong as ever reflecting our commitment and investment to serve our clients. Meeting their core objectives, we\u2019ll continue to be the basis for our long term success.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Thank you again for dialing in. Marty and I are happy to answer your questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p5\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Hi thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Hey good morning, Glenn.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Good morning. So I have a fixed income related question. Back in the first quarter of 2015, the Swiss re-pegged and things went bonkers for a couple weeks and you guys made a ton more money but then things die down for like six quarters. This quarter, we obviously had the election and a couple other events and things went bonkers, but it feels very different to me and more permanent and client needs are changing and we have monetary policy diversion, so I'm leaving the witness here, but does it feel different to you guys and does that equate to this could be the first year in many that the fixed income fee pull could grow?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Yeah you know it's a great question. I mean the quarter you're reflecting on obviously the first quarter of 2015 very strong quarter for us, we had nearly a 15% ROE. That was the quarter as you point out, there were monetary policy announcements and I think there was a little bit of a relief activity there because that was viewed as increased monetary policy QE and that was a trend now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">As we all saw over a period of time that ultimately led more to concerns about lackluster growth and it led to concerns about deflation and then it led to concerns ultimately that actually QE policies at the limit may not be effective and may actually present risks. I would say you could look at our fourth quarter, but I think it\u2019d be better to look really at the second half of the year and what we saw from clients in the second half of the year was basically a build of confidence and expectation that we might see stronger fiscal policy, divergence of interest rates that we weren't heading into a deflationary cycle more confidence about economic growth, and so I would say there was increased optimism around the world.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Now those are the kind of things that always drive our business, our clients are very sensitive to that it changes sentiment. So I would say that that felt more like a trend across the past six months of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Okay, maybe some of yours ex-colleagues consensus more tweets and increased activity levels, kidding. Let last question on INL. I - we got - it's good to have that reprieve in terms of the INL funded divestments. I'm curious if it changes at all how you approach the way we asked you every quarter about what's left in equity, what do you need to divest, and that whole game plan I\u2019m curious on your thoughts there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">No, so I\u2019m happy to walk you through it. So I mean in order flow I walk you through every quarter, longer cover fund $106.7 billion you take out an amount that confirms that's $200 million that leaves you with $6.5 billion. Of the $6.5 billion, $1.8 billion of that is inner fund but those entities are already public, they're trading publicly on exchanges. So they are already liquid, they are just in a process of being sold down. So now with respect to Volcker as was more that's expected by the marketplace because you remember under the original construct of Volcker, it was never designed to force sales, it was obviously very encouraging of compliance. So there was an expectation everyone would do what they could save to comply. But again there was no there's no desire for fire sales and so the expectation here is that we've now submitted for the extensions, we'll go through the extension process, but we've been a good say that during if you read their communication, you expect extensions to be approved broadly across the industry.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">For us, it hasn't changed the approach of the business. It's always been about ensuring that we provide the best returns for our clients because as you know, we're invested alongside our clients in these funds. Apply more than you wanted, but I just try to cover the whole thing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">I appreciated, thank you. Go ahead we can go on to the next person. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">All right, thanks Glenn.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">The next question is from line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Good morning, Harvey. And then welcome on board Marty. So hate to nit-pick in a strong quarter, but performance in equities was noticeably weaker than peers. I\u2019m curious if there were any onetime items in the quarter or anything that you think drove underperformance, and then maybe more broadly if you could update us on how you're feeling about the competitive position in that business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So look I think you're right to point out it wasn't our strongest quarter. I mean in terms of the franchise, we feel great about the franchise at this stage and certainly we feel quite good about the competitive dynamic. No matter how you look at the business, whether you look at it as our global footprint, prime services, our ability to make capital our position underwriting, we feel incredibly good about it. Quarter-to-quarter there were always going to be one offs, there are a handful of things that we\u2019re less than probably this quarter, but I wouldn't read anything into it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay. And then as soon as your last one, I'll give you a pretty one accounting question here, but the accounting standards for the tax impact of shared based compensation, I believe this schedule to change this year. I'm giving share based comp is a meaningful part of the income statement curious if that has any impact on your kind of forward the way your incomes may looks going forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Yeah, so it's a very detailed question. It's great that you're asking it actually. So as everyone not might not be as aware as you are Christian but under a gap change, basically the change requires us to recognize the tax impact of the difference and the value of shares that we grant which a grant date versus delivery date and our tax expense line on the income statements. Now prior to the change that would happen and shows equity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So there is two observations here, so at best we can estimate it today, it could be in a range of $400 million, $500 million in terms of a reduction in the tax rates, but this is just a geographic realignment under gap, this has no impact to capital where the strength of our capital, but you will see a shift in the recognition. And obviously anyone can feel free to follow up more with Dane if you really want to get into the details of the gap stuff.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay, it's very helpful. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Mike, you there? Michael, you there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Michael, check your line to see if you\u2019re on mute. One moment. Michael, are you there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Yeah, can you hear me?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Yeah, we can hear you now Michael, but we couldn\u2019t hear you before, so the asked question we didn\u2019t get it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay, no problem. Thanks a lot. First one just on expenses, so you guys have been doing a very good job on controlling the expenses and we saw the operating leverage in the quarter. Just wanted to get a sense depending on what potential changes happened with policy and regulation, is there some way to give us some context on the amount that has been spent whether it's on regulation, compliance, technology it maybe since 2011, 2012 that could either shift around depending on the outlook, obviously there\u2019s a lot of core and that\u2019s going to stay in place, but just wanted to get a sense on what that increase has been despite you guys imaging the overall expense base well?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Yeah. Difficult to quantify that for you obviously it's been a huge investment in terms of risk, technology, compliance and we continue invest. I think the thing that we've been able to do is as we've invested and as we\u2019ve comply with the rules, we never be use technology and training across the teams to be as efficient as possible which is why this year you would have seen that non-compensation expense was the lowest expense since 2007 and we were able to also execute the $900 million run rate savings, but who knows where we\u2019ll end up in terms of the rule set, but obviously we\u2019ll always look to comply and comply in the most efficient way possible over time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay, and then just as a follow-up. It's been a while since we've been in an environment or people may more positive on like the growth outlook, and just wanted to get a sense and this is somewhat Glenn's question and you answer it, but maybe broader on trading and banking. What do you guys look at in terms of seeing that pick up in client engagement, I know you mentioned the IB pipeline is up quarter-over-quarter but even on trading in terms of balances, investment management maybe inflows, just wanted to get some sense on how we can kind of see the follow through or the impact of better economy in that translating into in a stronger revenues?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Yeah, that\u2019s a great question. Look the thing that informs us the most is the work that all of our people do whether they are in banking, asset management, whether they are in equities or fixed income all around the globe engage with their clients every day. So these are relationship that build up over decades, they are invested in over decades, you know our teams of sitting with CEOs, they are sitting in board rooms. And the best way for us to get a pause on that globally is the feedback we get from clients every day.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And as you know over the past several years there\u2019s been a general sense of concern with respect to global growth that was reinforced by a lot of the monitory policy around the world. And so I would say as we come into 2017, activity levels are quite high. You know we can\u2019t - we\u2019ve come out of a very low volume, low volatility environment for a number of years. We\u2019re happy to see how this year progresses. But with the shipping policies around the globe, it\u2019s an extraordinary catalyst for client dialog, for decision making and for content and that\u2019s really where as a firm that\u2019s where we really want to drive value and drive value with content.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay, thanks a lot.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Good morning. Just give us some of the increased optimism that you\u2019ve talked about on this call and the pipelines, just kind of big picture, how do you think differently about staffs, call it how much you lean forward versus trying to optimize, it\u2019s like a last several years you and the industry have been focused on optimizing to kind of lower pool of revenues got for regulatory environment. And just how do you think about you know it\u2019s not going to be a complete 180 going to maybe been aggressive, but how do you think maybe about leaning forward a little bit more, whereas the too loaded think that way?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Yeah. So look, this is all - this is all just about balance. So we are in a cyclical business within a pro-cyclical industry. And so as we make decisions about investing and controlling expenses, you know these things are mutually exclusive. So if you just look at the past year, obviously we responded very quickly to the tough first quarter. As I mentioned we finished with $900 million of run rate savings completed in the year. But at the same time, we never stop hiring. We launched Marcus. We acquired the digital lending platform. And so we stayed very front footed and we feel well positioned.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Now to the extent to which there were more demands on the firm by creating efficiencies to this part of the cycle, it gives us the flexibility to invest in an improved part of the cycle. That\u2019s the best thing about having capital ratios as strong as our capital ratios are right now are having liquidity levels where they are because to extent to which there is demand, we can respond to it. So you can be well positioned and you can be efficient at the same time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O'Connor</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay, thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thanks Matt.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hi.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hey, good morning, Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">This is the first change since the announcement about Gary Cohn, so you know Harvey, how do you kind of approach your new position and then for Marty, how does your past experience you know help you or maybe present a challenge for you in the CFO role going from CIO to CFO is somewhat unique?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Right so - well obviously we\u2019re all going to miss Gary. It\u2019s fantastic that he is willing to contribute all of his experience to a country and it\u2019s a long tradition of senior leaders that Goldman Sachs doing that. So we\u2019re - again we\u2019re all going to miss Gary but we\u2019re all quite proud on what he is decided to do.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">In terms of the transition in my role, I\u2019ve obviously been CFO for a bit over four years. You David Solomon and I, we\u2019ve been on management for years. We found the same floor for years and you know which have affinities based on our experience. David spent more time in investment banking. I\u2019ve spent more time in institutional client services. But I think it lays out pretty easily actually in terms of how he and I will work across the firm. It\u2019s big place with lots of clients. So we\u2019re both pretty excited about it. And that transition is already underway.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">In terms of the transition with Marty, we\u2019ve already been working side by side. Marty has been shadowing me for a couple of weeks and then he is working on his transition. For those you met Marty, I don\u2019t know he about 150 pounds less than I am. So following my shadows sounds like a strange thing. But that\u2019s how we are approaching. And we got - and look we have a deep bench Mike, so we\u2019ve done these things across the firm for years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And can we hare - I mean Mary you are ready to talk?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Chavez</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Sure Mike. I\u2019ll just add, going to continue to firm\u2019s traditions and risk management and maintaining funding profile fortune to inherent such a talented team. And in keeping with the times and industry, applied maths and software to these problems or risk management but continue to do, we\u2019ve always done.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And just one last follow-up for you Marty, so coming from CIO, is that what it\u2019s about applying maths and software and how else can you apply your part experience to the new role?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Chavez</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Well, there is maths and software and everything that we do and so that\u2019s just a perspective - particular prospectively but really it\u2019s risk management. And that\u2019s what I\u2019ll keep doing as I\u2019ve always done, been let the firm for a long time, worked in many of our businesses always with an emphasis on risk.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Alright, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Chavez</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Thanks Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hi, good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hey, good morning, Betsy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I wanted to ask a little bit about for productivity inset, we\u2019ve had conversations in the past where when we are in a world or at least what we\u2019ve discussed is in a rising rate with an established trend you know upside rate environment. In the past you\u2019ve had improving our productivity and I am wondering how you think about that, at this stage do you feel like you\u2019ve captured what you think you would capture overtime you know step function 4Q versus 3Q or is there more to go here?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Well I think it\u2019s difficult to me forecast. I would say the following I think if rates continue to rise and it\u2019s a reflection of optimism and concerns around deflation abate and concerns around economic decline debate and they are replaced with expectations of economic growth and activity and confidence and client sentiment continues to shift. I think there is meaningful upside in terms of the activity levels we could see in fixed income. So we\u2019ve been pretty optimistic now. We\u2019re positioned for a number of scenarios obviously given all the steps we\u2019ve taken over the years. And whether it\u2019s risk or capital, obviously we have a lot of capacity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And then secondly on INL, in the equity\u2019s line even I saw 2Q, 1Q obviously the market overall was up a little bit, certain factors up significantly and I had thought that your focus in many of the activities you have is a bit more of an industrial versus a services angle. So I am wondering if there is some - could you give us some color as to on the INL equity side how much of that was realized versus just a mark and what you still have left in the bag for realizations going forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yeah, so one thing I really want to point out because I know this question comes up about realizing and better you ask it but everybody asked it realize versus mark. The most important thing is the portfolio was always mark-to-market. So I think what you mean by realize is monetization activity. Obviously in the past year, monetization activity wouldn\u2019t have been as high necessarily as in prior years. We don\u2019t talk to it that way as much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">You know the INO balance sheet, you didn\u2019t ask it but the INO balance sheet is roughly $98 billion and nearly 80% of it is lending related activity. And so it\u2019s $21 billion what we call equity. But it\u2019s idiosyncratic and what you generally see over a period of time is a portfolio has outperformed markets because of the quality of the investment professionals and asset selections. But I wouldn\u2019t say necessarily that it\u2019s one category or another. I think you are right to say that obviously industrials are representative but it\u2019s very idiosyncratic and a year like this where equity issuance is down. You wouldn\u2019t expect to see lots of monetization.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. And then last on fees and asset management you know across the industry been some chatter on see pressure seeing some industry leaders cut season more of the passive oriented products but maybe you could just give us a senses to how you are thinking about that business and managing it for the several years?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So I think as a management for us among other things also a bright spot. As you saw assets under supervision finish at a record was up 10% for the year. I think we benefit from a number of things, I think we benefit from a fact we have a very unique well franchise. Obviously it was a mix of strong flows underneath that 10% rise. And this reflects a couple of things, obviously the performance we\u2019ve delivered to the clients but I do think it\u2019s the nature of the capabilities that have built over a number of years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So I think so far if you look at as in terms of asset flows, we\u2019re a bit of an outlier. We benefit from scale to your point of fees because we\u2019re certainly not immune to the general shipped in lower fees across the industry whether it\u2019s conventional pure competitor or competitive that\u2019s only dedicated to the asset management space, we are immune to that, but we benefit from having scale in our operation have been near $1.4 trillion on assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Great, now I am wondering on the fee rate side is here a bit of uniqueness you have in the high network client relationship versus institutional \u2026?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">No, I think we have strengthened both client segments but our fees are obviously competitive with the rest of the world.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay, I appreciate it. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Good morning, Harvey; Marty, welcome to the party.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Chavez</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So quick question, I know it\u2019s been touched on a couple of times, but it\u2019s one that\u2019s definitely I think front of investor\u2019s minds here, so hopefully you don\u2019t mind me touch it on it again. And you spoke a little bit of it Harvey with shifting policies globally, we need a better dialog which certainly is positive. But when we think about is especially in the U.S. seen down administration and the themes of the potential for reduced regulation and taxes seems like it could have both a first and second derivative impact on Goldman and so not only the direct impact of you but the clients and clients feeling better and improvement risk apatite. So how do you think about that opportunity assuming that plays out, is there a particular way in which investors should think about that opportunity and is there any historical context or other periods that you think are particularly relevant or helpful and trying to consider that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Well I guess I\u2019d say a few things. I think when you say indirect and direct you mean direct obviously we\u2019ve been relatively high tax payer and so tax rates come down. We\u2019re a beneficiary but obviously changes in tax policy can be a huge catalyst for how all of our clients think about deploying their capital strategic decisions and so that\u2019s board room dialog which obviously we\u2019re always front and center to. So I think that\u2019s what you meant by direct and indirect. So I would agree with that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I think it\u2019s very difficult to quantify just like it was difficult to quantify in 2012, 2013, 2014 how concerns around deflation and low economic growth will impact activity in a number of businesses. I think it\u2019s very difficult to quantify how increased optimism. You know we like to say in some respects, confidence is the best stimulus. And the extent to which we enter a period of increased confidence with respect to economic growth, physical policy, you mentioned tax policy, I think there could be a lot that happens. Now we\u2019ll have to see all these policies of ours. But who knows we could be at the beginning of a long term trend, we may not be. Again it was difficult to predict things in 2012 and how they will be in 2013, 2014 and 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yeah, now that\u2019s fair Harvey and yeah that was exactly what I was pointing on not only direct impact on you but the clients and the optimism. So okay, that\u2019s helpful. You\u2019ve touched also on the operating leverage, so maybe I want to hit on that a bit. It seems like up taking comp ratio in \u201816 was probably more of a revenue story, so want to confirm that\u2019s true and then when we think about maybe the other side of that blade or the other blade of that knife if we start to see revenue environment improve, how should we think about operating leverage at Goldman given all of the work that you\u2019ve done on the expense front which you\u2019ve talked about a couple of times?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Well, I appreciate you are recognizing the work. Obviously over the last several years, whether it\u2019s around expenses, de-risking the firm and growing the capital ratios, returning the capital all that work has really been about positioning the firm, while at the same time obviously maintaining all of our connectivity to clients with really, really significant operating leverage. Now this year revenue is down 9%, compensation expense down 8%, obviously that translate into a small uptick in a compensation ratio. But I would say at this stage, the center which we see hail wins in activity and increases in revenue will see that translating even more so now than we would have before to the bottom line in terms of operating leverage.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And so I can\u2019t quantify for you but if we see a big uptick in revenues, certainly you should see a decline in the compensation of ratio at which of course again as an output we\u2019re committed to delivery in this result.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Terrific, thanks a lot.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Chavez</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">First question is - yeah, good morning and Marty nice to meet you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Chavez</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Question on equities related to follow-up one of the earlier questions that was asked, you talked about maybe there were some things that weren\u2019t quite so perfect. I was wondering if you could characterize that a little bit further were there some episodic block losses that were significant in the quarter, anything that as we think about sort of what\u2019s achievable going forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">There were a handful of transactions that\u2019s it\u2019s always going to be the case in a marking making business when you are providing liquidity to clients that could have an impact that was the case this quarter. Some other things that are normal quarterly contributors and index rebalancing were more neutral and there were impact. Again I wouldn\u2019t read a lot into it from quarter to quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Remember we break out equity client execution from the whole business, so that\u2019s a different level of disclosure then you are going to get from anybody else. So you should expect given at that\u2019s the line where we are most interacting with clients and capital commitments, you should expect that to be more volatile. I just don\u2019t think any of our other competitors whenever break that, so you don\u2019t see it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">No, that\u2019s fair.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">But that\u2019s not - it wasn\u2019t the greatest quarter but there is nothing in there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. And I noticed that when you are doing a full year comparison there you talked about Asia for the full year but not for the fourth quarter, so it was - it was either more of a domestic issue in the fourth quarter or just more broadly global?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Remembering the first half of 2015, there was a huge uptick in activity in Asia and then basically there wasn\u2019t replicated. You know the client connectivity remained robust in Asia as ever but this year just not as active as it was last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Got it, and then a much broader question, I know you don\u2019t like to set ROE targets but I was wondering if in the context of what you might call for example unshackled interest rate sort of in a post QE environment and more broadly some other things that we talked about in terms of the new administrations goals and expectations thereof, can you speak to a realistic but aspiration ROE?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Well, again we don\u2019t say targets because that\u2019s not the way we run the business. We run the business through thoughtful and efficient deployment of capital managing expenses and making sure we have the best people and we\u2019re focused on our clients. I guess you saw some of this in the second half of the year right, we had two plus quarters back to back of 11% plus ROEs and that wasn\u2019t on a huge uptick in activity. And again it\u2019s one date point but it\u2019s one all point two you know in the first quarter 2015, we had a 14.7% ROE, again that feels like a long time ago. We\u2019re actually more efficient now with more operating leverage now than we had then. What we feel as front footed in terms of our franchises we ever have, so we feel well positioned which is that we see the activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And just final follow-up on that point about the activity levels and I know we\u2019ve had all of ten trading days as we get started here, so with all the necessary caveats, how are those activity levels starting the year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Way it\u2019s too early to count Guy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yeah, fair enough. Okay, thanks so much. Thanks for taking my questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Thank you, have a great day.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">You too.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Hey, good morning. Maybe just talk about the revenue side of regulatory change, I know it's not an easy question to answer, but I think there's been a lot of I guess hope and talk about sort of an easing of regulation what that could mean on the revenue side. So I don't know if there's a way to just sort of talk about it generally in terms of where do you see the most constraints right now and what would potentially benefit you the most whether it's easing of market making rules, whether it's some changes like we saw in the UK around exempting cash from the leverage ratio, if you could help that would be great?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yeah, I wouldn't point to any one rule. I think what we've seen and one of the things I think gets lost in the global dialog around regulation is that you know eight years past the crisis, the body of work that's been created by the regulators whether it's Basel capital ratios, the implementation of CCAR, stress testing broadly globally, the leverage ratios, the requirements around liquidity, all those things that were designed to address points to systemic risk, clearing, margin requirements, all of that data reporting, I think sometimes gets lost in the narrative and have to step back and look at the past eight years and realize that and it\u2019s a credible body of work that regulators, the industry participants and the clients have actually created.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I think long - I think the dialog around regulation and whether or not there should be some degree of pause and stepping back, I think that started really at the beginning of last year maybe a little bit before you saw some of that in the Basel Committee across the second half of the year, and obviously I think market participants regulators and also it seems like a very reasonable point in time to step back and assess we obviously have gotten some great benefits out of the regulation and the question is, is there a cost in economic growth. So this seems like a pretty normal part of the process in terms of taking a step back and evaluating it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Now specific rules I don\u2019t know we'll see what happens, it will change, we\u2019ll adapt however they change, I think we demonstrate our ability to do that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">But you can't, you don't feel there's one that's been more constraining than some others in terms of business?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">No, I mean if you actually look at our - if you actually look at our capital ratios they're strong across the board, liquidity is 25% of the balance sheet, and so there's not one thing that we would look at it. I think the bigger question for all of us is it's very difficult to measure the combined impact and the interaction of all these rules, and that's why it makes sense to take a step back.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Now that's all fair. And maybe just a quick one on banking, I think there's been chatter that while I think quote Animal Spirits are better and that's good for the outlook for banking I think there's some concern at least in the near to intermediate term with policy uncertainty that might hold things back a little bit in the shorter term. Are you seeing that it seems like M&amp;A activities continue to be pretty solid, but not sure what you're seeing in terms of activity levels around uncertainty short term policy uncertainty?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Dialog with - dialog in boardrooms remains quite high for us. I think it's fair to say that anytime you have a shift in administration which may present new policies that can have an impact on timing of transactions, because that could be a component. But it's really - it's a timing issue, dialog remains very high.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">But you do see timing being pushed out, what you're seeing or?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I think it could be a little bit, when you start having discussions around tax policy, tax policy obviously will have an implication for how people think about strategic transactions. But again it's an economic important to strategic transaction. It's not the strategy itself as discussed in the boardroom. And so but it could delay some transactions. Remember the transactions coming through from the pipeline before that will be closing. So again I think we're just talking about a timing issue, I actually think the environment is pretty robust in terms of dialog.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay that's great. Thanks a lot.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Chris Kotowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yeah, good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Hi Chris.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Chris Kotowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Hi, on these calls Harvey, you always talk about FICC trading activity in terms of volumes you know like commodities and currencies were up and credit mortgage down and so on. But whenever I speak with fixed income investors they always kind of be mown the lack of available liquidity in the markets, they complain that it's very hard to get anything done. And I'm wondering with between the kind of increased activity that you talked about and retrenchment of some of the competitors have bid ask spreads moved are they widening or is that not yet been part of the equation and do you ever expect that to be part of the equation?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yeah, that's a good question. I think, I think it's - I think you have to parse it a bit, to be just you mentioned commodities well pick up on commodities. If commodity prices are going to be quite stable or just take energy and they're stable at a level for a period of time that is not necessarily a catalyst for big client segments for us producers of commodities, consumers of commodities, in the institutional investors that invest in energy that's honestly catalyst for decision making.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Because they may have very determined levels at which for example a producer wants to hedge future oil production or project that they want to bring online. And so when you then see a big move in oil prices one way or another that's a catalyst for activity for our various client constituents. In terms of liquidity, I think it's fair to say that feedback from clients and it\u2019s not reason it's happened over the last several years across the industry. Is they feel like their ability to execute isn't what it was prior let's say to 2008 as a period it was perceived to have almost limitless liquidity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I think this activity picks up and volume begins volume you get improvements in liquidity, but every day we come in the door and we're offering our balance sheet, our clients in the best possible way that we can.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Chris Kotowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay and then I guess maybe as a follow up to that, I mean to the extent I guess I'd say consensus expectations build in two or three rate hikes a year, at what point does that become you know the kind of catalyst that you talked about in relation to commodities for activity?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I can't predict it for you, again in the fourth quarter alone obviously but if you just - if you just look at fourth quarter of a fourth quarter, and I won't talk about necessarily obviously activity was high and it translate into an up 78% year-over-year for us in fixed income, but the catalyst of activity are pretty obvious, right you have the oil policy, interest rate shifts, movement in currencies, all those things are catalysts for activity. I think again it goes back to the broad question what's the driver of that activity, if the expectation is more progress moving away from deflation not inflationary, but not deflationary more inflationary in a normalized period of interest rates. Those were all positive catalysts what they'll be like quarter-to-quarter very difficult, but again coming out of eight years of declining interest rates, I think would - none of us really wanted to get used to that. And so I think getting into a period of normalized economic growth would normalize policy of normalized interest rates, I think that be a good catalyst over the forward for a number of years. Quarter-to-quarter that who knows.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Chris Kotowski</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">All right. Thank you. That's it from me.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Hey Steven.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Good morning, hey Harvey, hey Marty. So I have follow up just to Jim's earlier question, specifically on tax policy and a comments Harvey that you made on M&amp;A, you said that you view the changes really as more of a timing issue, but one of the constraints that we've been hearing from a lot of folks, is that efforts to broaden the tax base might in fact include restrictions on interest expense deductibility and could increase financing costs and reduce appetite for future debt.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And what I'm wondering is if interest expense deductibility is in fact eliminated we do see reduced appetite from debt from corporates, as I inform your outlook not just from the M&amp;A side, but even for DCM and it might even touch on corporate private equity as well?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Well, but always puts and takes obviously that would be a very significant change in policies so would have implications for the way issuers would think, investors would think capacity, I think there's a lot of what's in the details around that. But I think it's too early to tell in terms of what the necessary predictions would be.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Understood and maybe just sticking to changes in the GOP regime and the implications I could have, but focusing more on the regulatory side there's been a lot of discussion on the prospects of possible repeal or less strict enforcement of Volcker, and Harvey I know you touched on some of the change in terms of just broader messaging, but it just remains to be seen how that might impact your business, I know it's a little bit early, but I just want to get a sense as to if we do see an explicit repeal of Volcker how that would change your strategy, not just on the trading side, but would it in fact how you deploy capital within INL as well?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yeah, so it\u2019s a good question. Look as we said before, we don't make any decisions before we see a rule or rule change there be no difference here. I think most of the discussion around will go over the last several years by regulators and industry participants and clients going back to the earlier question is what impact has it had on market making capabilities across the industry, which is obviously the most important part of our business we're providing liquidity to our clients.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I think in terms of the sort of the micro components of Volcker. We would take a look at it, if it changed in terms of our activities, proprietary trading we haven't been in that business in a long time, it was never a material driver and so we would look at it and whatever in the best interest of our clients and our shareholders that's how we evaluate it just like we devaluate any rule change.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question is from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Good morning, Harvey, good morning Marty. First a specific question then maybe a larger picture question. Harvey could you give us the updated common equity to one ratios for the fully phased in side of things, and just curious what the driver of the reduction in RWA this quarter was it was down about 5% quarter-over-quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So I'll just run through you, I\u2019ll just run through them both transitional and fully phase just the level side even though I went through them before. So under advanced 13/1 transitional 12/7 fully phased standardized again 14.5 I know I said that before fully phase 14. On the RWAs in advance 550 standardized 497 there were a number of drivers again we continue to focus on being efficient with our capital and sort of risk reduction across the number of items, operational risk in advanced was down from 126 to 115 and not just - that just reflects our continued focus on as best we can I mean zero operational risk events. Obviously that's our goal, and so we're starting to see an operational risk as you're starting to see the benefit of our focus flow through as older items roll off albeit as you know that that's a very slow process.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And then for my bigger picture question one of your competitors suggested that there was on a year-over-year basis, but a mid teens decline in European revenues, I guess I'm curious, first of all if you saw that in 2016 versus 2015 in terms of the regional breakout and it with the Prime Minister May\u2019s comments earlier this week any update to your outlook in terms of what Brexit might or might not do to quiet activity more broadly across your European client base?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yeah. So look I have no visibility into anyone else's franchise, the breakdown in terms of our geographic contribution revenues wasn't materially different year-over-year certainly difference in - no meaningful difference in our European franchise. In terms of Brexit as we go through Brexit we just continue evaluated the same way, it is obviously going to be a long process, so in all kind of contingency planners play a very nature so we'll run through different alternatives.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I thought some of the comments with respect to trying to ensure it's not disruptive, there's a long enough runway, all those things I thought some of those comments, but it is going to evolving situation. And so but I wanted to say the sensitivity to financials and understand a criticality of the industry across Europe. But of all those things we\u2019re pretty positive but again we're going to see how this evolves over the next couple years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay, fair enough. And then just finally if I can you booked your first loan in Marcus when we spoke last October, just wondering what the growth in that portfolio has been since them.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yeah we've booked more loans. I'm not counting and wanted time any more though that would have to be aware coincidence with the last call. It's going according to plan. Not in by that I mean our plan have been very deliberate growing it slowly our primary focus here is on the client experience we believe we've built I mean that differentiated for the consumer. And so we're being very attentive to that making sure we incorporate any feedback we get. And obviously risk management something we've done for a long time. So that's a big component of this, but as we've said many times to be a slow process.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Sure, thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">You're welcome. Take care now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question is from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Hey Eric.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Hi how are you? Just to follow up on a couple of questions that have been raised before, but may be taking a little more of a broader view of the balance sheet. I mean your RWAs are now it had fairly low levels now as far back maybe as my model might run. And in INL obviously the balance sheet there continues to decline although you're growing markets a bit. So overall kind of what is your - what should be our expectations about GAAP and RWA growth for 2017 and in particular is there anything that's occurring environmentally that causes you to sort of view that outlook differently than let's say three or six months ago?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">That's a great question. So you know I think I could be wrong on this by the way. So Dan will correct me, but I think it was - I think it was 2012 we were at investor conference and we did our first review of some of the capital tools we have built. And so I guess the best way I would sum it up in terms of how we thought about the risk reduction of the capital of that it goes all the way back to 2012 those tools of course took years to developing themselves. We were just displaying them in 2012 and it's really been about evolving the firm to understand that we need to ensure we use our capital in the most thoughtful way to deliver to our clients.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And as I mentioned before over that period of time we've been able to grow market shares, deliver, I think last for the industry ROEs over a multi-year period of time and at the same time we sit here today with record low share count. So the short answer after that big summary because there are so many people involved across the firm in the divisions with the clients and in the federation it's just been years of hard, hard work and a lot of elbow grease to get us where we are now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">The good thing about that is it gives us a lots of capacity, and it goes back to when we talk about operating leverage sure it's about expenses it's about capital, but it's positioning the firm in a way that we can respond to an uptick. And so I don't know if you asking the question could we grow risk weighted assets I\u2019ll tell you it would be - it's not the scenario I've experienced as CFO.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">But I would wish it for Marty over the years ahead that if he had the chance to deploy capital back to our clients not to return as much to shareholders grow risk weighted assets that actually with the firm has done for the vast majority of the firms history and those are the environments that you know we thrive in and so it was Marty and I'd pass the baton over the next couple of months, I'm hoping he gets to deploy the capital in that way with all of us across the firm. So that's my long winded answer.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Thanks that's very helpful. Thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin Ryan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Thanks, good morning, Harvey, Marty.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Good morning Devin.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Chavez</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin Ryan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Maybe timely with Marty in his new role year, but technology headcounts now about a third of the firm has been the fastest growing area in recent years and arguably the most amount of kind of the newer initiatives have come in this area. So I'm going to put the cart before the horse here, but if we are moving towards more of this business friendly backdrop where regulation softening a bit, can you see a scenario where that trend actually changes in investment high touch personnel is where the incremental growth comes from or is it just technology growth is the secular trend diverse is there being some maybe cyclical component there as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Well maybe I'll kick off and then I'll turn over to Marty and he can talk more specifically about technology, but I wouldn't say there's been a lack of investment in, I think the way you described it some of the other growth areas, right. So we've continue to invest and all parts of the firm, asset management, the new business as we've talked about launching, the acquisition of on line platform. So there's been a lack of investment in areas of the firm for years where we've seen more of a multiyear decline obviously they\u2019ve been super careful as they run those businesses. But I wouldn\u2019t describe it as we\u2019ve invested in technology, we haven\u2019t invested anywhere else. I know you weren\u2019t being that literal about it, but I just want to make sure we are clear for the call.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">But in terms of technology, specifically I\u2019ll turn it over to Marty.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Chavez</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Yeah, so as Harvey says, we invest in both in high touched and low touched and really agnostic where evolving in the direction that our clients that are taking us. So as for technology has clients have continued to transact more electronically we\u2019ve invested more heavily in those capabilities, so that we can better serve them. We have a history of that kind of adaptation. We work with the regulators to make sure that those automated capabilities are the best-in-class and to the extent that the markets continue to be more electronic, technology make our people more effective and it strengthens our clients\u2019 engagement.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin Ryan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay, great understood and appreciate all the color and absolutely you know understand the investments been across the firm, just curious on that incremental technology spend, but thank you. And then within DCM just coming back to some other questions you know had a really terrific year there obviously if the M&amp;A backdrop improves from here that it could be supportive, on the other hand you know higher interest rates you see like my constrain some issuance, I know there is a lot of puts and takes. I am just curious kind of after such a good year, how do you feel about the intermediate term kind of outlook they you think that we can grow from here or kind of as you think about all the moving parts that this is the tough bar?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I\u2019d say a couple of things first, obviously as you point out record year in the underwriting, the team done an amazing job, really working with clients and delivering for clients. So quite proud of that. You know the debt component of the backlog continues to growth, that\u2019s a necessarily forecast this year but the level of client engagement is quite high. I think there is always a temptation for all of us. I certainly do it to think of past cycles when interest rates went up in terms of the implications for markets and the market dynamic. This is such an extraordinary scenario that we\u2019re coming off of basically a zero rate policy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">So I think if you look at history, the rate levels is still pretty low even though the tenner might have moved up a 100 basis points of one point. So I think if you split your questions and say well could you end up with less refinancing, I think that\u2019s certainly a case, but we\u2019re still in a very low rate environment by historical standards and so the extent to which we see growth, company see top line growth. There are CapEx activities and they are feeling confident, they want to finance. I think you could see a pretty good period for debt underwriting over the foreseeable future. But if you saw big rate moves disproportionate charts for someone expected reason, obviously that could have an impact too. I don\u2019t think it more up in rates and in itself, it should necessarily be considered a negative in an absolute sense.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin Ryan</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Great, very helpful, thanks guys.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">You next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yeah, thanks, good morning. Just two quick questions, one in the investment management, with regards to the flows in liquidity products, I mean you\u2019ve seen those kind of flows pickup in the fourth quarter of last two years, is this just where you saw this quarter again a seasonal effect with regards to liquidity products?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">No, I think that has been a trend has been in place, we had a very big commitment to this business. We\u2019re a scale provider in this business makes us very efficient in terms of an aggregator of those kind of flows. And so I don\u2019t know necessarily there is always some seasonality in these businesses but I wouldn\u2019t - this is a long term commitment of this business, I wouldn\u2019t say that is necessarily seasonality in of itself it\u2019s driving it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay. And then just one quick one to on the European equity franchise, have you seen any impacts yet from if it due and kind of what\u2019s your thoughts on long term impacts from if it due as it becomes adopted?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Lot of focus on it, too early to tell.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay, great, thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Your next question is from the line of Christopher Wheeler with Atlantic Equities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christopher Wheeler</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Yes, good morning, gentlemen. Harvey, you\u2019ve been talking a lot about capital efficiency and obviously you\u2019ve been very effective in that area. Can I just ask you a question about the way forward here, because you\u2019ve been obviously very aggressive in buying back stock and keeping the capital sort of very sensible levels, but of course you\u2019ve enjoyed or you could say haven\u2019t enjoyed having stock which is trading at or below book value or tangible book value for the last few years, you\u2019ve not got a situation very happily where you offered about 1.4 times tangible book. I am just wondering I know that you want to keep the dividend at a manageable basis in terms of your payout ratio so that you don\u2019t see in swinging around volatile in a volatile fashion but have you started to think about special dividends which is being the subject that come up rather than buybacks which is start to become dilutive? Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Yeah, so look it\u2019s a good question. Just one think you said that I thought you said something like we enjoyed buying back a little book, just somewhat clear I never.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christopher Wheeler</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I know.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I never felt that enjoyable, I am always running for the share price and I am running our shareholders, so for all of our shareholders I am going to be bit confused. We route for a higher trading level.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Capital management is a long term process and so if you actually did a math in terms of the fourth quarter buying back book causes about $0.24 a share. If you actually did a corporate finance analytics around share repurchase versus dividends, share repurchase because you are reducing share and you are returning capital at the same time are always more accretive than a dividend. Now that\u2019s a map and that sort of stuff. I think the bigger issue is how we want to run the company. And we\u2019re not thinking about changing how we run the company because where the share price is. We try to run the company in the best way for our clients and our shareholders and ultimately that translates to a higher share price.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">But out policy respect to the mix being more heavily weighted to share repurchase, that has suited us quite well. It gives us exactly the kind of flexibility we\u2019ve talked about in the context of this operating leverage goal so that if we see a big pickup in demand, we can deploy that capital to our clients where ultimately that\u2019s our preferred way to deploy the capital. But you shouldn\u2019t expect any change in long term policy in terms of how we think about share repurchase relative to dividends.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christopher Wheeler</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Thank you, very clear.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Harvey Schwartz</span></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">At this time there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Great, since there are no more questions, I\u2019d like to take a moment to thank all of you for joining this call. Hopefully Marty and I as well other members of senior management will see many of you in the coming months. Any additional question come up, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to Dane. Otherwise enjoy your rest of your day and we look forward to speaking with you on our first quarter earnings call on April. Thanks so much everybody, have a great day.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs fourth quarter 2016 earnings conference call.

My name is Rachel, and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Third Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. Also, this call is being recorded today, Tuesday, October 19, 2010. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Dane Holmes </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thank you, Rachel. Good morning, everyone. This is Dane Holmes, Director of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm's belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain and outside of the firm's control. The Firm's actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the Firm's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our current Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year ended December 2009.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><span>I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk weighted assets and global core excess, and you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures and the impact of Basel III that is posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website, <a href=\"http://www.gs.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.gs.com</a>.</span></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">This audio cast is copyrighted material of the Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Our Chief Financial Officer, David Viniar will now review the firm's results. David?</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thanks Dane. I'd like to thank all of you for listening today. I'll give a brief overview of our third quarter results and then take your questions. Third quarter net revenues were $8.9 billion. Net earnings were $1.9 billion and earnings per diluted share were $2.98. Our annualized return on common equity was 10.3%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Our performance in the third quarter resulted in a year-to-date annualized return on common equity of 13.2%, excluding the impact of the U.K. bank payroll tax and SEC settlement. Our book value per share has grown 8% to $127.08 year-to-date.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Many of the market concerns that were most prevalent in the second quarter of 2010 continued into the third quarter, with our client base remaining focused on the macroeconomic outlook, particularly in the United States and Western Europe. Markets were also focused on the implications of global financial regulation, specifically implementation of Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Consequently, investment conviction among institutional asset managers remains low, and while CEO confidence seems to be improving, it remains fragile. These factors, combined with the seasonal dynamics of the third quarter, negatively impacted activity levels within many of our businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">While we experienced modest improvement in activity levels in September, third quarter activity levels for many of our businesses were at or below second quarter levels. For example, NYSE, NASDAQ and LSE average daily share volumes declined significantly compared with the second quarter, down 27%, 20% and 18%, respectively.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">On September 12, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision announced its capital framework generally referred to as Basel III. This announcement represented an important step in providing greater clarity on global regulatory capital requirements. Ultimately, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System will determine how the capital framework will be implemented for financial institutions in the United States. Understandably, our shareholders have been interested in how this development could impact our business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">While there are many aspects of Basel III that still require rule-writing and many rules that require significant guidance and interpretation, we wanted to provide our best estimate of our position on the Basel III with the caveat that these numbers and assumptions could and almost certainly will change.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">At the end of the third quarter, we had a Basel I, Tier 1capital ratio of 15.7%, and a Tier 1 common ratio of 13%. We estimate that our current robust capitalization positions the firm to exceed requirements under the Basel III framework.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">If we calculate Basel III requirements with actual second quarter numbers as of June 30, 2010, our estimated Tier 1 common ratio would be nearly 8.8% before considering any mitigating actions. This assumes risk-weighted assets of approximately $750 billion and Tier 1 common of approximately $59 billion. The principal drivers of the increase in total risk-weighted assets are higher credit risk-weighted assets for private equity investments in DVA and higher market risk-weighted rated assets for securitization and correlation risk exposures.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">If we assume contractual roll off of our correlation portfolio, expected duration of our mortgage securitization book, coupled with 2.5 years of forward earnings at the 2010 consensus estimates, our Tier 1 common ratio would increase to 11% by the end of 2012. Of course there are many additional steps that we can and will take to further increase our capital ratios.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We also continue to maintain significant excess liquidity, which average $173 billion during the third quarter. While we are awaiting more clarity on rules for the liquidity coverage ratio under Basel III, the concept is very similar to how we manage liquidity with our Global Core Excess and internal liquidity model. We estimate that our current Global Core Excess will comfortably exceed requirements under the new rule set.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Another area of investor focus has been the procedural concerns associated with foreclosure affidavits. In December 2007, we acquired Litton Loan Servicing, a subprime loan servicer. Litton is well known for providing borrowers with alternatives to foreclosure, particularly modifications.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Since 2008, Litton has completed over 80,000 permanent loan modifications.  Additionally, approximately one out of every four loans currently serviced has been modified.  In the states where the foreclosure process has been suspended Litton currently has approximately 23,000 loans in the foreclosure process.  Litton's initiated an extensive review of it's foreclosure procedures, while certain process issues are identified as part of the review to date Litton believes the underlying foreclosure decisions were warranted.  I'll now review each of our businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Investment banking produced revenues of $1.1 billion, up 22% from the second quarter.  Third quarter advisor revenues were $496 million, up 5% from the second quarter.  Goldman Sachs ranked first in the announced and completed M&amp;A globally to date and advise \u2013 year to date and advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the third quarter.  These include GDF SUEZ's $21.5 billion transactions in international power, Intel $7.7 billion acquisition of McAfee and Dynegy's $4.7 billion sales for Blackstone.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We were also advisors in a number of significant completed transactions including Novartis's $28.4 billion acquisition of the stake in Alcon, Schlumberger's $11 billion acquisition of Smith International and Millipore's $7 billion sale for Merck.  Third quarter underwriting net revenues were $623 million.  Equity underwriting revenues are up 30% from the second quarter to $288 million driven by stronger client activity particularly in Asia.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Goldman Sachs ranked first year to date in common stock offerings globally.  Debt underwriting was 50% to $355 million.  This primary issuance is robust across both leverage finance and investment grade markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">During the third quarter, we participated in many note worthy underwriting transactions.  Including, Agricultural Bank of China's $22.1 billion initial public offering, Impax Corporation $6.2 billion following offering and Valeant Pharmaceuticals combined $1.2 billion high-yield notes offering and $1.6 billion term loan.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Our investment banking backload was flat with the second quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Let me now turn to trading in principle investments, which is comprised of fixed equities and principles investments.  Net revenues were $6.4 billion in the third quarter and includes CVA losses of approximately $200 million associated with the tightening of credit spreads on our own debt mostly in debt.  [Sick net] revenues were $3.8 billion in the quarter, down 14% from the second quarter.  During the third quarter continued macro-economic certainties acerbated seasonally slow customer activity levels and drove weaker sequential revenues across interest rates, mortgages and commodities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Currency revenues were up modestly from the second quarter levels.  Our credit business improved sequentially as a strong issuance calendar and technical support from solid flows into fixed income funds provided a favorable backdrop.  Turning to equities, net revenues from the third quarter were $1.9 billion, up 53% sequentially.  Equities trading net revenues of $1.1 billion represented a significant improvement compared to the second quarter and reflected a more normalized contribution from our derivatives franchise.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Equities commissions were down 18% to $806 million reflecting lower client activity levels during the quarter.  During to risk, average daily value at risk in the third quarter was $121 million, down 11% from the second quarter on lower volatility and continued low activity levels.  Let me now review principal investments which produced net revenues of $754 million in the third quarter.  Our principal investing portfolio generated net gains of $613 million, largely on corporate public equity investments.  We also benefited from overrides of $132 million that were principally driven to $2.25 billion partial sale of the investment of ICBC during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In asset management and security services we reported third quarter net revenues of $1.4 billion, up 2% from the second quarter.  Asset management produced net revenues of $1 billion, up 5% from the second quarter.  Asset management increased $21 billion sequentially to $823 billion, driven largely by market appreciation, partially offset by money market and equity outflows.  Security services produced net revenues of $383 million, down 4% from the seasonally stronger second quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Now let me turn to expenses.  Compensation benefits expense which is a reminder, include, salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior equity awards and other items was accrued at a compensation net revenues ration of 43%.  [Indiscernible] the first two quarters of 2010 and our lowest nine month ratio as a public company.  Third quarter non-compensation expenses decreased 24% sequentially, $2.3 billion, primarily driven by the SEC settlement that was included in the second quarter results.  <br><br>Total staff at the end of the third quarter was approximately $35,400, up 45 from the second quarter, reflecting the normal seasonal pattern of new college and business school starting in the summer.  In keeping with the firm's long-standing policy of repurchasing shares.  The offset increased in share account over time resulting from employee share-based compensation.  We repurchased 5.4 million shares of common stock during the third quarter for a total cost of approximately $800 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Even after the share repurchase common shareholders equity increased almost $2 billion during the quarter to $68.7 billion.  The operating environment during the third quarter was denominated by heightened uncertainties surrounding the global economic outlook, which contributed to lower activity levels across our global client base.  As you know our ability to generate revenues and return to our shareholders is dependent on our clients transacting in the market place, whether it\u2019s a CEO who wants to expand to an acquisition or a portfolio manager deciding to allocate capital to different investment strategies the opportunity for our firm begins with the client's decision to act.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">While we've seen some modestly positive signs in recent weeks, it's difficult to predict the catalyst for improved client activity especially since human psychology can be an important driver.  However, we believe that it's critical to remain focused on serving our clients and executing our strategy.  We believe that these efforts will ultimately drive the strength of our franchise and the value that it can generate for investors over the longer term.  With that I'd like to thank you again for listening today and I'm now happy to take your questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Question-and-Answer session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">(Operator instructions).  Your first question comes from Guy Moszkowski with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Good morning, David.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Morning, Guy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">I just wanted to go back to your comments on Basel III and obviously I know it's very preliminary as you said.  First of all, can you just give us a sense for what your asset growth assumptions are underlying the runoff of the asset classes that you alluded to?</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">It\u2019s in the numbers that we gave and I'm glad you mentioned what you did, Guy because I gave a lot of caveats about how preliminary these numbers are so I just want to emphasize that.  All we did was take our assets as they stand now with no growth of any kind and we took earnings for, as I said we just took 2010 consensus and we assumed that that's what their earnings are going to be for the next two and a half years and then we just assumed contractual roll offs of the correlation book and basically the ratio rate in roll off of mortgage and securitization but no acts of mitigation, no growth, no decline, just those assumptions, made no other adjustments.  That's ...</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Right, so you also assumed no return of capital other than the existing dividend is that fair?</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We assume no return of capital.  We assume no equity based compensation that would grow it.  We \u2013 only the three assumptions mentioned, those are the only changes that we put in to that 11% number.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">And since you mention that you chance didn\u2019t do any \u2013 in this exercise you didn\u2019t do any active mitigation can you give us a sense for what types of active mitigation you might consider?</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Sure, let me, let me give you just a couple of quick things that could help.  For example, we didn\u2019t assume that we made any attempt to reduce the correlation book through tariffs with other dealers.  We didn\u2019t assume the same thing with mortgage securitizations.  We didn\u2019t assume that any of the \u2013 we have a few assets that are subtractions from our capital because they're intangibles that we can probably sale and probably will sale over time.  We didn\u2019t assume that.  We didn\u2019t assume any roll offs of our principal investment portfolio either just from things being sold or from attempts to sell them.  Just a few of the things that come to mind quickly.  We didn\u2019t make any of those assumptions at all.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">That\u2019s helpful and then just a final question on this topic.  From what you can see right now, how might the implementation of Basel III impact your traditional approach to capital management if at all?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Well, I don\u2019t think it's going to approach our \u2013 it's going to change our approach to capital management but you know there are some businesses that you know like the ones I mentioned like correlation and securitization businesses that you know given the very, very high, high capital charges might be diminished.  Now none of those you know have been that big for us over time but they still would sit and certainly we would probably do less of them.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">All right and then just to follow up you mentioned you \u2013 you obviously mentioned that Dodd-Frank in your remarks and the uncertainty that that has created.  Can you give us any update as to what changes you might be making either strategically or tactically to address some of the elements of Dodd-Frank such as [Indiscernible] or changes in derivatives?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Well it's too early on some of the things because as you know certainly on derivatives most of the rules are not written yet, we're still you know working on that.  There are some things that have been pretty public I mean it's been written and its accurate that you know are GSPS business which is the one you know [Indiscernible] our trade business essentially wound down.  So that's the one thing and the other things we're waiting to see how the rules unfold.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">And final question, just as a follow up to that, how do you see it potentially effecting the special situation?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Again, we're waiting to see how those rules, rules unfold but the predominate part of that business is a business that is actually a lending business, which we think is not only okay under the rules but is actually that this encourage because it you know obviously helps the economy grow.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Fair enough.  Thanks very much, David.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">You're welcome, Guy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Your next question comes from Howard Chen with Credit Suisse.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Howard Chen \u2013 Credit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Good morning, David.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Good morning, Howard.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Howard Chen \u2013 Credit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Appreciate you taking a crack at the Basel III impact.  Just a follow up on the mitigation efforts whether its runoff or active mitigation how do you think about the P&amp;L impact and maybe the current ROA of those businesses or portfolios that might be running off or shedding?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Well again, it\u2019s a little hard to tell and again, the caveats of all of the numbers are very preliminary but the businesses that we've talked about have not been that big in the context of the firm.  You know it hasn\u2019t been \u2013 none of the things we've talked about are our basic you know client franchise trading business that are really the [Indiscernible] and so you know that you know is very hard to estimate will there be any material change from that but we don\u2019t know yet.  We're going to have to wait and see.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Howard Chen \u2013 Credit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Okay and then just in your mind set, David, you know that not bigger material is 5% -- a ball park range for them?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">You're being more prescriptive than I would try to be but I wouldn\u2019t dispute those numbers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Howard Chen \u2013 Credit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Okay and then even with the whatever buffers come down the path, 11% again with all the caveats and the assumptions seems like  a very strong and health level capital you know when would you and the mentoring team feel comfortable ramping up the share repurchase to maybe do more than just offset the recent share issuance?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Well our first hope would be that we don\u2019t and that we see tremendous opportunities out there which give an ability to use our capital to you know produce returns.  So that would be first \u2013 our first goal would be to do it that way plus give it back but if we don\u2019t then you know over the next several years we would certainly consider giving back more capital to the shareholders.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Howard Chen \u2013 Credit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Great and then you know I guess, finally, David, I think you know just thinking about the summer environment and the record levels you've been underwriting we see and I know historically you know just to paraphrase maybe the management team has stated maybe in certain times not \u2013 that it doesn\u2019t make sense to be a Top III underwriter and just given where we are in the world today, these extended Euro rates, etc.  The liquidity that's out there.  Does the view change at all you know just given that with respect to where you want to be as a debt underwriter globally?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Look debt underwriting as you know that's investment grade debt underwriting is not the highest of margin of businesses we have.  It's an important business to the firm.  We would like to be a leader in that business.  Again, a lot of that business is based to some extent on using a balance sheet and we're not going to be a leader in that.  So I think the chances that you would see us be a Top III investment grade debt underwriter are not high but we always want to be a major player because it's important for our clients and so we're going to be a you know we're going to be one of the leaders but probably not one of the Top III in the lead [Indiscernible].</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Howard Chen \u2013 Credit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">And maybe just a quick follow up with that, David, it doesn\u2019t \u2013 you know looking at who's reported of your peers to date it doesn\u2019t feel like you've given up any share or relative revenue share on, on stiff trading but how do you think you know that positioning in debt underwriting changes your relative stance with respect to kind of the fixed trading environment in the credit sub-cluster?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">I think it has a very little effect.  We're a big enough player there, and I think our willingness to commit our capital on behalf of our clients, help them with their risk management, I think is a much bigger factor.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Howard Chen \u2013 Credit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Great. Thanks so much for taking all the questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">You\u2019re welcome</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Your next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Nomura.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Glenn Schorr \u2013 Nomura</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Hi, thanks Dave. So, you guys were never a huge originator, but given all the attention on mortgage put-back risk and all the related issues, can you just may be frame how you see Goldman's position in the food chain and maybe any experience you have had so far?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">I know you have heard this from others but\u2013 I would again give a caveat that it's a very fluid and evolving situation, but we really are pretty small. As you know mortgages while important to Goldman Sachs has always been the smallest of our fixed businesses, never a very large business. To put it in context in the origination, I mean we had a tiny underwriter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">I looked at the statistics, the 40th largest underwriter from 2005, 2008, I am sorry, 40th largest originator, originated $30 billion of loans over that period of time and we originated $1.75 billion. So, we're really tiny in the market, and that drove us to not be one of the leaders in underwriting either. I mean, we were an underwriter, we did it, we are a player in the market, but we are just not one of the leading players.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So, while it's something we continue to watch, and if you've heard from others, there hasn't been that much experience at some parts of it yet. We just don't view our exposures there as being large in the context of the market.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Glenn Schorr \u2013 Nomura</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Switching gears, just a numbers thing, the staff at period end, and I know that's employees, consultants and temp staff, and I hear you on the 4% seasonal pickup, but it's up 12% year-on-year. It's a little bit of a of head scratcher considering the environment of what's happened with revs, can you give a little color on where that has taken place?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Sure. I think what I'll tell you is a fair amount of it on a percentage basis is outside the United States, where as you know is where we've targeted a lot of our growth. Also, a lot on the risk management side and the control side of the firm, as we get on some of the new regulatory environment. So, we thought that that was appropriate. As you said, the 4% this quarter was -- probably 80% was campus hiring. So, that's really to be expected, but that was really the \u2013 the areas of growth were some of the place we've talked about initially, outside the U.S., control and our investment management division.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Glenn Schorr \u2013 Nomura</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">I just want to touch on something that you said, in terms of the netting out of contracts with other broker-dealers that are going to be facing the same increase in risk-weighted assets, to me that seems like an incredibly real and logical place for everyone to go play, and there 's got to be places where we owe you 80 bucks and they owe you 80 bucks and you net things out. How real is that on the active mitigation front? It gets thrown into one liner, but it seems like a big deal?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Again, as I mentioned, we assumed none of it in the numbers that I gave you. But is it real, it should be real. It's complicated because every one of these transactions individually is different, so to pair them off, you have to make sure that you are not accidentally increasing your risk by doing it, but it's something that should be able to happen over time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Glenn Schorr \u2013 Nomura</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Is that process full force right now? You have people behind the scenes, some of that increased headcount looking at this exclusively?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">I think there is some of it going on, but there is still \u2013 people are still interpreting the rules as they go forward to mitigate some of the issues.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Glenn Schorr \u2013 Nomura</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Alright, cool. Thank you Dave</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">You\u2019re welcome</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Your next question comes from Michael Carrier with Deutsche Bank.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Thanks David</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Good morning</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Just one more question on the Basel III. If we think that we get the disclosure from Basel in November and then based on the clarity that you've given now, from the clarity from the Fed for a timeframe, when would you expect to be in a fairly good position where you can now just do the buybacks to offset dilution or you can start looking for opportunities in the market and redeploying the capital?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Well, I am not one who is going to try to anticipate when our regulators might act. So, what they do is completely up to them. But as I said before, our hope is that we're not giving capital back. Our hope is that we're finding opportunities to use it, and if we can't I would suspect as these rules get more and more clarified over the next several years we would be in a position to give more capital back. It's hard to pin down an exact date though.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Then on the OTC side, obviously, still have a lot of rulemaking to be done there, but when you look at the likely changes, do you see, and a lot of firms are not, but like a technology driven opportunity for clearing like you guys developed in the equities business for GMA? What would you expect the capital and risk weighted asset benefits to be from using a clearing house versus having trade bilateral on the balance sheet? Finally, just based on the rules under consideration, are there a few of them out there that you are focused on in terms of that could be harmful to the market or to the liquidity in the markets?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Again, it's very hard for me to give you exact numbers on what capital might be freed up. As I mentioned, we didn't assume any capital being freed up in the numbers that I gave, but as things do move to the central clearing and central exchanges, there should be some opportunities for capital being freed up, but it's very hard for us to quantify so I just didn't assume any of that in the numbers I gave you. That will be just an additional benefit. I guess as far as the rules, we're focused on \u2013 the things that affect us are the whole question of derivatives and all the various parts of it. The Volker rule and how that's interpreted and how market making is ultimately interpreted and those are probably the biggest things we are looking at.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay, and then the last one, smaller business, but on the asset management side, you still have like about 5% decay rate on the outflows, mostly on equities and the industry has been challenged there. But just given your weighting more on the institutional side, I guess from a allocation perspective are you seeing any change there and is there anything \u2013 issue in terms of performance, you've had a little bit of turnover, just more of the outlook on that business?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">What you've seen with us is you've seen the outflow from equities, which you have just seen across the entire industry, we said a slight inflow into fixed income, which is what you've seen. We had some more money market outflows. I think that's partially because we have a somewhat more conservative credit posture in our money market business and when you do that, and it costs you a few basis points and money markets are only returning a few basis points, it's a bigger percentage. So, we are okay with that, because we think that conservative credit view is warranted. So, I think it's really just more industry dynamics than anything else at this point.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay, thanks a lot.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question comes from Ed Najarian with ISI Group.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Ed Najarian - ISI Group</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Good morning. I just actually had a quick question on some of the numbers you threw out around Basel III. Correct me if I am wrong, but I think you said that if you adjusted your Tier 1 common ratio at the end of the second quarter to a Basel III basis, you'd be at 8.8%?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">No, that might have been the way it came out, because I started a little low but I said nearly 8%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Ed Najarian - ISI Group</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay, that works. Thank you</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question comes from Roger Freeman with Barclays Capital.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Roger Freeman - Barclays Capital</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hey, good morning David</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Good morning Roger</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Roger Freeman - Barclays Capital</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So, I guess you commented on one of Howard's question, you have a reason to deploy capital really rather than buyback stock, which obviously would be ideal, but then I am kind of tying back to your liquidity levels and you're running at basically the levels you were during the height of the credit crisis. And I am wondering, is that a function of that there isn't; an outlet to deploy that capital today, or that more a function of just where you think best state is to be invested right now, particularly given that rates have been coming in?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I would say it is a combination of the two, but probably a little bit more of the former. We are running really higher than at the height of the credit crisis right now. I think we'd want it to be high. I mean the world is still not a very safe place. There are issues out there. There's uncertain economic outlook in many places. So, we want to be running a higher than normal liquidity reserve, but one of the reasons it is high as it is, is there is just no call on it right now. The same reason our risk is so low and our balance sheet really hasn't grown, there has just been no call on it because there has been very, very little activity from our clients.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Roger Freeman - Barclays Capital</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I guess, just a follow-up on Volcker, so for GSPS gets rundown, your defending (NYSEARCA:<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FSG\" title=\"FactorShares 2X Gold Bull/S&amp;P 500 Bear ETF\">FSG</a>) the direct corporate equity and real estate investments, it seems like those are probably okay as well. Obviously, they're not addressed by the short-term trading rules, is that fair to say?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I think we're just waiting to see what the final rules say.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Roger Freeman - Barclays Capital</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I had thought that maybe the challenge there would be the Basel rules, applying a higher RWA, but it sounds like you kind of come out so well on the pro forma (calyx) that that probably would not be a driver if you're thinking, right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">At it does is, it affects the returns. You have to make sure that \u2013 that whatever you do, given what's capital charges are have high enough returns, and if it does then we'll continue to do business and if not then we won't.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Roger Freeman - Barclays Capital</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Compensation, you're running 43% year-to-date, fair to assume that that's a reasonable full year run rate.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">It's fair to assume that it's a reasonable three quarters run rate.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Roger Freeman - Barclays Capital</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Equity trading, can you quantify how much the vol short impact was because there is a such a discrepancy even relative to I think what people thought the impact was like $300 million or $400 million given that commissions were down, and you were up like $600 million or $700 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I'm not going to give you exact numbers, but suffice to say and I think I said it last quarter, the biggest diver of what's going on is activity levels, not the tick-up in vol last quarter and the tick-down. That had some effect on it. But while it recovered this quarter you can see that by historical measures, it still wasn't a great quarter. It's fine.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">It was good given what you saw available in the market, but if you think of \u2013 I don't want to say normal activity levels. I don't think any of these is normal. If you think of historical actively level and historical performance in equities trading, it still wasn't such a great quarter. So, while the vol trading had something to do -- the movement had something to do that, it just wasn't as material as people think it was.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Roger Freeman - Barclays Capital</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay, but the quarter-to-quarter swing relative to the 17% decline in commissions, if you blackout vol, it sounds like there's still not going to be a lot of consistency between those numbers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I am sorry. I missed the end of your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Roger Freeman - Barclays Capital</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">It just sounds like, there's still, relative to the activity levels and what you saw on the commissions that there still seems to be somewhat of a disconnect?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Again, you've seen this over time, you've seen there be a disconnect between commissions and equities trading because commission just, plain vanilla share purchases was \u2013 trading is driven much more by corporate activity and when they want to risk manage. You saw slight pick-up and I don't want to overstate this at all, a slight pick-up in that activity in September, which was helpful. That's really what drove the change, as well as some impact of the difference in vol trading.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Roger Freeman - Barclays Capital</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay, great. Thanks David</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">You\u2019re welcome</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>James Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Good morning, maybe just a quick question on just the risk-weighting issue, I mean, if we looked at your latest disclosure in 3Q '09 on sort of the buckets of risk-weighting between market risk, operational risk, credit risk, your market risk was dramatically higher when we look at the European banks, and there seems to be very large disconnect on the market risk side, and it seems to me based on current disclosures and that is going to persist under Basel III, and as sort of the risk adjusted ratio minimums increase, how much of a worry is that for you, is the absolute capital levels that you're carrying at the same level of assets versus your European counterparts? Does that create some sort of ability for them to under price you on fixed income trading or other businesses?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">We are hopeful that there will be international harmonization of rules. We don't know they are going to be, we hope they will be, we hope people don't use regulatory arbitrage. But there has always been some of that out there. It hasn't had a major effect in the past and we will do what; A, our regulators tell us is appropriate; and B, what we think is appropriate for safety and soundness, regardless of what others do.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>James Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Sure, I just think as ratios go higher that difference becomes bigger right and that's at some point is kind of a critical mass where it does become an issue, hasn't been, but does become one.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>David Viniar</strong><br><br>It's hard to predict, but all I can tell you is it hasn't been so far.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>James Mitchell - Buckingham Research<br></strong><br>One last question on the securitization side. There has been a lot of questioning around the securitization just as a whole. If there is a way to put back the whole securitization, it seems more focused on the issuers, but as an underwriter and as sponsor of securitizations, do you feel that there is any risk there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>David Viniar</strong><br><br>As I said at first, it's very fluid, so I don't want to give you a definitive answer and have you say, well you said that, very fluid, but we think most of the risk is as an originator and even as an underwriter our position in markets was just \u2013 we were not one of the biggest players. So we don't think our exposure is that big.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>James Mitchell - Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Got you. Alright, thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">You\u2019re welcome</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator<br><br></strong>your next question comes from Kian Abouhossein with JPMorgan.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JPMorgan</strong><br><br>On Basel 2.5 when the rules are final, I was wondering \u2013 and they are coming in at the end of 2011, I was wondering if you can give us also an indication how your Basel 2.5 equity Tier 1 number would look like.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>David Viniar</strong><br><br>I don't have them separated out to 2.5 and 3 here, but we can certainly get back to you offline and give you those numbers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JPMorgan<br><br></strong>On Basel III, what do you see as your minimum level of equity Tier I that you think you should be having in your business? What is your view on contingent capital?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>David Viniar<br></strong><br>You asked several questions, but they are actually several good questions. So the one on what minimum, as you know, when always said and done, the minimum requirement as we know now before any other things are put in is 7% on Tier 1 common. Now, it's a while before that's actually in place, but that's ultimately what it's going to be. There may be things on top of that. We don't know. Exactly where we are going to run if that's the minimum, I can't tell you, but we'll run with the buffer as we always have.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We're never going to run very, very close to the line. That we don't think that will be a prudent way to manage our business. So we will always run with some amount of buffer and it's going to depend on the market environment, earnings, risks and other things. So, we will just have to see that over time. I think as far as contingent capital goes, I think contingent capital, if structured correctly, could be a useful part of people's capital structures, but again we are going to have see what rules are, how it can be structured, what the market reaction is going to be and there is a lot of unanswered questions at this point.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JPMorgan</strong><br><br>On the $59 billion on Basel III equity Tier 1, what is the major negative adjustment, because that's a net number, but I would be quite interested even if in subjective terms what the major negative adjustments are to understand maybe what you could potentially mitigate there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>David Viniar</strong><br><br>The single biggest negative adjustment is that cumulative preferred no longer accounts as good Tier 1 capital and we have about $5 billion of that. That's the biggest negative adjustment. Then there's a few other smaller ones that \u2013 and that $5 billion, obviously it could be replaced, but it can't be mitigated. Then there's a few other smaller ones having to do with some of the ways different things are calculated, some of which might be mitigateable and some which won't, but that's the biggest one by far.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JPMorgan</strong><br><br>If I may ask one more question, we hear from most banks that want to reduce correlation books/liquid, exposures securitization books, but who's going to be on the other side you think refinancing or buying these assets?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David Viniar<br></strong><br>Again, a fair number of the trades are dealers-to-dealers. So, as with -- you can get tear ups amongst a number of dealers which does not necessarily increase risk, but you had a fair amount of balance sheet being used, because it was low capital without a lot of risk being taken. So, I think some number can be rolled off that way. I think the other places there might be private pools of capital out there that don't have similar capital charges and become bigger players in this business. I think that the third piece is, as these things roll off, I think in some cases, they are not going to be replaced.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JPMorgan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Great. Thank you very much for your answers</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">You\u2019re welcome</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator<br></strong><br>Your next question comes from Mike Mayo with CLSA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA<br></strong><br>Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Good morning Mike</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Just a follow-up on Basel III, so you have $750 billion of risk-weighted assets under Basel III as of the second quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David Viniar<br></strong><br>Approximately.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA<br></strong><br>How low could that go? What are some kind of ranges after you take some mitigation actions?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David Viniar</strong><br><br>I think some of these things we talked about on \u2013 some of the things just from what I talked about get you down to the $700 million range, and then there is other active mitigations that could take it lower than that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong><br><br>When you're saying taking it lower, I mean some other banks have talked about cutting the increase in half. Is that reasonable?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David Viniar</strong><br><br>I think that sounds pretty big to me, but I don't want to say we can't. Look, if it were a really slow world and we reduced our balance sheet dramatically, maybe we would, but in a more normal operating environment that would seem like a bigger decrease than I would anticipate.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA<br></strong><br>Maybe of the $300 billion increase, may be you could cut off $100 billion or so. Is that fair?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David Viniar<br></strong><br>We could \u2013 with the things I told you, we get down to $700 and maybe we can go lower from there. Past that Mike, I think I'd just be making up numbers, and I don't want to do that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong><br><br>Then separately, can you give some sense of linked-quarter revenue trends by region, especially Asia?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David Viniar</strong><br><br>I believe and I'll come back to you if what I am telling you is not correct, but I believe that the revenue trends you saw for the overall firm were not all that different by region.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong><br><br>How much is Asia and non-U.S. in this quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David Viniar</strong><br><br>Round numbers, I'll always tell you, be careful quarter-over-quarter, round numbers, U.S. is 55%, non-U.S. is 45%, and Europe is a little bigger than Asia of the non-U.S.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong><br><br>Then lastly, as far as the trends in the quarter, risk appetite trading, how would you characterize say September versus the prior two months and is that continuing into this quarter or is that falling off?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David Viniar<br></strong><br>So here is what I would say with the very, very big caveat that you can't read anything into a month. September was an uptick from July and August, but July and August were really slow. Now, it was modestly better, it wasn't that things were worrying in September. As I said, modestly better September than July and August, and October is continuing for now more or like September, but I really caution you not to read very much into it because it could change quickly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Got it. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">You\u2019re welcome</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong><br><br>Your next question comes from Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer</strong><br><br>Most of my question have been asked and answered, but maybe you could flush out a little bit the overseas expansion that you're talking about. Is it more people based or capital based, is it origination or trading, can you flush it out a bit for us?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David Viniar</strong><br><br>I think you've heard us say before that we think the biggest growth opportunities, we see as a Firm, are going to be in the growth market. And we think that, as you've heard us say many times before, the most important thing for us is activity and activity tends to go with economic growth. We think there is going to be more growth in the growth markets than in developed markets, not that there won't be growth in developed markets. So, we're growing our headcount and we're committing capital in those markets faster than in the developed markets, and its really for all of our businesses. It's for our investment banking business, our trading business or asset management business, all of them.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay, thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator<br></strong><br>Your next question comes from Mark Lane with William Blair and Company.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Mark Lane - William Blair and Company<br><br></strong>Good morning. I just had a question \u2013 quick one on the backlog. I would have thought with dialog levels up, it seems to be build-in a little bit, that the backlog would have improved sequentially. Have you changed your views in terms of the probability of success on the current pipeline or how you are looking at that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>David Viniar<br><br></strong>Backlog, well directionally it can sometimes tell you things. You have to be careful with backlogs, because for example, merger deals always get into backlog, because they take a while, equity deals, IPO would tend to get into backlog, because they take a while, following offerings quite often. Don't get into backlog, because you might get a call in one day and do a block or do an accelerated book build and get done in a couple of days.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Also, between quarters something might come in and out in the same quarter. So, I think it's more of a timing question of accruals versus a one time shift than anything else. I would characterize the investment banking activity as up somewhat from what you have seen, but again the question is if the economy has turndown and more bad news comes out then a lot of equity deals won't get done, a lot of mergers won't happen, but if things stay stable or trend up a little bit then I think you will see a pretty big pick up.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Mark Lane - William Blair and Company</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay, thanks for that clarification.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">You\u2019re welcome</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator<br></strong><br>Your next question comes from Jeff Harte with Sandler O'Neill.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Jeffrey Harte - Sandler O'Neill</strong><br><br>Good morning. A couple of things. As we talk about what the outlook will be, you mentioned a lot of things. As far as what to watch, I mean does it really come down to a macro call and watch how the global economy performs and if growth resumes business levels will pick up?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>David Viniar<br><br></strong>I think if growth resumes and regulation gets clarified, then you should see business start to pick up. Then you should see activity levels start to pick up. Then it is up to us to take advantage of that and to do what our clients need and be able to be there for them and hopefully profit from it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Jeffrey Harte - Sandler O'Neill</strong><br><br>We've seen some more distressed assets, some distressed debt activities in the markets. It seems as though quarter after quarter, we talk about you guys have anything capital to deploy, but prices not necessarily getting low enough. It seems like some of the banks are starting to be some sellers of distressed portfolios, do you have a feel for whether offers are coming down versus bids going up and how you're kind of looking at distressed opportunities?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>David Viniar<br></strong><br>I think you're seeing both of those things. I think offers are coming down and bids are going up. We've seen a few more deals than we've seen in the past, but they're \u2013 so far we haven't seen very \u2013 we haven't seen a material amount that we thought met our return hurdles. But you're seeing a little bit more activity than you've seen. So, there are possibilities that more of those will happen. There are also possibilities that more will happen at prices that we don't think give us the return hurdle, and so it won't be something that's major for us. We just don't know yet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Jeffrey Harte - Sandler O'Neill<br></strong><br>Finally, this has been hit on but I want to make sure I got it correctly. When it comes to kind of the put back, the rep and warranty type stuff, I mean, certainly your role as a mortgage originator was small. The role in securitizing or mortgage CDOs was bigger, still smaller than most but bigger. It sounds as though you're saying from a securitizer of mortgage CDOs, where you weren't the underlying asset originator there is not a whole lot of risk of things coming back to you. Am I putting words into your mouth?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>David Viniar</strong><br><br>Yes. What I said was we weren't that big. In the context to the market, we weren't that big. The situation is fluid. There's a not a lot we've seen so far that causes us to think we're going to have that much exposure. But it's very fluid and we don't know yet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Jeffrey Harte - Sandler O'Neill</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay, thanks</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">You\u2019re welcome</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong><br><br>Your next question comes from Douglas Sipkin with Ticonderoga.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Douglas Sipkin - Ticonderoga</strong><br><br>Thank you and good morning David. Just two questions, one, obviously the backlog is flat. Maybe from a geographical standpoint I was just curious; we've seen a little bit of life just a touch of life in Europe in terms of secondary equities. Just curious if you guys expect to see more of a pickup there with a couple of institutions getting ahead of some of these regulatory requirements, and then secondly, I know you guys have talked about the low rate environment impacting returns. Is there sort of like a \u2013 obviously a steep curve but a magic type of level where you'll like to see the tenure at where you think it's optimal for you guys?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>David Viniar</strong><br><br>On your first question, it's very hard for me to predict what companies are going to do, and obviously, if I knew I couldn't tell you. So it's very hard to answer that question. Where we've seen the most pick-up over the last several months has been Asia. I mean, you've seen more deals coming out of Asia than anywhere and it's not a surprise given the growth trajectory there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">It's very hard to give you a magic number of the tenure rate. As you've heard me say before, the real key is for growth to pick up again. Obviously, as rates continues to come down, it tends to imply that growth is forward, not higher, so slightly higher rates would be better not because of its higher rates, but because it probably means that you've seen more growth and I believe it's more activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Douglas Sipkin - Ticonderoga</strong><br><br>But just to come back to the first question, and I probably know the answer, if there were activity sort of like a secondary, it's really possible, it's not even in the backlog right now because it's something that sort of comes together quicker? I am not asking you to comment on anything specific, but I am just trying to understand the dynamics of the way you guys calculate the backlog?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>David Viniar</strong><br><br>No, that's absolutely correct. European bank could decide on Wednesday that they want to do a writes offering and they want to announce it on Friday, again it wouldn't go into backlog. We talk to them, hopefully it would be one of the leaves where they could announce they want to do an accelerate book build and do it the next day, so that might never get into the backlog.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Douglas Sipkin - Ticonderoga</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">You\u2019re welcome</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong><br><br>Your next question comes from Matthew Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Matthew Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities</strong><br><br>Good morning. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. I just have a couple of clarifications. David when you were going through the pro forma Basel III capital ratios, the $59 billion number that you quoted, that's Tier 1 common, correct?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>David Viniar</strong><br><br>Tier 1 common, that's correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Matthew Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities</strong><br><br>Okay, and then the modest DVA number in the quarter was 200 million across both equity and debt, but largely in FICC?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>David Viniar<br></strong><br>That's correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Matthew Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay, thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">You\u2019re welcome</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong><br><br>Your next question comes from Steve Stelmach with FBR Capital Markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Steve Stelmach - FBR Capital Markets</strong><br><br>Good morning. You just mentioned Asia and it looks by some accounts that China actually may have more equity capital raised in China than U.S for the first time I believe this year, [Indiscernible]. Do you think \u2013 and you also have leading share there, do you think you are \u2013 equity sides, so the opportunity there or are you and everyone else are just trying to catch up to the opportunity?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>David Viniar</strong><br><br>I think what you said is absolutely correct. If you look at the trends there is a chance that will happen. We've been talking about that being a big opportunity for long time. We think we have a pretty big competitive advantage there. We've been there for longer. We have a bigger presence than others. We'd like to be bigger. We're held back by making sure we can build the infrastructure and find the right people and other than that we're growing as fast as we think is prudent.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Steve Stelmach - FBR Capital Markets</strong><br><br>And then just putting a final point on global core access, you are carrying on a lot obviously, and you mentioned a little bit of it, but is it simply a functional of client activity and pending regulation or is this also sort of expressing a view of where opportunities are right now versus where you are expecting to be going forward over the next 12 to 18 months?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>David Viniar<br></strong><br>It's a combination of all of those things, but it's much more the former than the latter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Steve Stelmach - FBR Capital Markets</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Perfect. Thank you very much</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">You\u2019re welcome</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator<br></strong><br>Your next question comes from Richard Staite with Atlantic Equity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Richard Staite - Atlantic Equity</strong><br><br>Have you guys ever considered raising the dividend and if not, why not? My thinking around this is that, going forward if you're proprietary trading drops and your income becomes more stable, are you not in a better position to have a higher payout ratio?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>David Viniar</strong><br><br>We consider everything. We have generally over time felt that for us and for the types of shareholders that we have, if we were going to choose to return capital, that buying back shares is a better way to give it back to our shareholders, but that's not to say that we wouldn't raise our dividend going forward. There is nothing on the table right now, but we look and consider everything over time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Richard Staite - Atlantic Equity</strong><br><br>Okay, and a second question just in terms of your latest thinking on acquisitions. With [indiscernible] come in Asset Management, would you think there are other businesses you would consider?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>David Viniar</strong><br><br>Again, we have talked over time. We, as you know, have not made a lot of acquisitions over time. There aren't that many examples of successful acquisitions in the financial services industry and there is many more examples of unsuccessful one. It's hard to combine cultures. It's just a people business. We are not necessarily averse to own. If we found something that made sense we would think about it. We just haven't seen many over time that made sense for us. They might make sense for other people, but given our mix of businesses they haven't made sense for us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Richard Staite - Atlantic Equity</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay, great. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">You\u2019re welcome</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong><br><br>Your next question comes from Carole Berger with Soleil.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Carole Berger - Soleil Securities Group</strong><br><br>good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Good morning Carole?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Carole Berger - Soleil Securities Group</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">How are you David? Sometimes I get a little intense, so I'd like you to help me with this a little bit. When you talk about mitigation in regard to risk-weighted assets for your calculations, is it because there is sort of two ways to structure a transaction for a client, and therefore you might choose a less capital intensive way to do the business or is it because the capital required for some of these assets is so significant, it is no longer really an economic or doesn't meet the kind of hurdle returns you'd like in that business? So could you talk about how you would choose to change [Indiscernible] stuff?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>David Viniar</strong><br><br>What I was really talking about, it's partially the latter, that the capital requirements are too high, but it's also partially that occasionally you will find that we and others will have assets on our balance sheet. They aren't earning very much, aren't giving a lot of risk, but you might have offsetting assets or offsetting asset mobility a long and a short or a long with someone and a short with someone else, which completely mitigate the risk.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">When you put those trades on, you could have tried to just take off the first trade, but it was, maybe saved you a little bit of transaction expenses, maybe it was just easier to just put out an offsetting trade, and the capital charges were low enough that it was fine that you had those on your balance sheets. But you sit here today, and all of a sudden, the capital charges even though they may not have a lot of risk are quite high and you say, well, this doesn't make sense, let's work with counterparties on both sides to just tear up those trades, and you cannot affect risk very much, not affect revenues very much, but affect capital a fair amount.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So, that's really what I mean by more active mitigation. In some cases, you may say there are revenues, but the revenues just aren't worth the capital charges anymore and so that's another way. So it's either of those things really I was talking about.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Carole Berger - Soleil Securities Group<br><br></strong>Secondarily, given the fact that you are accruing comp at the lowest rate ever, do you still have the same kind of flexibility going into the fourth quarter that you would normally have?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>David Viniar<br><br></strong>I think, we've told you every quarter in our history that we accrue at where we think is reasonable at that time, but that the final comp numbers are determined at the end of the year, and it's hard to know until the end of the year where they are going to be. And it's going to be based on our competitive position, our actual earnings, the environment and many other things. So, I can't give you a lot more guidance than that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Carole Berger - Soleil Securities Group</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thank you</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong><br><br>Your next question comes from Roger Freeman with Barclays Capital.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Roger Freeman - Barclays Capital</strong><br><br>Hi David, just a couple of follow-ups. Is the reason that \u2013 just kind of go through \u2013 again, it's early, but the RWA calc under Basel III, is there a reason it maybe doesn't go down as much as for some of the other banks we have been hearing is just because so much of the higher RWA is charged back on the correlation book around the mortgage businesses. Since that wasn't as big for you, they are just not as much of an opportunity set for you to expand?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>David Viniar</strong><br><br>It's very hard for me to compare us to others, because I don't know what others have. I have seen headline numbers, but I never know what's in there. So I only know what our numbers are, but I don't know theirs. One possibility is, we do have a somewhat larger principal investment portfolio than others, and so I think some of those have higher risk-weighted assets under the new rules. As I said we have made no assumptions of any of that rolling off even though some of that is going to. So that might be one of the things that would help you to...</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Roger Freeman - Barclays Capital<br></strong><br>okay, and then just on this netting thing, I missed a little bit of what you said on the last question are you just talking about between dealer and dealer, sort of the capital benefits that you might get from tearing it up, as opposed to say between dealer and buy side?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>David Viniar</strong><br><br>Yeah.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Roger Freeman - Barclays Capital</strong><br><br>Okay, and is there any way to entice the buy side and how much of the split, do you think it's like half and half of the business is dealer versus buy side in terms of the swaps?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>David Viniar<br></strong><br>I think it's more dealer.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Roger Freeman - Barclays Capital</strong><br><br>More dealer?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>David Viniar</strong><br><br>Yeah.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Roger Freeman - Barclays Capital<br></strong><br>Okay. But given that there is no retroactive clearing requirement then there is really nothing you can do to push the buy side?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>David Viniar<br></strong><br>It's just a question of whether it's attractive enough for them.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Roger Freeman - Barclays Capital</strong><br><br>Okay, and then just lastly the FX VaR, so that was the biggest reason you're your VaR coming down and volatility obviously was down, but your revenues were up. Can you just talk a little bit to that dynamic? I guess in the second quarter was -- you were kind along Euros, right I think you had mentioned?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>David Viniar<br></strong><br>I don't think I mentioned that. I would not have been likely to say that. Again, just nothing specific that I would say of currencies versus anything else other than again lower activity levels, lower volatility across the board.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Roger Freeman - Barclays Capital</strong><br><br>But good trading environment I guess, your revenues were up?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>David Viniar<br></strong><br>Okay. When I say they were up, don't read a lot into that. It wasn't like it was a blowout quarter in any way, shape or form, in any business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Roger Freeman - Barclays Capital</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay, great. Thanks</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">You\u2019re welcome.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator<br></strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to management for any final remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Dane Holmes<br><br></strong>Thank you everyone for joining.

My name is Dennis, and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Fourth Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Mr. Holmes, you may begin your conference.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Dane Holmes</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Director of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. Today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm's belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain and outside of the firm's control. The firm's actual results and financial conditions may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in these forward-looking statements. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">For a discussion of some of the risk factors that could affect the firm's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our current annual report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended December 2009. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking, transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets and Global Core Excess. And you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that is posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com. This audiocast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Our Chief Financial Officer, David Viniar, will now review the firm's results. David?</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thanks, Dane. I'd like to thank all of you for listening today. I'll give an overview of our fourth quarter and full year results and then take your questions. My remarks today will be focused on our new segment disclosure that was discussed in our Business Standards Committee report. The Business Standards Committee evaluated the firm's public financial disclosures with the objective of improving our standards of transparency and disclosure by more clearly explaining business activities and performance and how they relate to serving our clients. The committee recommended changing the firm's three previous business segments into the following four business segments: Investment Banking, Institutional Client Services, Investing and Lending and Investment Management. The composition of the new four segments is described in greater detail in our 8-K dated January 11, 2011. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Full year and net revenues for 2010 were $39.2 billion. Net earnings were $8.4 billion, and earnings per diluted share were $13.18. These results generated an adjusted return of common equity of 13.1%, which is our reported return of common equity excluding the U.K. bank payroll tax, the SEC settlement and the impairment of our New York Stock Exchange Designated Market Maker rights. If these items are included, our return on common equity for 2010 was 11.5%. Over the past year, book value per share was up 10% to $128.72. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Fourth quarter net revenues were $8.6 billion. Net earnings were $2.4 billion and earnings per diluted share were $3.79. During 2010, market participants were faced with a series of broad macroeconomic concerns. European sovereign risk came under heightened scrutiny periodically during the year. Investors have also been intensely focused on the U.S. mortgage market regarding procedural concerns associated with home foreclosures and the potential for mortgage put back risk.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Throughout the year, global financial regulation continued to be a concern, specifically, the implications of the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III. Finally, the trajectory of the global economy was heavily debated, and there were growing fears about the potential for inflation in growth markets. The ultimate consequence of these concerns lead to greater risk aversions, a deterioration and conviction among institutional investors and thus, a steady decline in client activity. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">This reduction of client activity occurred across a broad set of businesses within Investment Banking and FICC and equities client execution. Despite the difficult economic backdrop and lower levels of client business, the firm produced a solid 13% adjusted return on common equity, which is a testament to the strength and breadth of our client franchise and the commitment of our people. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">I'll now review each of our businesses. Investment Banking produced fourth quarter net revenues of $1.5 billion, up 30% from the third quarter due to significant increases in Financial Advisory and Equity Underwriting revenues. For the full year, Investment Banking net revenues were $4.8 billion, down 3% from 2009, with a 9% improvement in Financial Advisory, partially mitigating an 11% decline in Underwriting. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Within Investment Banking, fourth quarter Advisory revenues were $628 million, up 26% from the third quarter. Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced and completed M&amp;A globally for calendar 2010. We advised on a number of important transactions that closed in the fourth quarter, including for Brookfield Asset Management, which led to $24 billion restructuring of general growth properties; E.On's $7.6 billion sale to PPL Corporation; and United Airlines' $6.5 billion merger with Continental Airlines. We're also adviser on a number of significant announced transactions including NSTAR's $17.5 billion merger of equals with Northeast Utilities; Earl Cully's $9.6 billion acquisition of Silvenate [ph] and Toronto-Dominion Bank's $6.3 billion acquisition of Chrysler Financial. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Fourth quarter Underwriting net revenues were $879 million, up 33% sequentially. Equity Underwriting revenues of $555 million were up 79% from the third quarter, reflecting a significant increase in IPO activity. Debt Underwriting decreased 7% to $324 million, reflecting lower activity in investment grade markets. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">During the fourth quarter, we participated in many noteworthy Underwriting transactions including AIA Group's $20.5 billion IPO, Renault's $4.2 billion sale of a portion its equity stake in Volvo, and Hutchison Whampoa's $2 billion investment-grade issuance. Our Investment Banking backlog decreased compared with the end of the third quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Let me now turn to Institutional Client Services, which is comprised of FICC and equities client execution, commissions and fees and Security Services. Net revenues were $3.6 billion in the fourth quarter. Net revenue generation within FICC and equities client execution declined significantly, as client activity leading into and through the holiday season was low and exacerbated by several macro concerns. Full year net revenues of $21.8 billion dollars for institutional client services were down 33% relative to 2009 on lower levels of client activity and tighter bid-offer spreads. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">FICC client execution net revenues were $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter, down 39% sequentially as client activity slowed meaningfully in the quarter. Credit and rates net revenues, our most significant FICC client execution businesses, were down as macro uncertainties led to lower customer activity levels and weaker revenues. Currencies and mortgages net revenues were also lower sequentially. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Commodity net revenues were up amid more favorable market conditions. For the full year, FICC client execution net revenues of $13.7 billion were down 37% from 2009 as macro uncertainty throughout the year drove lower client activity and led to tighter bid-offer spreads. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to Equities, which includes Equities client execution, commissions and fees and Security Services. Net revenues for the fourth quarter were $2 billion, up 1% sequentially. Equities client execution revenues were down 10% to $772 million, reflecting lower net revenues within our derivatives business. A slight improvement in market volumes and higher market values drove an 11% increase in commissions and fees. Security Services net revenues also increased sequentially by 7% to $368 million, reflecting higher average customer balances. For the full year, equities produced net revenues of $8.1 billion, down 25% from 2009 on lower market volumes in the U.S. and client activity levels across the franchise.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to Risk. Average daily value at Risk in the fourth quarter was $120 million, roughly flat with the third quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Let me now review Investing and Lending, which produced net revenues of $2 billion in the fourth quarter. The firm is investing in lending activities across various asset classes, primarily including debt securities and loans and equity securities, including private equity and real estate, are included in this segment. These activities include both direct investing and investing through fund as well as lending activities. Our investment in ICBC produced a $55 million gain in the quarter. Other equity investments generated net revenues of $1.1 billion across both public and private equity investments, and benefited from the significant increase in the equity markets. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Net revenues from our debt, investing and lending businesses were $537 million from interest income and tightening credit spreads throughout the quarter. Other revenues of $330 million were primarily produced by the firm's investment in consolidated investment entities. For the full year, Investing and Lending generated net revenues of $7.5 billion dollars, driven by $747 million in gains from our ICBC investment, $2.7 billion in gains from our other equity investments, $2.6 billion in revenue from our debt Investing and Lending businesses, and $1.5 billion from other investments. A significant increase in global equity markets and tighter credit spreads provided a favorable backdrop for our Investing and Lending businesses in 2010.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In Investment Management, we reported fourth quarter net revenues of $1.5 billion, up 18% from the third quarter due to higher Assets Under Management and $310 million in incentive fees generated across the firm's alternative asset products. For the full year, Investment Management net revenues were $5 billion, up 9% from 2009 due to a favorable change in the composition of assets managed and a significant increase in incentive fees.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">During the fourth quarter, assets under management grew $17 billion to $840 billion. The increase was driven by $5 billion of net inflows, reflecting money market inflows, as well as $12 billion in market appreciation. On a full-year basis, asset under management declined by 4%, mainly reflecting industry-wide outflows in money market assets. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior equity awards and other items such as benefits, was down 5% to $15.4 billion. This translated into a compensation to net revenue ratio of 39.3%, which is in excess of 600 basis points lower than our average compensation ratio between 2000 and 2009. When adjusted for the increase in headcount, compensation and benefits declined in line with the firm's overall revenue decline. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Fourth quarter non-compensation expenses were up 35% sequentially, largely in depreciation, amortization and other expenses. Depreciation and amortization increased significantly to $725 million, as the firm wrote down the value of our New York Stock Exchange Designated Market Maker rights by $305 million in the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">The increase in other expenses is primarily related to a $320 million donation to Goldman Sachs Gives, our donor-advised charitable fund. Compensation was reduced to fund this charitable contribution. As we discussed last year, GS Gives provides senior employees with a firm-sponsored mechanism for recommending charitable contributions. This effort will continue to be focused on those areas that have been proven to be fundamental to creating jobs and economic growth, building and stabilizing communities, honoring service and veterans and increasing educational opportunities. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">For the full year, non-compensation expenses were up 14%. In 2010, non-compensation expenses included the $550 million SEC settlement and the $305 million impairment of our New York Stock Exchange Designated Market Maker rights. Total staffs at the end fourth quarter was approximately 35,700, up 1% from the third quarter and up 10% versus year-end 2009. Our effective tax rate was 35.2% for the full year, resulting in $4.5 billion in tax expense. As you know, economic growth remains the key driver of our operating performance. As we have said in the past, a strong and growing global economic environment usually translates into greater activity among our client base and ultimately drives our business. The operating environment in 2010 was dominated by heightened uncertainty surrounding the global economic outlook, which contributed to a steady decline in activity levels over the course of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">While economic activity has improved in recent weeks, the seasonal nature of the fourth quarter, combined with the continued uncertainty surrounding the outlook, makes future activity levels difficult to predict. Longer-term, we remain optimistic about the opportunities that lie ahead for the firm. Our optimism is rooted in our belief that the firm will continue to expand with the growth of the global economy and the further development of the capital markets. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In addition, clients' demand for our advise and execution capabilities remains unchanged. As always, our global client franchise is essential to our success. We believe our fundamental recommitment to our clients and the primacy of their interest coming out of the Business Standards Committee report will further strengthen our existing client relationships and serve as the foundation to build new ones. We also remain committed to expanding our global franchise and footprint. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Even in a difficult macroeconomic environment, we've continued investing in our client franchise and in new market expansion. This commitment will enable the firm to continue its legacy of providing best in class service to our clients, best in class return to our shareholders, and attracting and retaining the best talent in a competitive global marketplace. With that, I'd like to thank you again for listening today, and I'm now happy to take your questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p4\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Your first question comes from the line Glenn Schorr with Nomura.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">So I hear your thoughts on the financial crisis commission. Look, you reset your disclosure to center around how activity is done for better clarity and I think we appreciate that. But without the rules being set, is there a chance that as the rules are written, some things that are in Investing and Lending are no longer permitted? Like, how do you think about how that business gets re-shaped as the rules get set?</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Well, the way you ask the question, Glenn, is there a chance that some things in Investing and Lending aren't permitted, the answer is yes. There's a chance that some things in Investing and Lending aren't permitted. We don't know what the rules are going to be yet. The report came out last night. We're still just going through it. So it's hard for me to give you a more definitive answer on the question. I mean, there's a lot of things in that segment that are basic lending to our clients. Some of our funds do nothing other than lend to our clients, some of it is investing alongside. And in our clients, which of those things are not going to be permitted? We're just not sure.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So I'm assuming that any Basel III changes, this is the segment that gets impacted the most by both rule changes and cap to risk weightings. Are we going to -- I guess on the 10-K, are we going to get equity and assets and P&amp;L by the new business segments? Is that wishful thinking?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">You're certainly going to get assets by the new business segments, and you're going to get P&amp;L by the new business segments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">And any chance we get a preview on the Investing and Lending side? I know that answer.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">If we had it, for sure. If we had it in a form that I was sure it wouldn't change, I'd give it to you. We'll try and get there in the future, but we're not there yet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Just the gross leverage is low. You're below 12x. You're below 13x if you just look at common. Curious on your thoughts on being able to move that a little bit higher. And I asked because in a so-so world this year, you produced almost a 100 basis points ROA. So a little bit more leverage and you actually have a decent return.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">It's really, honestly, it's a question of opportunities. We're not artificially holding that down. We just have not seen the opportunities to do things that would increase the leverage. If we see them, given the amount of capital we have, given the amount of liquidity we have, we would take advantage of them.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - UBS</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">And just so I'm clear, you can do it if you want to, meaning there's a couple of turns of leverage are within your operating ability.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">I think, yes, absolutely.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">On FICC during the quarter, I was wondering if you could give us a sense for how skewed the results were by month. And to what extent were either customer activity levels or just inventory valuations impacted by what happened in the muni market and in the interest rates market.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Let me do it in reverse order. The muni market, it's just not that big a part of our business. So it wasn't a positive for us, but it was a very immaterial negative to the firm. Look, it was really customer activity levels more than anything else. And while you know I don't like to talk about one month or another month, clearly, in the month of December, things were just dead. There was just very little activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">And turning back to some of the more principal activities in the Investing and Lending segment, you've had debt securities and lending revenue of about $500 million in the quarter and $2.6 billion in the year. I was hoping maybe you could better characterize that for us, maybe a little bit to Glenn's point about things that might or might not persist. I think investors really want to understand what types of revenue really are so lending driven that we could really anticipate that they would not necessarily be affected by Dodd-Frank, by Volcker Rules.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">There's two things in there. We're going to have to get back to you with the exact breakdown. One, you know we mark everything to market. We mark our loans to market. So if we lend to someone and their spreads widen, we mark them down. If their spreads narrow, we mark them up, because we mark everything we have to market, loans, loan commitments. Everything is mark-to-market at Goldman Sachs. So that mark-to-market is in there, and interest income is in there as well. So we lend to people. They pay us interest, and that revenue is in there as well. So those two things are both in there on the debt securities side.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Yes, again, there is just some aspect of some of that, that are more likely to persist, we can assume, than others but obviously, there's a lot of rule writing in front of us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On the equity securities side, within that Investing and Lending segment, I mean, we know that private equity and real estate, as you said, are in there. Where would we find things that we thought of more as prop equity such as GSPS and statistical arbitrage?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Anything that you would consider prop trading would be in the other line in Investing and Lending. And most of that line is our consolidated investment entities, which really are revenues which we have to take because of the accounting and they're really largely offset by expenses. So anything that you would consider as prop trading would be within the other, and it would not be the bulk of other.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">And again, you say that the revenues that we see there is the revenue that's net of the direct expense load.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">No, it's not net. It's divested gross number, the expenses within expenses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">And in terms of the equity revenues that we saw for the year in the quarter, the equities security, excluding ICBC, can you give us a sense of in the quarter in particular for how much of that was realized gains versus marks and a sense for the concentration in particular positions?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Well, it's not heavily concentrated. It's quite broad. I would tell you it was roughly equal between public securities and private securities, and I mean, I have to get back to you on the private securities, how much was realized and how much wasn't. That I don't have off hand.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">In comp, was there any significant change in the cash equity mix for the year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Not really significant.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">And was there a significant increase in the stock amortization component for the year relative to what there was last year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">I don't think it was that meaningfully different.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Your next question comes from the line of Howard Chen with Credit Suisse.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On FICC, you noted the lower client activity and the macro concerns a few times, but I was just hoping that you could touch on the competitive landscape and how you think the firm's market share has potentially evolved over recent quarters?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Across the full year, the competitive landscape got much tougher. And this was not a surprise, and we talked about it in the past. Certainly, in the early part of 2009, our competitors were hurt probably more than we were financially, were much less willing to commit risk capital on behalf of clients than we were. We picked up quite a lot of market share. I think we've told you through last year, we did not expect that, that market share would stay. I think we've kept a small amount of it, but our competitors are stronger financially.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">And then switching gears, as we're in the middle of a rule making process specifically for derivatives reform, we're just hoping you could provide some initial thoughts on the recent proposals we've seen such as those for swap execution facilities, et cetera.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">I think it's just too early for me to give you much. A whole big report came out last night, yesterday afternoon, we're still reading through it. And as we understand it better, we'll get back to you on it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">And then the firm purchased some stock again this quarter to offset the share issuance. But how should we be thinking about potentially upsizing that to potentially just doing more than just offsetting share issuance? Clearly, you gave us a lot of detail on Basel III and the pro forma ratios last quarter. And it looks like as all the other banks have kind of taken your lead, that you guys sit at the high end of capital for the group.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">I think we are -- we're going to see how the world unfolds. We're going to get -- see how the rules are ultimately written, and then we'll see how that all plays out with our capital ratios. If we remain this elevated, hopefully, we'll find -- our number one choice would be to find opportunities to use the capital profitably. And if not, we will probably give some more back.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Just any impact of DVA this quarter, David?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Yes, it was pretty small. There was about $120 million loss and about, I think, three quarters of that was in FICC.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Your next question comes from the line Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Christoph Kotowski - Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">I mean in looking at the Investing and Lending line, the activities that would conceivably be disallowed going forward, I guess, my question is to what extent can you do all that in fund of vehicles? And is it the same from a client perspective and the internal process perspective? In the past, you just used to be able to write a check from your own balance sheet. Now you're going to have to do it through a fund vehicle, where you presumably you have fiduciary duties to the investors and all that. Does it change your relationship with the corporate clients to morph your business model in the way that these regs are going to force you to?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">I would actually say it a little differently. Most of the investing we have done over time has been through funds. There's been some on our balance sheet but most of it has been through funds. I think one thing we know the rules do, it limits the percentage we can have in the funds to 3%. We have traditionally had more than that in the funds. We're going to have to have smaller percentages than we've had in the past. We'll still have some money, so our clients will know that we're there. But I think the most important thing for our clients is that we are still going to use our franchise to find the opportunities which is what we've done in the past for the funds. And so I think the biggest difference is going to be we know we have to have a smaller percentage of our own capital in those funds going forward. Other than that, we expect we will operate similarly, using the franchise to help source opportunities for our clients with some small amount of coinvestment by the firm and the funds.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Christoph Kotowski - Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Now another bank that reported earlier today kind of referenced that they were hoping for a 25% or 30% payout of their earnings. I mean, whatever it is, whatever the regulators give the banks, fine. If taking capital out of this investing and lending line freeze up additional capital, above and beyond, is it your understanding that you're able to use that to retire a stock, or does it all get driven by this percentage of earnings ratio that the fed is talking about, at 30%?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">I think, over time, as long as we have sufficient capital ratios and a sufficiently robust capital plan going forward, we should be able to manage our capital prudently.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Christoph Kotowski - Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And in terms of buyback versus dividends, you've clearly tilted more towards buybacks rather than dividends, right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">We have generally been tilted more towards buybacks than dividends. Not one at the exclusion of the other, but more tilted towards buybacks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Christoph Kotowski - Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And then finally, was there an impact or can you gauge what is the impact of the sheer rise in U.S. bond rates in the course of the fourth quarter? It was a pretty violent decline in treasury bond prices during the period. And to what extent was that a factor in the weak FICC trading results?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">I think it was a factor in that the extent and, as you say, the violence of the move especially coming when it did as we were getting towards the end of the year, caused even more uncertainty and caused more clients to sit on the side and say, \"Let's wait till the year-end. Let's see how things unfold and call me in January.\"</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Christoph Kotowski - Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">But not necessarily positioning losses as in the course of market making activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">No, nothing material. It was much more client-activity driven.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question comes from the line Roger Freeman with Barclays Capital.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Roger Freeman - Barclays Capital</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I guess just on the topic of sort of reduced client activity, I'm just wondering how much do you think that your businesses are impacted by externalities, for example, like concern around OTC regulation? Because otherwise, it seems like we're in a fairly robust GDP environment, a barely normalized capital markets environment, certainly Investment Banking. A lot of trading, plus or minus certain segments. And I'm just wondering if you think that we're in an unusually slow period here that may be driven by customers shifting to maybe more listed, liquid products or cash instruments that are less profitable.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I didn't say we were in an unusually slow period. I said we had an unusually slow period in the quarter because they're different. And I think external events actually affect client philosophy a lot and client psychology and therefore, their willingness to take risk and their willingness to do things. I think some of the things that we saw over the course of the year when you had as you said, some concerns about regulation but also about Europe, about inflation, about many other things caused people to be very unsure. Even though we basically had a year where for the most part, asset prices kept going up, it was not a year where anyone felt confident asset prices were going to keep going up. And so I think that caused a lot of people to sit on the side line.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Roger Freeman - Barclays Capital</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Would you think like, for example, in the commodities business like energy and CDS, are those businesses, do you think, being impacted by clients not wanting to trade OTC products, given the pending regulatory reform? Because it seems like that -- we've heard that, and I'm just curious of your view.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I think that there is more focus on cash products than derivative products right now partially because of the concern of uncertainty around regulation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Roger Freeman - Barclays Capital</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And then as you think about your sort of the longer-term, you've touched on this a little bit with some prior questions. Sort of longer-term return expectations, say over the next three years, right, ROE expansion, if you were to rank growing top line, reducing comp expense structurally further or reducing the equity investment of the business, how would you rank how those are going to contribute to rising ROE, particularly relative to your 20% cross-cycle target?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I always think the most important thing in growing ROE is growing the top line. That's what's going to drive the business over time. We're not going to cut expenses to being a successful firm over time. You might do it in a year, where we don't perform as well, we'll cut our comp. We've told you that. But, over time, what is going to drive the business at Goldman Sachs, what's going to drive the returns to our shareholders is growing our top line revenue.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Roger Freeman - Barclays Capital</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So what do you think is really missing right now? I mean, obviously, derivatives is a slow part. But what do you think is holding back that greater revenue producing capability?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I think what we need, really, is conviction on the part of our customers and clients, some more level of conviction and therefore, wanting to really be active in the markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Roger Freeman - Barclays Capital</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your liquidity position is still pretty high. I think we've talked last quarter a lot of that is -- or a decent amount of that is sitting in treasuries. I mean how should we think about that, given that treasuries could be a negative returning asset class?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">It's a drag on our return. There is no question, having all of that liquidity is a drag on our return. As you heard me say, we think about everything in terms of risk and reward. And we think right now, the risk of having too much cash and having somewhat lower returns versus not having enough is very skewed towards having too much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Richard Staite - Atlantic Equities LLP</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Does that show up in FICC or is that across the P&amp;L?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">It's really across our inventory, but more of our inventory would be in FICC, some more of that would be affected.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Harte with Sandler O'Neill.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Jeffrey Harte - Sandler O'Neill &amp; Partners L.P.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">You mentioned Investment Banking pipeline being down. It seems like there's still a lot of kind of client conversations going on out there. Can you give us a little color as to what you're seeing as far as client conversations go? And I'd be kind of interested in, regionally, is Asia still where a lot of the equity is coming from? And then even kind of within Equity, are we continuing to move away from kind of bank recaps into non-financial demand for equity?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Here's what I'd say: One, you always have to be careful when we talk about the backlog. We tell you what it is. Backlog is probability weighted revenues that we're going to get. But things like backlog is probably a reasonably good indicator when you're talking about merger deals, because they take a long time to go through backlog. It's not necessarily a good indicator on equity and fixed income because many of those come up quickly, get executed quickly. Many of those come up and get executed within the quarter. So it's not necessarily that good an indicator. But I think in a way, you answered much of your own question. There's still a lot of dialogue. I think in keeping with the answer I just gave, if there was more conviction, I think you'd see even more activity. So there's a lot of dialogues, some of which turns into deals, some of which doesn't. And I think the equity markets continued to be pretty good and pretty receptive, and the debt markets as well. So I think you'll see some more issuing activity, and I think you're going to see a lot of it coming out of Asia, as you've seen in the past.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Jeffrey Harte - Sandler O'Neill &amp; Partners L.P.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">What do you think it takes to move the conviction toward more deals getting done?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I think you need final certainly around regulatory reform, some people feeling a little bit better about how things are going to unfold in peripheral Europe, and I think a little more confidence around inflation in the market. I think you're seeing, really, certainly in the U.S., pretty positive economic data. So I think if that continues, I think that will help as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Jeffrey Harte - Sandler O'Neill &amp; Partners L.P.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And I guess, finally, any of us on the banking side thinking about kind of Debt Underwriting, I mean, we've come from some very strong activity levels, a lot of pre-funding. How do you think about the kind of macro demand or even supply-side for Debt Underwriting, given how strong the last couple years have been?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I think there's still plenty of demand. If economic activity picks up, there will be plenty of demand for Underwriting.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Jeffrey Harte - Sandler O'Neill &amp; Partners L.P.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And then, quickly, you mentioned, when talking about client risk appetites, call me in January, how are you seeing risk appetites pick up year-to-date? And it's anybody's guess, I guess, but how are you kind of looking forward in 2011 as well?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Again, you answered it well. It's anybody's guess. You know I don't like to look forward. And 2 1/2 weeks don't tell you a whole lot. And I wouldn't say it's the best period we've ever seen, but it's sure a lot more active than December.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question comes from the line Kian Abouhossein with JP Morgan.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I have a question on more looking at staff hirings and staff levels that we should look at going forward. How should we think about that for 2011? And in what regions or businesses would you expect staffing levels to increase?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I would expect, subject to the economic environment not changing very dramatically. I would expect we will continue to grow our staff. And it will be more focused on the growth markets than anywhere else with some growth in other places as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And in terms of business segments, is there any focus as well, specific focus?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I would say there's probably more focus on the Investment Management division than other places. But again, we would expect all the businesses to grow somewhat.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And should we think about the staff increases in line with what we saw in 2010 relative to '09?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I would say somewhere in the mid-to-high single digits is what I would expect. But I'm almost certainly going to be wrong either high or low by the time we get to the end of the year. But as we sit here today, that's what I would tell you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And if I look at the FSOC [Financial Stability Oversight Council] study that came out last night, it seems to me they do give some exact details of metrics that one should look at in order to determine prop trading. And I was wondering how you think about these, because some of them to me seem to be realistic, some of them questionable, if they make really any impact or really realistic to assess risk?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I don't think we've had enough time to really go through it in enough detail for me to respond.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And in terms of Basel 2.5 and III, is there a possibility to give the risk weighted asset breakdown between Basel 2.5, and how much it would be for Basel III now that we have the final rules?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I'm sure the answer to that question is yes. We're going to have to get back to you. I don't have that breakdown with me right now. So we can get that to you though.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">What would FICC have been under your old reporting?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Because we're not doing our old reporting, I don't have that. But we can calculate it and get back to you. I'm going to guess, Mike, it would have been in the range of $2.5 billion, but we'll get you the exact number.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And you've kind of alluded to it being a little bit worse than I think what you might have expected. You said December was dead, and the rise in the U.S. bond rates. How much of the lower than typical level was due to structural changes or regulatory changes?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">It's impossible for me to answer that question. I don't know why people were really sitting on the side line. There was a lot of uncertainty. I don't think most of it was due to structural changes. I think people are -- you've heard me say this before, I think when we're through with all the regulatory changes, people are still going to need the same things they needed before. So I don't think much of it was because of that, but it's hard for me to answer the question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And the cyclical part of the decline, the rise in U.S. bond rates, you said things have picked up here so far in January. Is that because rates are stabilized, or what are some of the factors behind that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I think that there was so much uncertainty. Traditionally, things get slower at the end of the year. There was so much uncertainty in the macro environment, that it got even slower than usual. And as you get to the new year, people come back and are wanting to be more active.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Shifting gears, the percentage of revenues outside the U.S. versus in the U.S. and linked quarter changes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">We've been running pretty much in the mid-50s in the U.S., and mid-40s outside the U.S.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And how are the growth rates to the recent quarter, U.S. versus non-U.S.?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">It was right around there. Right around there, it's right around there pretty much for the whole year. I said mid-to-high 50s in the U.S., mid-to-low 40s outside the U.S., probably that being in the range of 60-40, Europe, Asia, outside U.S. And those changed by a few percent quarter-over-quarter. But it's not all that meaningful when I give you a couple of percent change, because you have a U.S. client doing an Asian acquisition or an Asian client do a U.S. equity offering or a global booking in foreign exchange that moves around the world. So those are the rough numbers. They haven't changed very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And as it relates to just activity levels, are you seeing any incremental pickup or decline in, say, Asia versus Europe versus the U.S.?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">No.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And then last question, Facebook was in the news. We got the press release a couple days ago. Do you want to comment on what happened there? I think it's pretty clear, except the only question is since this was such a high-profile deal, wouldn't it be expected that it would become public? And what was your thought process behind that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I have nothing to add other than the statement we've already made.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Security.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Matthew Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">In terms of the Asset Management net flows in the quarter, those were negative both in alternative investments and in equity. One of your competitors showed at least positive numbers for equity. Can you give us a little sense as to what was going on at least on the equity side of the inflows in the quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">There is really nothing special there. You can see while there were net outflows, they were quite small. So there was nothing special in there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Matthew Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And in terms of the CVA and DVA, sorry to get so specific on this, but where in the new reporting, where do those -- should we expect those numbers to reside going forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">They'll be mainly in the Institutional Client Services section.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Matthew Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Just thinking about China, we've seen a number of competitors start or move from one form of business opportunity there into another. Do you think that, that's -- is there an increase in competition from non-Chinese competitors in that business? And does that imply that there could be some margin reduction in that business over time?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">No doubt that there's an increase in competition. And there's going to continue to be an increase in competition. I actually generally assume there will be an increase in competition in all of our businesses everywhere in the world, all the time. We had a multi-year start on our presence in China, along with one other firm. We knew other firms were going to get there, and think they're getting there now. And I think that will lead to more competition and likely, over time, it'll take a while, that will lead to lower margins. And I think generally what happens is as that happens though, it is offset by a dramatic increase in volumes. As their markets continue to grow, I think their capital markets will continue to grow. The growth rate in China is expected to be pretty high, and so I think the volume of activity will pick up many more times and decrease in margins.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Matthew Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Just switching gears in terms of S&amp;P's recent commentary on U.S. bank ratings, including some commentary about their view of investment banks being a bit riskier than a traditional commercial bank, have you updated your thinking about how you're intending on maintaining your current ratings?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I would tell you, we do not share their view.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Matthew Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And is that largely due to your capital position and liquidity?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I'll just leave it at we don't share their view. As you saw, they kept their ratings stable. Their most recent report on us talked about our risk management, our capital and all those other things. And our expectation is that our ratings will reflect our performance going forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question comes from the line Richard Bove with Rochdale Securities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Richard Bove - Punk Ziegel</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I'd like to ask a minor question and a major question. The minor question is the principal transactions line in the standard balance sheet, how does that relate to the Lending and Investment line that you now have? In other words, is 100% of that part of the Lending and Investing line, or is there some difference between the two?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I'm sorry, which part?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Richard Bove - Punk Ziegel</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Of the principal transactions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Principal transactions. Dick, I'm sorry, I'm not sure where you're looking.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Richard Bove - Punk Ziegel</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">If you take a look at the income statement, you've broken principal transactions into market making, which is presumably your services for third parties and other principal transactions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">The other principal transactions line, that is primarily Investing and Lending.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Richard Bove - Punk Ziegel</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">The larger question is, I think what everybody's try to get at is, has there been a lack of customer conviction in the last six months in the marketplace, or has there been a structural change in the marketplace which has got nothing to do with invested conviction? And I would point to the commercial paper market for asset-backed securities, which at the peak was $1.2 trillion in size and now is 1/3 that in size. It is unlikely to get back to $1.2 trillion, because there isn't any major housing market out there. There isn't any major ferment in [ph] CDOs squared or CDOs cubed, et cetera. So where in the structure of the financial sector, as we see it, are there product lines that could in fact come back to replace what I would consider to be a structural decline in a market like that? And I'm applying that to all financial markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Clearly, there have been some structural changes in certain parts of the market. The real question is are they permanent? Are they temporary? I don't happen to believe most things are permanent. When you look over time at financial markets, things get created. Sometimes they stay, sometimes they get out of fashion and other things get created to replace them. There's going to be a housing market in the United States. In order to have a housing market in the United States, you need mortgages and you need financing for those mortgages. That's not going to go away. Is it going to be the same type of securitizations that we saw in 2006 and 2007? Probably not for some period of time. I wouldn't say not forever but certainly, not for some period of time. But is there going to be something to replace them to allow that market to go on? Yes, there's going to be something. I don't know what's going to be yet. So it's a really tough question to answer. Some products that were in favor are now out of favor, and are likely to stay out of favor for at least some period of time, but other products will be developed to replace them</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question comes from the line of David Trone with JMP Securities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>David Trone - JMP Securities LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">On the FICC question, which I guess is getting a little old at this point, but if you look at the sequential declines since the first quarter of '10, it's been pretty steadily downward. And you mentioned there's a pickup here so far. Do you think it's just the seasonal factor? Or do you think there's really a -- like how robust do you think the client conviction recovery could be here in the first quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I don't want to overstate it. We're two weeks into the quarter, so anything can happen. All I can tell you is there has been a pickup from the fourth quarter to the first quarter so far. It could change.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>David Trone - JMP Securities LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">How about in the European credit markets?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I think there's just been a pickup of activity everywhere but again, it's just two weeks. I don't want to overstate that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>David Trone - JMP Securities LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Do you think that area has the biggest potential -- that was particularly weak, I suppose, right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I think there are still a lot of concerns about what the ultimate resolution is going to be in Europe. I think that's one of the things that's weighing on people's conviction. I think it's one of the things that weighed on activity throughout the entire 2010.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>David Trone - JMP Securities LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Switching gears, the adjusted comp ratio, again, you're below 40% for the year. And I assume, given the increase in deferred comp over the last few years, you have some -- a wave of tranche vesting coming, which will impact the expense, the comp expense. How do you think about that going forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">There's two things I would say. We don't target a ratio. You've heard me say this before. We pay our people fairly based on their performance, based on the firm's performance, the individual performance. And again, I'm going to say, some of you have heard me say before, we look at compensation based on our performance, the competitive environment, the external environment. We take all those things in consideration, and we paid what we paid this year, I can't tell you what it's going to be next year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>David Trone - JMP Securities LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Is it reasonable to assume that all else being equal, the vesting -- the increase in deferred comp, as it vests, would be an upward pressure?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I'm not sure there's going to be that much of an increase going forward versus where we've been. We've always used a lot of equity. It's always been pretty high.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question comes from the line Steven Wharton with JP Morgan.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Steven Wharton - JP Morgan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">It goes back to this question that everybody's wondering about, how much of this is just a temporary lull in activity due to client uncertainty and how much could be more structural? I guess my question is that when you gave your headcount outlook, I think you indicated you'd be up this year, assuming you budgeted for that. Yet historically, when you've gone into these periods of weak activity, you've seen the brokers cut back sometimes on headcount. So does this reflect your confidence, I guess, that this is temporary in nature? And at what point do you kind of think about, well, because of whether all these regulatory changes or other factors, we need to kind of re-evaluate the amount of heads that we have?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>David Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Two things I'd say, Steve: First of all, I talked about the fact that a reasonable amount of that is expected to be in the growth markets. That's investment for the long-term. We think it's important for the long-term success of the firm. It might not result in revenues very quickly, but we think over time, it will be the best thing for us and our returns and our shareholders. But the second thing I would say is if activity levels stayed where they were in the fourth quarter for a protracted period of time, we wouldn't be growing our headcount. We don't think that's going to happen. We think it was largely a seasonal fourth quarter event, but I can't tell you for sure. You know I don't like to make predictions, and so we'd have to see it. And remember, I said that -- I prefaced my comment on saying that I thought it would be mid-to-high single digits, with assuming there was no dramatic change in the economic environment. If there is, then I think that number will change.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I will now turn the call back to management for any closing remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Dane Holmes</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Thank you, everyone, for joining on our fourth quarter earnings call.

I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs First Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call.  [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Holmes, you may begin your conference.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Dane Holmes</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Director of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our First Quarter Earnings Conference Call.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm's belief regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain and outside of the firm's control. The firm's actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our current annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 2010.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets and Global Core Excess. And you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that is pointed on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">This audiocast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent. Our Chief Financial Officer, David Viniar, will now review the firm's results. David?</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thanks, Dane. I'd like to thank all of you for listening today. I'll give an overview of our first quarter results and then take your questions. I'm pleased to report solid first quarter results for the firm. Net revenues were $11.9 billion and net earnings were $2.7 billion. Earnings per diluted share were $1.56, and our annualized return on common equity was 12.2%. Excluding the impact of a $1.6 billion preferred dividend associated with our repayment of the Berkshire Hathaway preferred stock, earnings per diluted share were $4.38, and our annualized return to common equity was 14.5%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">In 2010, many of our clients' strategic and investment decisions were burdened by fears about the global economic outlook. These concerns were focused on many considerations ranging from European sovereign risk to regulatory uncertainty to the potential for inflation in growth markets. Many of the issues facing the broader operating environment in 2010 continued into 2011, with political unrest in the Middle East and the tragedy in Japan adding to their list of concerns.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Despite these broad macro concerns, we experienced increased client activity across many of our businesses within Institutional Client Services during the first quarter, although volumes were still generally subdued. In part reflecting a typical seasonal upswing, we saw improved client activity in each of the major businesses within FICC client execution in addition to higher volumes across equities as reflected in equities client execution and commissions and fees.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Throughout the challenging operating environment in the past few years, our people have remained focused on helping our clients navigate complex problems and making difficult decisions. The increased activity that we experienced during the first quarter of 2011 reflects our continual investment in the firm's global client franchise. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Another driver of our performance in the first quarter was the increase in asset prices despite the uncertain macroeconomic backdrop, which contributed to greater quarterly revenues in our Investing and Lending segment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">On March 18, we announced that we would redeem the 10% Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock held by Berkshire Hathaway. Following a 30-day notice period, we completed the full redemption yesterday. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">The depth and breadth of our client franchise positioned the firm to generate solid first quarter results despite our conservative leverage profile and near record levels of liquidity, amidst continued global economic uncertainty. I'll now review each of our businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Investment Banking produced first quarter net revenues of $1.3 billion, down 16% from solid fourth quarter results. First quarter advisory revenues were $357 million, down 43% from the fourth quarter. We advised on a number of important transactions to close in the first quarter, including GDF Suez's $25.4 billion merger with International Power, Allegheny Energy's $8.9 billion sale to FirstEnergy Corp. and Intel's $7.7 billion acquisition of McAfee. We're also adviser on a number of significant announced transactions, including Reliance Industries' $9 billion sale of certain assets to BP, Beckman-Coulter's $6.8 billion sale to Danaher and Liberty Global's $5.5 billion acquisition of KBW.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">First quarter Underwriting net revenues were $912 million, up 4% sequentially. Equity underwriting revenues of $426 million were down 23% from the fourth quarter, reflecting a decline in IPR activity from robust fourth quarter levels. Debt underwriting increased 50% to $486 million, reflecting higher activity across leveraged finance and investment grade markets and a reopening of the CMBS market.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">During the first quarter, we participated in many noteworthy underwriting transactions, including Hutchinson Port Holdings' $5.5 billion IPO, Schaeffler's $2.5 billion sale of a portion of its equity stake in Continental and J.Crew's $1.9 billion combination bank debt and high yield notes offering. Goldman Sachs ranked first globally in equity and equity-related offerings year-to-date. Our Investment Banking backlog increased from year-end levels.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Let me now turn to Institutional Client Services, which is comprised of FICC and Equities Client Execution, Commissions and Fees and Securities Services. Net revenues were $6.6 billion in the first quarter. Our FICC and Equities client execution business improved significantly from fourth quarter levels, driven by a broad-based increase in client activity. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">FICC client execution net revenues were $4.3 billion in the first quarter, more than doubling sequentially as every major business generated higher revenues. This quarter results were quite balanced with a broad contribution across products and regions. Our Credit business benefited from higher origination activity, particularly in high-yield markets. Mortgages produced solid results on improved volumes, largely in our Non-Agency business. Our macro complex, including rates, FX and commodities produced solid results as clients reacted to continued uncertainty in the macroeconomic outlook.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Turning to Equities, which includes Equities Client Execution, Commissions and Fees and Securities Services. Net revenues for the first quarter were $2.3 billion, up 16% sequentially. Equities Client Execution revenues were up 27% to $979 million, reflecting higher net revenues within our derivatives business. Commissions and Fees were $971 million, up 13% from the fourth quarter on higher market volumes. Securities Services net revenues of $372 million were roughly flat. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to risk, average daily value at risk for the first quarter was $113 million, down 6% relative to the fourth quarter. Lower equity and currency risk was partially offset by higher commodity risk.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Let me now review Investing and Lending, which produced net revenues of $2.7 billion in the first quarter. The firm's investing and lending activities across various asset classes, primarily including debt securities and loans and equities securities are included in this segment. These activities include both direct investing and investing through funds, as well as lending activities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Our investment in ICBC produced a $316 million gain in the quarter. Other equity investments generated net revenues of $1.1 billion across both public and private equity investment. Net revenues and debt securities and loans were $1 billion, generated from interest income and a favorable credit market. Other revenues of $311 million were primarily driven by the firm's investment in consolidated investment entities. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In Investment Management, we reported first quarter net revenues of $1.3 billion, down 16% from the fourth quarter due to seasonally lower incentive fees. Management and other fees were consistent with the fourth quarter at $1 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">During the first quarter, assets under management remained unchanged. Outflows in money market and fixed income assets were offset by $12 billion of market appreciation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior-year equity awards and other items such as payroll taxes and benefits was accrued at a compensation of net revenue ratio of 44%. First quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.6 billion. Depreciation and amortization expenses included impairment charges of approximately $220 million related to assets classified as held for sale during the first quarter, primarily related for Litton Loan Servicing. Total staff at the end of the first quarter was approximately 35,400, down 1% from the end of 2010. Our effective tax rate was 32.3% for the first quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In keeping with the firm's long-standing policy of repurchasing shares to offset increases in share count over time resulting from employee share-based compensation, we repurchased 9 million shares of common stock during the first quarter for a total cost of approximately $1.5 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Many headwinds continued to exist for our global businesses, particularly on the macroeconomic front. This leads to a natural ebb and flow of client activity. As a result, the firm continues to operate in an uncertain environment over the near term. However, we believe our ability to generate industry-leading returns for our shareholders remains intact. We remain committed to building and maintaining valued long-term relationships with our clients. We remain committed to managing our risk prudently and appropriately, balancing risk/return decisions. We remain committed to creating long-term value through continued investments in our global footprint, technology and operational infrastructure. And finally, we remain committed to recruiting and retaining individuals who embrace our culture of teamwork and client focus.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We understand the importance of these commitments not only to our shareholders but also to our clients, our regulators, our employees and the public at large. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">With that, I'd to thank you again for listening today, and I'm now happy to take your questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p3\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Nomura.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">So David, to your last point, 14.5% ROE on a pretty low leverage, lower obviously than you've been, but lower than all your peers as well. What do you think holds back picking up leverage a couple of clicks? Is it the CCAR [ph] buffer? Is it opportunity? Because it can be pretty impactful at this level of an ROE?</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">I think I'd start with opportunities. We're not holding back leverage. They're just -- while there was obviously more activity than the fourth quarter, our clients are still cautious given the economic environment, the regulatory environment, other things. And so they are just are not -- we're taking advantage of opportunities where we see them with our clients. But there aren't that many.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">And what can you tell us -- I think you gave us on the K, the size of the Investing and Lending balance sheet. But I think the returns on the debt side are harder to track. You gave us good 10% market guidance on the Equities side. How big is the balance sheet on the debt securities side, and how much of the gain this quarter was credit improvement versus anything else?</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Well, let me answer the second part of the question first. The gains were a variety of things. First of all, there's interest. We make loans and I would say, somewhere between 20% and 25% is interest. Then it was a combination of things. As you know, it was a very active financing market. So there were a lot of restructurings during the quarter. There were a lot of repayments during the quarter, and given that we're a mark-to-market firm, if something is repaid at par and it wasn't marked at par, we have gains. So there was just a lot of debt activity, which is beneficial, and then there was a narrowing of spreads as well [indiscernible]. So all of those things contributed to the gains in that segment. As far as the balance sheet goes -- how about if we just get back to you? I just don't have those numbers at my fingers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Not a problem. One last one. So FICC was obviously good and much improved from last quarter. But in the last couple of years, down from '09's highs. Is that, once again, an issue of client activity and the lower leverage? What can you tell us about bid/offer compression as well?</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Sure. Now as you remember, in 2009 and 2010, when we talked about it, I told you those weren't -- what was going on in the markets then were not sustainable. I think a very big portion of it was a bid/offer spread and the fact that there was just so little capital in the market to service our clients. And we were there and most others were not. And so we had an incredibly high market share, an unsustainably high market share with unsustainably high bid/offer spreads. And so, I think, that market share has come back down to, what I would call -- and I don't like using the word normal, a more normalized level, and bid/offer spreads have come down to a more normalized level.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Okay, thanks, David.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">You're welcome.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Your next question comes from the line of Howard Chen with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">David, you noted Institutional Client Services results were fairly balanced by region. I was just hoping you could expand on that. For some of your peers, we've seen Europe as a relative source of rebound and wondering if you're seeing something different.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Well, I think what I said was Institutional Client Services were balanced by business. And so within the FICC businesses, all the five major businesses were quite balanced. As far as region goes, I would say that overall, our revenues were pretty much in line with what you've seen, mid- to high-50s for the U.S. And outside the U.S., roughly 60%, 40%, Europe, Asia. So not a big change there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Great, very helpful. And then post the CCAR results, you noted the Fed had no objection to you repurchasing stock and a potential increase in the dividend. And I realize your preference would be to organically deploy that capital and you just repaid a big preferred. But could you just give us a sense of what your regulator was comfortable with you, buying back or raising the dividend by?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">I'm not going to give the numbers, but we continue to work with the regulators and return capital. And we think it's prudent. As you said, we prefer to use it, we prefer to find opportunities to put it to work. But if not, we'll give it back to our shareholders in a way that we think is prudent, given the opportunities that we think are out there and given the financial standing of the firm.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Okay, thanks. And then final one for me. Just could you update us on thoughts on pro forma Basel III, capital ratios and where you are in some of your RWA mitigation efforts? I know it's early. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Yes, it's early. Again, really no change. If we were to do it now at the end of the quarter, our Basel III ratios would be Basel III common. Tier 1 common would be just around 8%. And if we roll it out to the end of 2012 and we assume just consensus earnings and just passive mitigations, things that roll off would be at around 11%, right around. That hasn't changed. And as far as doing anything active, it's too soon to really do it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Okay, thanks. Many thanks for taking the question, David.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">No problem.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Just to dig in to Investing and Lending a little bit, I was wondering if for both the debt and the equity areas, maybe you could give us a sense of the concentration of revenues in terms of whether a handful of positions contributed to either equity or debt? Or whether it was more diversified than that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">It was both. There were a couple of things that were pretty meaningful, but it was also very, very diversified. There were tens and sometimes triple digits of positions that participated in the gains, in both debt and equity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">And when you say there were a couple that were meaningful, what's your definition of meaningful within, say, $1 billion revenue item?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Low-triple digits.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Okay, that's helpful, thanks. And then just in terms of the geographic spread within the equity and the fixed income segment sort of to piggyback on Howard's question? And again, I'm within Investing -- I'm talking about Investing and Lending.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">[indiscernible]  Across all of our businesses. And again, I should have given the caveat, which I always give you, that it's a little hard to do things geographically because we have global books, and so you hand off from one region to another. And then when you have a crossboard of merger, if the deal has a U.S. acquirer of a Chinese company. Is that a U.S. deal or an Asian deal? So there's question where things are, but I'd say it's relatively consistent across our businesses. High-50s in the U.S., and then roughly -- mid- to high-50s in the U.S. and then 60%, 40%, Europe, Asia, outside the U.S.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So that still applies largely with respect to the Investing and Lending segment as well? Because that's where I meant to ask the question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Guy, again, I'd have to get back to you to look at that segment specifically. I know it's the case generally across our businesses, segment by segment. I'd have to get back to you on that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Okay, that would be great. Can you give us a sense -- I think I've asked this question before, but maybe you've had a chance to refine some of the work on the new segment disclosures. Do you have a sense for differences in the margins in Investing and Lending versus, say, ICS?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">It's a little too early to tell. Well, some of that will be in the Q. Part of it has to do with how you allocate comp to the various segments, how you allocate some other expenses. It's a little too early. It's sometimes hard to do in the middle of the year, because that stuff only becomes clear at the end of the year. So even if you see some of that in the Q, it's really rough estimates. And it's really only what we have at the end of the year that is truly the meaningful margins.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">And historically, do you have a sense for as you look back over the last few years? And I know you didn't disclose more than a limited period but...</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">I think you would generally find that the Investing and Lending segment has at the higher end of the margins.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Got it. And then just a comp ratio question. You obviously chose to accrue it at 44. Last year, you used 43 for the first three quarters of the year. You've never actually stepped up to a higher accrual rate for the first three quarters from whatever you used in the prior year. Is there any message there that we should take away?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We never accrued as low as 43% in the year before last year either.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">That's fair.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">No. I wouldn't take any message. As you know, it's our best estimate of where we'll be. Now we don't know where we'll be. You know what we've historically done, so you can go look at that. But versus last year, as you know, we have more people in more places that are not necessarily generating as much revenue. And so the very, very slightly higher accrual seemed to make sense to us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Got it. Okay, thanks very much, David. Appreciate it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">You're welcome.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Your next question comes from the line of Roger Freeman with Barclays Capital.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So I just wanted to go back to, like, the capital discussion again. How do you sort of think about that roll forward? You've said you're sort of 8-ish percent which is, I guess, consistent with where you've talked about before. And as that sort of rolls forward, you've got your correlation book rolling off, some active mitigation in process. Gradually, you build a buffer here. As you then get sort of Basel III final rules and then Dodd-Frank, are you then able to go to the Fed and kind of lay out the case for confidence level of where you're going to be in the next couple of years and then get approval to do something more meaningful in terms of buyback?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">I think, Roger, it's too early for me to say that this is exactly how we're going to do it. We'll have to see what the final rules are. We'll have to see what the environment is like. In a tougher environment, we'll keep even more of a buffer. If it's a better environment, we might not. We'll have to look out as to what we think the opportunities are going to be. We're always going to run at higher more conservative capital levels. I think that's just the way we're going to manage the firm. We are in constant dialogue with our regulators. They know where we are and what we have. And we'll just decide over time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay. And then on the liquidity buffer, as you said, you're still near record level, I guess, with $171 billion this quarter. How much of that -- if you look at the treasury portion of that, what's the average duration there? I mean, should we be thinking about this as rates go up, that's actually going to be a positive in net interest income, or is it actually going to be a principal loss?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">I think it's going to be neither. It's really short. I mean, that stuff we can literally turn to cash instantly. So I mean, it is the equivalent of cash.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. Lastly, as you think about conforming to particularly Dodd-Frank and really Basel as well, do you ultimately anticipate any meaningful resizing of the FICC businesses in terms of deployment?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">As we sit here now, we don't think so. We think that business, as you know, is mostly a client-focused business, and we think it is the business that is allowed under Dodd-Frank. We think most of the businesses don't make sense under Basel. We've talked about some of the ones where the capital charges are pretty high. So no, we continue to be hopeful that that business is going to grow over time. And it's going to grow in more places. It's going to grow in the growth markets. We continue to be optimistic looking forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Are decisions like whether to allow cross margining of swaps and futures in clearing houses going to -- do you think have any meaningful impact on how active your clients are?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">It's just so hard to say right now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay, all right. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Harte with Sandler O'Neill.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Jeffrey Harte - Sandler O'Neill &amp; Partners L.P.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">The comments of leverage being low is kind of a conscious decision so you're well positioned to take advantage of opportunities when they present themselves. I guess I have two questions along that line. One is, what kind of areas are you specifically looking for opportunities to show themselves? And the second would be from a timing perspective, how patient do you plan to be? I mean, I have some flashbacks to waiting for distressed debt prices to get really low, and they never really did.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Well, I mean, it wasn't even so much that distressed debt prices didn't get so low, it's holders of distressed assets just didn't sell them. And so, I think, that was really the issue more than anything. Look, we're looking for -- first of all, we're looking for opportunities of just more client activity. So more client activity results in us using more capital. So that would be the first and best way for us to use our capital. Other than that, it would be opportunities if we saw, distressed assets of really any kind being available for sale. And we just -- we've seen some opportunities, not that many with our clients, and very, very minor opportunities in the distressed asset business, whether it be loans, real estate, other types of credit, very, very few opportunities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Jeffrey Harte - Sandler O'Neill &amp; Partners L.P.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. So is it much the economy is growing and that always cyclically leads to opportunities as opposed to your watching kind of specific areas?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">That is the biggest driver. Absolutely. Macroeconomic factors, client confidence, more certainty about regulatory reform. Those things tend to drive client activity, and that drives opportunities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Jeffrey Harte - Sandler O'Neill &amp; Partners L.P.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay, thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Deutsche Bank.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">David, the ROE picked up this quarter but still a ways from the long-term target. When you look at what can drive that higher, like how much does the weakness in, say, the higher ROE business like M&amp;A weigh on it? How much does the elevated cash level weigh on the ROE? And then just on the trading side and -- I would just say, in general, like customer activity -- like is there any gauge in terms of the level of balance sheet turnover that you would like historically see versus today that's also weighing on the returns in the trading area?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">You hit almost all of the things, all right? So elevated levels of cash, elevated levels of capital. We repaid Buffet, but those are all on the usage side. And then there's the return side itself, which -- the revenue side, which is really going to be driven by more activity. The higher ROE businesses. The merger business still -- if you look at the volumes compared to GDP, it's still at historic lows. Growth in assets and assets under management would be a high return business where you just haven't seen that much. You've seen a little bit flowing into higher fee businesses but not that much. And then just overall, more activity on the trading side. So you see more flow from our clients. All of those things would help drive ROE. As far as balance sheet turnover, the speed of turnover hasn't changed. It's still quite high, there just isn't as much of it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay, and then maybe just on the FICC side. When you look at that client activity level, do you feel that it's the macro environment that weighs on client interactions, or is it something more on the regulatory side? Meaning long-duration contracts, clients not wanting to get involved until you get more regulatory clarity around certain businesses like the OTC market?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Again, you are both asking and answering the questions at the same time. Because the answer is both of those things. I think there is definitely regulatory uncertainty is weighing on activity, people uncertain about how the rules are going to affect them. And the macroeconomic activity -- or the macroeconomic environment is also weighing on people. And I think that's why you've seen, over the last quarter now, but even going back to last year, stops and starts. Some good data comes out and people feel good, then there's no data, then there's regulatory uncertainty, then there's negative views of whether it's peripheral Europe or potential inflation in the growth markets or growth in the U.S. I mean, all of those things, you're seeing varying data. And that varying data causes fits and starts amongst clients. And so it's both. It's both of the things that you mentioned.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. And then final one, just on some of the capital ratios and regulation going forward. Some of the U.S., like, universal banks, have stated kind of a 7% to 9% Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III. You have some in Europe saying 10 all the way up to 19 on total capital. We haven't heard much out of Asia. But when you think about the nuances, whether its assets, risk weighted assets by country, leverage ratios by country and then the overall impact of financials relative to the economy, like, where do you think or -- do you think these ratios are going to be pretty standard across, or is there going to be a lot of differentiation? And then any clarity on the U.S. from like a timing standpoint in terms of getting clarity, whether it's on the capital ratios, liquidity levels, and then anything around Dodd-Frank on the OTC side?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I think it would be great if we had one set of capital rules around the world. But I think that each local regulator has their own views of the world. They look at things differently, and they have the right to regulate their local jurisdictions and I think we and other financial institutions around the world are -- we've always lived with that, and I think we're going to have to live with that. I think they're all trying hard to standardize the regulations as much as possible, but I think it's unrealistic to think that there is just going to be one set for everybody around the world. And as I said, we've lived through that, and we're going to have to live with that going forward. But they're doing the best job they can. As far as when we're going to get complete clarity in the U.S., I'm not sure. I know the regulators are working very hard at this and are trying again to do the best job they can. It's a very hard job. And so we're trying to be as helpful as we can. We're hopeful to get more clarity by the end of this year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay, thanks, guys.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question comes from the line of Meredith Whitney with Meredith Whitney Advisory Group.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Meredith Ann Whitney - Meredith Whitney Advisory Group LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">David, in going through your results today, I was reminded of a period that was equally unexciting, which was the early 2000s, no offense intended. But when there wasn't a lot of activity going on and you chose to take the time to do some impressively transformative things to your equity business. And I know you've done a lot in terms of rationalizing expense structures, offshoring, moving people to Utah, but can you talk about some of the transformative investments you're making today? And while you wait, what you're doing strategically on future planning and what businesses that affects?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. I think we've talked a little about this. First of all, hard to give you a definitive answer because how some of the regulations ultimately get written could drive how some of the businesses evolve. But we think it's pretty clear that some of the technological advances that happened in equities are going to happen in some of the FICC businesses. The technology and client connectivity are going to be very, very important. And without the 100% knowledge of exactly how that's going to work, which is one of the differences we have this time versus last time, we kind of knew where we were. We just had to get there. We're trying to get as prepared as we can for how we think things are ultimately going to shake out.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Meredith Ann Whitney - Meredith Whitney Advisory Group LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. It doesn't sound like it's in Goldman Sachs' nature to wait for client volumes to come back, although obviously you are a product of client volumes. But you should have a pretty good sense. This feels structurally long lived. So I'm not asking you to give an outlook, but what happens over the next few quarters if we still have volumes like this?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Look, as you know, I'm bad at predicting. I don't like to do that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Meredith Ann Whitney - Meredith Whitney Advisory Group LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I always ask, though.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I don't know what volumes are going to be. But one thing you know about the markets is they tend to get better and worse faster than people think they're going to. And I'm not at all predicting volume is going to pick. They could easily slow down a lot, given some of the macroeconomic uncertainty that is out there. And if volumes continued to stay where they are or get slower, and we think they're going to stay that way, then we would have to make some changes whether it would be the capital, the headcount or it's other expense items.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Meredith Ann Whitney - Meredith Whitney Advisory Group LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. Just last sort of wrap up. On a non-comp changes that you've made, in terms of expense reductions, are you over 85% there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">We've been -- we, through the downturn, have been very, very careful about our non-comp expenses. So I'd say, we are -- there is not a lot to do in non-comp expenses that we haven't done. There's always more you can do. But there's not that much to do.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Meredith Ann Whitney - Meredith Whitney Advisory Group LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay, all right. Thanks, David.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Can you elaborate more on the backlog? On the one hand, as you mentioned, there's the macroeconomic uncertainty, regulatory uncertainty, at least a couple of your competitors said things were a little bit softer going to the second quarter, and you just had the CEO of U.S. Bancorp saying the second half of the first-quarter was weaker. So you have all those negative factors. Then you say, \"Well, backlogs are up.\" Can you quantify how much the backlogs are up versus the fourth quarter and where that's coming from?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Mike, I don't give out the actual numbers. And again, you've got to be very careful with backlog numbers. The increase in backlog is more focused. It's up across the board in both Advisory as well as Underwriting, but it's more heavily weighted toward Underwriting, both debt and equities than it is towards Advisory. And I think you see deals announced on the Underwriting side, both debt and equity. You see that volume's actually been pretty high there, whereas M&amp;A volumes have been much lower. And as we've seen before, a lot of activity, a lot of dialogue level around the M&amp;A business. But unless some of the macro uncertainty goes away, I don't think that's going to pick up. And if the macro uncertainty does go away, I think that could pick up a lot.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And by geography?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Again, I don't have the backlog by geography at my fingertips. So that's something we'll have to get back to you on.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And when we look at the fourth quarter to the first quarter, the geographic growth in revenues, I mean, was it stronger in the U.S. and Europe than emerging markets? Or how did that breakdown?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Fourth quarter to first quarter, not really a big difference. Very, very similar. As I said, mid- to high-50s in the U.S., 60%, 40%, Europe, Asia, outside the U.S. Round numbers, plus or minus a percent or two.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And switching gears, syndicated lending has really ramped up year-over-year. And how aggressively are you getting involved there? Do you see any warning signals? What were your fees from syndicated lending deals? And any other commentary?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Look, we're a participant in that market, but we're not as big a participant to some of our competitors or bigger. Credit terms have tightened. They are more borrower-friendly than they were a year ago. But there are some terms that you might think are too tight. I think one, banks are including us, are being much more careful about the terms, about the amount of leverage in deals. It's still a lot lower than we saw at some of the heights in the market. And the time to market commitment is much, much shorter than it was, which is one of the biggest mitigants for taking risk.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And then lastly, any comments on the watch on the government debt? S&amp;P's move yesterday? How would that impact how you do business?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">It will not impact how we do business at all. And I have no comment on it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">All right, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">You're welcome.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question comes from the line of Ed Najarian with ISI Group.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Ed Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">David, I guess just a question related to the incentive-based stock-based comp, the $1.5 billion that you spent to buy back stock this year to keep shares flat. Could you give us an outlook for approximately what that would be for the remaining three quarters of the year? Is it seasonally higher in the first quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Ed, again, I apologize. I'm going to have to -- we're going to have to -- I don't have those numbers at my fingertips.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Ed Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay, when you give that 11% outlook by the end of 2012 for Basel III-based Tier 1 common, does that include what you would spend to keep the shares flat related to stock-based employee comp?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Well, actually, in doing that, we assumed no increase in equity for equity-based comp and no buy backs. So if you assume that they offset each other, then it's the same number. So we just assumed neither in those numbers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Ed Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So you assumed you would not be buying back the stock?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Well, it's as if we assumed we would buy back whatever the equity-based comp is. We assumed no increase in equity for equity-based comp and no buy backs. So another way of thinking about it is, we assumed exactly offsetting each other</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Ed Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Oh, I see. Okay. And then just quick follow-up question. 300-person headcount reduction related to the end of 2010, should we be reading anything into that? Are you going to sort of try to continue to rationalize the headcount a little bit?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">No, you should read nothing into it. It's just the first quarter is the slow hiring period. And as you know, natural but very low attrition. Most of our hiring is done through the summer. So no, you should read absolutely nothing into that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Ed Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">You're welcome.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Christoph M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes, I mean, obviously, there's only so much you can say about capital. But I just wanted to come at it a different way, which is -- I mean, is there a way for us to think about how much capital one needs to run a world-class investment bank? I mean, you're sitting there on $64 billion of tangible common. You have Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan around $40 billion. BofA allocates $31 billion. The Europeans, Cr\u00e9dit Suisse, Barclays, UBS, and Deutsche are all somewhere in the $30-ish billion. And shouldn't we all be thinking that at some point, that that spread between the capital you have allocated and everybody else's, it gets to a silly point?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I'm not quite sure how to answer that. I told you, we've been pretty conservative. We have more capital than we need for the business right this second. But there's a lot of uncertainty out there. We can only speak for ourselves. We can't speak for others. There's a lot of uncertainty. We are hoping that we see opportunities. And well, if we don't, then we'll have to give more back. We've said that. But I can't speak for others. You should ask them that question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Christoph M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. And then secondly, can you talk, maybe if not on this call at some other point, in more detail about the Asset Management business? Because I think we're sitting here -- essentially, the AUM is unchanged from where it was three years ago, and we're wondering how do you plan to get that business back into a growth mode? And what's the strategy and plan for doing that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Sure, I'll give you the quick version now and happy to talk as much as you want. Obviously, over the last three years, we had a big decline and then a big increase in there. So 2008 was pretty difficult to the Asset Management business, as well as other businesses. And then it picked up after that, it's been roughly flat over the last year. All of the mix has gotten better. So you've had more of -- fewer money market assets, more alternatives to fixed income assets, still higher fee paying. That's one of our biggest focuses. We are very focused on our distribution and making sure we hire the right number of people so that we can distribute our product. And then we can continue to focus on the performance, because we know, ultimately, that's going to drive things.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Christoph M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">All right, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">You're welcome.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question comes from the line of Kian Abouhossein with JPMorgan.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I had a question regarding your FICC and equity revenues. Can you give me an idea how it would look like on a historic reporting basis, first of all?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I don't have that because we stopped calculating it. When we went to the new basis, we're no longer calculating how it would have looked on the old basis. So I really don't know.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. And last time, on the last call, you mentioned that it was just after the FSOC document came out and you were studying it at that point. I was wondering what is your thinking now about market making?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Look. Again, there's nothing in that document that's different than where we thought before. But the rules are not written yet. We have to see what the final rules say. Our understanding is if the regulators are trying to write rules that are sensible, that makes sense for the safety and soundness of the financial system but also don't hurt the growth of free flow of capital in our Capital Markets. So we just have to wait and see what the final rules are.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay, and in respect to the Investing &amp; Lending business, clearly very difficult to forecast. Also looking at your filing, there's limited information to really come to a good forecasting off of that part of the business. Can you run us through kind of steps how you as an outsider would look at this business so we get a better understanding besides ICBC, how we should forecast the other lines?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Well, as you know, and I don't need to tell you, it's hard for forecast any of our businesses. They are not recurring constant revenues. So it is hard to forecast. We give you the asset balances. We give you our potential for 10% declines. Now obviously, idiosyncratic things could affect our portfolios versus others. But I think the best you can do is look at the asset balances, look at the potential 10% declines and make best estimates there. Obviously, this quarter, we did better than that would have implied. There will be some quarters we'll do somewhat worse. But it is difficult to forecast our businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Is there any kind of -- can we think about recurring revenues that are in there that we could assume? I think you mentioned there's some recurring revenues in these lines.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">There's some amount of interest in the debt line. I tell you, this quarter, it was round numbers, 20% to 25% of that line. So that's going to be recurring, but that's a small part of it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And lastly, you gave a very good presentation February 9, and you had this good page to [ph] inventory slide, but they excluded OTC derivatives. And I was wondering if you would include OTC derivatives, how would the slide change?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I'm not sure how you measure OTC derivatives as far as inventory turnover goes. Because first of all, there's often restructurings of derivatives. And so, do you count it if it's restructured, is it a new transaction or old transaction. And they're really all over the map. You also have derivatives where you might hedge the derivative. And you might have a long-dated derivative and a short-dated hedge that you constantly roll. So it's very, very hard to measure OTC derivatives, which is why we excluded it. No reason other than the measurement difficulty.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">All right, thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">You're welcome.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">[Operator Instructions]  Your next question is from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">David, just a quick administrative question. Any effect from CVA DVA in the quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Oh, yes. It was about a $40 million gain, and it's virtually all in FICC client execution. So very small.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay, so not very much at all.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">No.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Just curious about a couple of trends that we noticed in the Securities Services revenues lines quarter-over-quarter. Looks like it was a little flat. And that seems to be in contrast with somewhat greater activity levels that you mentioned in equity and fixed income. Could you provide a little more color on what's going on in the Securities Services business? Are your clients there taking less risk than clients you see in the more FICC and Equity side of the business?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So, what I would tell you there, you're right. It was almost exactly flat. And interestingly, it was pretty flat balances and pretty flat spreads quarter-over-quarter. It wasn't much of a change in anything. And there's just -- while activity was up versus the fourth quarter, it's still not that high. And leverage within the hedge fund community is still not very high. And so that hasn't changed all that much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay, that's helpful. And then one final question in terms of the net or the flat net flows in the Asset Management business throughout alternative investments equity and fixed-income, that seems to be a little bit in contrast with what we saw with a couple of your competitors. Just curious if you can give a little more color as to what's going on there, outside of the liquidity products, which are obviously down across the street?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Right. So what I would say -- look, different firms are different. If you look across, you'll see some up, some down. One thing I would say is that one place where we do not have a big presence is in passive products. And passive products, clearly, were up more than others. And other people who are concentrated there would have had better flows than we would have.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay, that's helpful, David. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">You're welcome.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question is a follow-up from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Bank of America Merrill Lynch</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">David, just quickly, given that commodities markets especially obviously oil were very active and trending in the quarter, I was a little surprised not to hear you call out commodities in any way as you talked about FICC. And I was wondering if you could characterize activity levels there a little bit?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Activity levels in commodities were pretty good. I mentioned that it was very balanced, that we had a solid quarter in commodities, as well as the other products. So it was a good quarter in commodities. It was a good quarter in all of the businesses. So I didn't mean to not mention them, because it was a good quarter in commodities. But it was -- as I said, solid quarter in commodities but all the other businesses as well</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Got it. Thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">You're welcome.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">At this time, there are no further questions. I will now turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Dane Holmes</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">We'd like to thank everyone for joining us for our first quarter earnings call.

My name is Dennis, and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to The Goldman Sachs Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Also, this call is being recorded today, Tuesday, July 19, 2011. Thank you. Mr. Holmes, you may begin your conference.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Dane Holmes</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Director of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm's belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain and outside of the firm's control. The firm's actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in these -- in those forward-looking statements. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our current annual report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended December 2010. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets and global core excess. And you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that is posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website, www.gs.com. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">This audiocast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Our Chief Financial Officer, David Viniar, will now review the firm's results. David?</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thanks, Dane. I'd like to thank all of you for listening today. I'll give an overview of our second quarter results and then take your questions. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Net revenues in the second quarter were $7.3 billion, and net earnings were $1.1 billion. Earnings per diluted share were $1.85, and our annualized return on common equity was 6.1%. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Year-to-date, excluding the impact of a $1.6 billion preferred dividend associated with our repayment of the Berkshire Hathaway preferred stock in the first quarter, our annualized return on common equity was 10.2%. Including the impact, our annualized return on common equity was 8%. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">The second quarter was dominated by concerns surrounding the state of the global economy. These concerns emanated from a variety of regions around the world including Europe, the United States and China. While many of these concerns have been around for quite some time, the further deterioration in economic data coupled with the passage of time without resolution of the significant number of political issues has led to heightened concerns among market participants. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Sovereign risk in a number of smaller European member states increased with a particular focus on development increase. Concerns remain for other countries within Europe and the potential negative economic impact on financial institutions with credit exposure to these sovereigns. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Within the U.S., concerns have centered on the political debate on the raising the debt ceiling, a growing budget deficit, stubbornly high unemployment and potential further pressure on U.S. housing prices. Finally, there has also been greater focus on China given the important role it plays in the broader global economy. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">The complexities surrounding the interplay of these various economic considerations has created tremendous uncertainty about the state of the world's economy and, among other things, has resulted in limited conviction among market participants. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">As a result of this uncertainty, many of our investing clients have significantly reduced their risk appetite, and thus, activity levels generally declined. Despite these market uncertainties, we remain focused on serving the needs of our leading global client base. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Within Investment Banking, we continue to focus on providing our clients with world-class strategic advice and superior financing execution, which is reflected in our Investment Banking league table standards.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Year-to-date, we ranked first in announced M&amp;A globally. We're also ranked first in equity and equity-related common stock offerings and IPOs global year-to-date. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We understand that our clients value consistent high-quality service and excellent execution, effectively meeting their needs for advice, financing, risk capital and liquidity, as well as asset management solutions essential to our long-term performance. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In the context of more difficult economic and financial conditions, the firm launched an internal initiative to identify areas where we can operate more efficiently. Thus far, we've targeted approximately $1.2 billion in run rate compensation and non-compensation reductions. We're in the process of implementing the cost reduction efforts and expect to complete them before year end. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">I'll now review each of our businesses. Investment Banking produced second quarter net revenues of $1.4 billion, up 14% from first quarter results. Second quarter advisory revenues were $637 million, up 78% from the first quarter, reflecting a number of significant deal closings. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the quarter, including Johnson &amp; Johnson's $21.3 billion acquisition of Synthes, Skype's $8.5 billion sale to Microsoft and Diversity's $4.3 billion sale to Sealed Air Corporation. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We're also the adviser on a number of significant closed transactions, including Pride International's $8.7 billion merger with ESCO, Beckman-Coulter's $6.8 billion sales to Danaher and Equinox Minerals' $7.7 billion sales to Barrick Gold. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Second quarter underwriting net revenues were $811 million, down 11% sequentially. Equity underwriting revenues of $378 million were down 11% from the first quarter, reflecting more challenging equity markets. Debt underwriting revenues decreased 11% to $433 million, reflecting lower investing grade and CMBS issuance volume, partially offset by strong leveraged finance activity. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">During the second quarter, we participated in many noteworthy underwriting transactions, including PRADA's $2.5 billion IPO, Shanghai Pharmaceuticals' $2.1 billion IPO, and Wal-Mart's $5 billion long-term debt offering. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Our Investment Banking backlog was unchanged compared with the end of the first quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Turning to Institutional Client Services, which is comprised of FICC and equities client execution, commissions and fees and security services, net revenues of $3.5 billion, were down 47% from the first quarter as continued macro concerns created more challenging market and operating conditions. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">The effect of these macro concerns was more pronounced within our Asian and European FICC franchises, which have historically been significant contributors to the global franchise. Further, during the quarter, we were not as effective at navigating inter-quarter swing to the market prices and liquidity that we have been historically. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Consequently, we generated lower revenues from managing client-originated market-making inventory, particularly in our largely U.S.-based mortgages business and our global commodities and credit businesses. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In this environment, we were particularly prudent in the management of our market risk. This is highlighted by the fact that VaR in the second quarter was in its lowest quarterly level since the third quarter of 2006. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">FICC Client Execution net revenues were $1.6 billion in the second quarter, down significantly from the first quarter, as every major business generated lower but positive revenues. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Our commodities business was negatively impacted by asset price fluctuations. Credit experienced the more challenging environment for hedging and inventory management. Our mortgages results reflected the negative impact of asset price decline, reduced market liquidity, and greater divergence between our cash positions and corresponding hedges, particularly in non-agency products. Interest rates and FX were also down but to a lesser extent. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In equities, which includes the equities client execution, commissions and fees and securities services, net revenues for the second quarter were $1.9 billion, down 17% sequentially. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Equities client execution revenues were down 36% to $623 million, reflecting lower net revenues within our cash and derivatives businesses as declining volumes and lower volatility impacted results. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Commissions and Fees were $861 million, down 11% from the first quarter on lower market volumes. Securities services net revenues of $432 million were 16% higher sequentially due to the seasonally stronger client activity. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to risk. Average daily value of risk in the second quarter was $101 million, down 11% relative to the first quarter. Our value of risk remains at levels we have not experienced in a number of years. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Now I'll review Investing &amp; Lending, which produced net revenue of $1 billion in the second quarter. The firm's Investing &amp; Lending activities across various asset classes, primarily including debt securities and loan and equity securities, are included in this segment. These activities include both direct investing and investing through funds, as well as lending activities. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Our investment in ICBC produced a $176 million loss in the quarter. Other equity investments generated net revenues of $686 million across our portfolio of funded and direct investments. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $200 million, principally from interest income. Other revenues of $334 million were primarily driven by operating revenues from our consolidated investment entities. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In Investment Management, we reported second quarter net revenues of $1.3 billion, consistent with first quarter results. Management and other fees were 3% higher sequentially at $1.1 billion. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">During the second quarter, assets under management increased $4 billion to $844 billion due to market appreciation in fixed income assets. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to expenses, compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards, and other items such as payroll taxes and benefits, has accrued at a compensation-to-net-revenue ratio of 44% for the second quarter of 2011, a ratio consistent with the compensation accrual in the first quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Second quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.5 billion, 6% lower than the first quarter, which included impairment charges of approximately $220 million related to assets classified as held for sale, primarily related to Litton Loan Servicing. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Adjusting for the $220 million impairment charge and provisions for litigation, non-compensation expenses in the second quarter of 2011 were essentially unchanged. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Total staff at the end of the second quarter is approximately 35,500, relatively unchanged from the end of the first quarter. Our effective tax rate was 32.6% for the second quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As a management team, while we were disappointed in the performance of certain businesses this quarter, we're committed to creating long-term shareholder value. We believe that the core drivers of long-term value continue to be the strength of our global client franchise and our employees' tireless commitment to serving that franchise. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">While the current environment presents a number of challenges, we continue to invest in expanding our global platform. Our effort to drive greater efficiencies within our operations are an important component supporting this growth plan. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We remain focused on generating superior returns for our shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased 10.8 million shares of common stock for a total cost of $1.5 billion. Furthermore, our Board of Directors has authorized a 75 million share increase in our share repurchase program, bringing our total authorization to approximately 91 million shares. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In this ongoing challenging environment, we'll continue to balance near-term uncertainties with longer-term strategic goals. We will balance holding more capital and liquidity to protect against the current macro uncertainties with our commitment to providing strong relative return to our shareholders. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We'll invest for growth in attractive regions and businesses and reduce our commitment to businesses experiencing lower client demand. This adaptability is at the heart of our culture. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">While the outlook remains uncertain, we'll continue to respond accordingly with the goal of positioning the firm to best serve our clients and shareholders. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">With that, I'd like to thank you again for listening today, and I'm now happy to take your questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p4\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line Glenn Schorr with Nomura.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">So if we could talk FICC for a little bit, I think that's where some of the focus is going to obviously come. And if you can give us a little more color towards kind of breaking down what is just bad positioning, bad trading quarter, weak environment, versus is there something bigger going on that's impacting the Goldman franchise? Because you talked about lower VaR, so it sounds like you purposely took down risk. But can we just talk through FICC a little?</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Okay, I'll try. So I said a lot of this in what I started with, but let me just give you a little bit -- a little more, Glenn. We don't believe there was really any impairment of our franchise at all during the quarter, but I don't want to sugarcoat things. I think we underperformed during the quarter. So just a little more on that. Every business, as I imagine, had positive revenues. So it's not like there were big losses somewhere. Volumes were lower, but they weren't a lot lower, which is why I tell that we don't think there was any impairment of our franchise. We have certain -- I mean, it's harder to figure out volumes in some of the FICC businesses than it is in Investment Banking, where you have league tables and you have volume numbers. But we have several measures that we use, and I would tell you that they were down but down modestly. Given some of the macro uncertainties that we saw, many of which were driven by political rather than economic issues -- so they're much harder to analyze, certainly for us -- we didn't manage the market-making inventory that we get as well as we have in the past. That was true across the franchise. It was especially true in Europe and Asia, where many of these macro political concerns existed. As a result, we retained very, very little risk. You saw what our VaR numbers were on average across the quarter, and I will tell you at the end of the quarter, they were even lower than they were throughout the quarter. In hindsight, given the way things unfolded, that may have been a bad decision; it may not have been a bad decision. We don't know, and we may not know for a while, but the position that we made. And again, given that, we -- without sugarcoating, we did underperform during the quarter. Now one of the very, very few quarters since our IPO that we've underperformed, in fact, but we did. We're disappointed in the results. We're glad that it's really nothing to do with our franchise, and we're very focused on doing better in the future.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">All right. I'll take my head in my hands on this one and ask, with risk levels, macro -- still uncertainties still out there and risk still low at the end of the quarter, are we expected that this is a current environment run rate? Or do we get a little bit of reprieve as we move forward from a tough second quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">I don't think there's such a thing as a run rate in FICC. I don't think there's anything normal. Look, we're 11 days into this quarter, so it's very hard to make assumptions on what's going to happen going forward. And let me give you all the caveats. It's, a, it's 11 days. B, it's the third quarter, which includes August every year, you can't avoid it, it will this year. C, there are other things besides our trading business. And we have, obviously, a position ICBC, other principal investments. You've seen what's going on in the equity market. That's not so good, although that comes and goes. But as far as trading goes, while our risk remains quite low right now, it feels a little better so far in the second quarter. Let me again caveat, that it's only 11 days into the quarter, but so far, it feels a little better.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">The $1.2 billion that you identified earlier in the call, non-comp and comp, can you give us any thought on how much it's weighted towards non-comp and comp? Because I feel like -- and what is outside the normal managing the ratio to the revenue environment? In other words, it seems like you're identifying that $1.2 billion as an above-and-beyond reaction to the environment, regulation, things like that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So a couple of things. First, just to be clear, that's $1.2 billion of run rate. You're not going to see a $1.2 billion reduction in this year's expenses. A lot of that we'll do this year, but you won't see the expenses until next year. Second of all, that does not include -- when I say comp and non-comp, that does not include lowering people's compensation. So that comp would be a reduction of hedge, which would therefore be a compensation -- a reduction in compensation. And look, we think that given, a, some of the regulatory uncertainties, but b, some of the economic uncertainties, it looks like the environment's going to be somewhat slower for the foreseeable future. And so we decided that it made sense at this point to cut some level of expenses to be more efficient.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">And last one is on Volcker timing, do you expect the draft like in the near future? I'm not sure you can comment on your back and forth, but just thoughts on timing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We don't know any more than you know about when things are going to come out. We think that there will be drafts some time this year, but exactly when, we're not sure.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Your next question comes from the line of Howard Chen with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Just revisiting the cost savings, could you just give a sense for how you arrived at that $1.2 billion target? Does that get you to a specific level of expenses or returns across the franchise that you want to -- or that you're comfortable with?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">I would tell you, a, it's more of an art than a science. It was done business-by-business. We looked at what we thought the opportunity set was going to be going forward, where both business-by-business, region-by-region. So it's not -- while it is somewhat, excuse me, across the board, it's not exactly the same everywhere. And we tried to say what do we think the opportunity's going to be, and how many people do we need, and what do we need to cut back in expenses to have appropriate returns for our shareholders.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay. And then on this quarter's Investing &amp; Lending results, fairly positive in a more challenging environment for asset prices. So could you give us a flavor for maybe realization versus writeups this quarter, David?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Yes. In -- I think that's one of the things that really drove the equity number. There were a fair number of realizations within there. The market were down. So obviously, the mark-to-market on public securities was actually a negative in the quarter. But on the private securities, we're up a fair amount, and of what was up, probably 60% was realized.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Great. And then finally for me, your share repurchase activity accelerated to $1.5 billion this quarter. Is that more a function of the stock price or the approval of the Feds capital plan last quarter? I'm just trying to gauge, looking forward -- clearly, a strong confidence-sending message with respect to the reload, but how aggressive you all want to be in terms of the share repurchase?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Look, we want to do 2 things. A, as you know, we want to keep our share count at least flat, no more -- no higher than flat from our equity-based compensation. And we do try and adjust it a little bit based on where we think the share price is. And we have very, very strong capital ratios. We continue to generate capital through earnings, as well as through compensation. And so we want to be prudent. We're probably going to keep high-end capital ratios for a while, higher than most others, because we think it makes sense in this market. But we're going to be -- also be prudent in returning capital to shareholders as we think it's okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay. Just a clarification on that maybe, David. When you say high end, I know you've given your Basel III guidance without a lot of -- very conservatively at near 8% last quarter. Is that -- I mean, when you say high end, do you mean kind of near 8% Basel III? Or are you thinking about a Basel I figure, or neither?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Yes, yes and yes. Right now, we're under Basel I, and so we're going to -- we have to, obviously, pay attention to that. And we will continue to keep, as I said, high-end capital ratios, without being more specific. But we're also looking out towards Basel III, because we know that's coming. We're -- as we've told you, we're -- we'd be at around 8% if we were looking at it today. If you look out just a couple of years before many of the requirements kick in and you make some assumptions on consensus earnings and just passive mitigation with things just rolling off without us doing anything, you get to like 11%, close to 11% numbers. And so those are pretty high end. I wouldn't expect we'll run things much higher than that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So you talked a fair amount about the volatility in results in FICC, particularly, I guess, in commodities and mortgage. It does seem to be -- and your European credit. It does seem to be more than usual. I mean, you've always had excellent risk management, but I just wondered if after this bout of revenue volatility, you're looking at making any specific changes in the risk management regime?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">No. I wouldn't say so. I don't actually think it was a risk management issue. It's, as I said, it's not like we had losses. Maybe we made a bad decision in taking too little risk. I don't know. I'm not sure we would do anything differently with hindsight. And one of the difficult things for us, if you look across the volatility in the markets, a lot of it was driven by political rather than economic issues. That's an environment that's very hard to analyze, very difficult for us. And so in that type of environment, we took risk down a fair amount. And therefore, again, not to pull punches, we underperformed.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Got it. Okay. So yes, I hear you. The -- would you be able to update us a little bit on your exposure to the 5 European countries that everybody's worried about, maybe a gross and a net number, and talk about how you hedged down to the net?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">I can give you now kind of general as opposed to all the specifics you asked for. On a net basis, Guy, our exposure is actually pretty modest. We have, I would say, total for the 5 that I think you're referring to, between $1.5 billion and $2 billion of exposure. It's really pretty modest.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And in terms of how you get down from whatever the gross number is to the net, obviously, the question that people have in the wake of what happened with the mortgage problem here in the U.S., is that sometimes your hedges -- not yours in particular, but hedges don't work as well as people would have wanted, and you get wrong way risk, counterparties that get into trouble, et cetera. How do you get comfort with where you are on the sovereign stuff?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">How about if we follow up with you on that offline a little bit, we'll give you some more detail. But I wouldn't -- don't take that to mean anything. Our gross exposure is not all that big either. We're -- we've been pretty cautious in that region for a while, but the net is really modest.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. Fair enough. And then just in terms of headcount numbers, as you pointed out, you're flat versus last quarter. You do have some cost reduction targets. But can you give a sense as to what we should expect in terms of the kind of evolution of your headcount over the remainder of the year and into next year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">As we sit here now, and of course, as you know, things can change, the headcount reductions that would be associated with that $1.2 billion I talked about would be in the range of 1,000 people globally. And that would come over the course of this year and then we'll see next year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. But presumably, we could then actually see a little bit of a boost, though, in the third quarter because of normal recruiting and stuff?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">No. I took that into account in the number I gave you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Got it. Okay. Just a final question, and I think last quarter, you helped us understand what the ROE impact was of maintaining the kind of global core excess that you have. Can you give us a sense for what the liquidity drag is at this point?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">I actually don't know that number offhand, Guy. I didn't calculate it. We'll get it to you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Your next question comes from the line Roger Freeman with Barclays Capital.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So just to come back to the capital piece here. In terms of net buybacks -- and I think you partially answered this. But given that you've got leading capital ratios among your peers and some of them seem to have authorizations to do more meaningful net buybacks, I mean my question is, is it fair to say that you just haven't asked to do that as opposed to not having been given authorization to do it? And also, as you roll out to that 11 -- call it 11 percentage number under Basel III, I mean, if your minimum is 9%, would you expect to run at a couple of hundred basis points premium to that? Because I thought something more like a 100 is probably where you'd end up.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Let me answer the second question first, which is no. We would not expect to run at a 200-basis-point excess over whatever our minimum is. That would be higher. We would expect to run lower than that. I think you're right. Somewhere in the 100-ish basis point range, depending on what the minimum is, might be where we would be. On the first one, but we, without giving too much detail on our conversation with the Fed, we're very comfortable that we have the authorizations we would like to have for the remainder of this year. As you know, that is authorized cap plans for this year, next year is next year. We think we can buy back what makes sense for us to buy back over the rest of the course of this year. We will calibrate that based on performance, share price, the environment and a bunch of other things. But I think we'll be reasonable in our buybacks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. But so then this gets to sort of the other part of the question, which is how do you think about running at capital levels, rolling forward to Basel III, relevant to the implementation days? Because JPMorgan just said that they'll get -- they'll do that when it's required years from now. It sounds like you're basically there, probably your minimum today, or close to it. And would you run at or above the eventual required level as opposed to, say, buying stock back at one times book today?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Look, we'll -- we will certainly buy some stock back at one times book today. That's going to make sense for us to do in this environment. We will probably want -- we think the market is going to look at capital requirements. And when the capital requirements are known, they're going to expect people to be there pretty quickly. We'll probably get there pretty quickly, but that doesn't mean we're going to have to run above it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. And then 2 more quick questions. On the hedging that you talked about in terms of some of the underperformance in FICC. On the mortgage piece, I thought that the derivatives underperformed, went down more than cash kind of during that falloff. I would have thought there would have been a better hedge outcome for you if you were short of that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I think what you saw, really, across all credit products, was that cash declined more than the revenues.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. Okay. And then the last question. In terms of your expense review, does that have any impact on how you're thinking about growing out the -- your emerging market business? That's where a lot of hiring has been.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">No.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. That continues...</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">No. That is a long-term investment, and we know it, and we continue to be very committed to that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question comes from the line Michael Carrier with Deutsche Bank.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Just on the -- you announced the expense initiatives. But with the challenging environment kind of going on over a year: you got fairly challenging capital market conditions, the macro issues. You mentioned whether it's Europe, U.S., economic growth pretty weak. And then the regulatory changes pressuring certain businesses, even some that may otherwise not fall under some of the increased regulation. I guess, are there any businesses -- or how long do you wait till instead of just expense initiatives, you look at any of the businesses that may be better off either being spun off, restructured to compete with some of the peer play, whether it's asset managers, alternative managers, private equity firms? Just any sense on that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">We've talked before. There are 2 businesses we had that we knew we were not going to be able to operate in the -- under the Volcker rules. Those being 2 prop businesses, GSPS and Global Macro Prop. We've shut those down. There's no other business that we think we have that we won't be able to operate. Some will have to be smaller. Some will have to be different. In our merchant banking business, we know that we won't be able to have more than 3% equity in any of the private equity funds. We still think that's going to be a really good business for Goldman Sachs. We think it's going to be important for our clients to be able to vest along side of us. We think our franchise will still be able to find really good opportunities, and we think earning fees and overrides on that will be good for the firm. And so that's probably the next business that will be most effective. So, no, we don't think it will be better in someone else's hands. We're still pretty optimistic about that. Now subject to whatever the final rules are, we will continue to evaluate things as the rules come out. And if we think differently then we'll take action. But right now, we don't think that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. And then as you've had more time to analyze each business, can you give any update on risk-weighted asset, mitigation, opportunities there? And then as well as any areas where you have seen or could possibly have seen repricing in the industry to aid returns?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Look, I think that we continue to go through the risk mitigation. We still are several years away from any of those things having to happen. And so we're not really going to take actions now, because it wouldn't make any sense. But we'll continue to analyze those and take actions that are appropriate and, more importantly, not do things that are long dated that will have very high risk-weighted asset charges above and beyond what the returns could warrant. I think the only places that you're really seeing repricing of things is in tranche credit. Anything that's structured credit, which is the things that are most severely hit by the capital rules, you're seeing some adjustment present.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. And then last one just on the Investment &amp; Lending business. You guys provide that sensitivity in the queue, but do you have any color in terms of the portfolio, percent that is public versus private, just in terms of trying to get a sense in the future? I mean, obviously, it's a challenge, but just the portion that's going to be more based on either DCF models and kind of long-term views versus just the public markets?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I do not have that with me now. Sorry.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question comes from the line Kian Abouhossein with JPMorgan.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">A few questions. First of all, the staff number reduction, the net 1,000, can you give us an idea in what business segment we should think about potential staff reduction, as well as at what level? Is it more at the junior level or more at the senior level?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I'm actually glad you asked that question, Kian, because I should have mentioned it before. The reason I mentioned the dollars first is because we're much more focused on the dollars that the savings we'll create than the number of heads. And so businesses are actually looking to get to a dollar number. That's why I gave you a number like in the range of 1,000 heads, because it could be somewhat more, it could be somewhat less. And we're still working through exactly what it's going to be from a seniority level, but it's really more dollar focused than head focused. And so it's going to be -- the long way of saying it, it's going to be some more senior, some more junior people. As far as businesses, as I said, I'm not going to be very specific on which businesses. It's not going to be a lot in the growth market, because that continues to be a big strategic plus for Goldman Sachs. And it is broad based, but some businesses more than others.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And switching to revenues, if I look at some of the competitors who have reported FICC revenues, you look at a decline of about 20%, 27%. Now in terms of run rate, would you argue that is a reasonable number if you take out your trading-related issues?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I do not believe there is such a thing as a run rate in FICC. I think it is -- and we've -- you've heard me say this before, I think it's a very dangerous thing when we had our highest quarter ever in the first quarter of 2009, and people said, \"Is this the new run rate?\" I said, \"No. It is not a run rate.\" When we had our lowest quarter before this quarter, in the fourth quarter of last year and now this quarter, I would tell you, no, this is not a run rate. I think it is very sensitive to what the economic environment is, what the activity levels are and what our clients are doing. And so I think to think that there is a run rate is a very dangerous thing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">But if I take your second quarter numbers and I'm trying to find out what is kind of a clean revenue number, and I look at some of your peers, which are down more around the 25% level relative to the first quarter, and I assume that against your first quarter, wouldn't that be a good reasonable thing to do considering that's reflective of the fixed income market, to get an indication of what's kind of clean for you?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I think you -- if you're saying, is that an indication of what a definition of our underperformance in the first quarter, I mean, you can do that analysis and the numbers are right. To say that that's a good way to model going forward, I just think, you don't know.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. And if I look at your return on equity, 8% in the first half, and it's fair to say that, normally, the second half revenues are always more difficult than the first half, then how should we think about your ROE generation? And can you give us an indication of how we think about the ROE this year, in particular, considering also the second quarter trading issue?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So first, just not to pick over this, but in the first half, you're correct. It was 8%. But obviously, the repayment of the Berkshire Hathaway preferred was a really unusual thing. Without that, it would have been 10%. I think our normal desire is to get to 20%. I think it's going to be very tough in this environment, very tough in this year. I'd be surprised if we did that this year. It's very hard for me to target ROEs. Tell me what the economic environment's going to be, and I can do a better job of telling you what it's going to be. But we just don't know what the economic environment is going to be the second half of this year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Oh, you -- just the comp? You go significantly low on the comp ratio?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Again, have a lower comp ratio with lower revenues, it tends to go the other way. But as you know and you've seen the last several years, we're very prudent with our compensation. We take the firm's performance into account. And if performance is lower, compensation's going to be lower.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question comes from the line Meredith Whitney with Meredith Whitney Advisory Group.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Meredith Ann Whitney - Meredith Whitney Advisory Group LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I am going to beat a dead horse a bit on the expenses and ask why the target of $1.2 billion is so low. Is that the first swipe? Because that doesn't really move the needle so much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Well, we hope it's not the first swipe, because it's painful to do, and we don't want to do this more than once. It's based on our assessments of the opportunities set looking forward and how we need to size the firm to take advantage of those. And as I say, it's not a science but more of an art.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Meredith Ann Whitney - Meredith Whitney Advisory Group LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. A lot of discussion have gone on this quarter about how total comp is less variable in the industry than it's ever been, and a lot of that was driven by the salary adjustments post to U.K. bonus tax when salaries were re-rated up. Do you think it's possible for the industry then to re-rate those salaries back down? And then on the non-comp side, how much of your non-comp is tied to headcount?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. So I think we shouldn't overplay that first part. I think it is true that salaries have gone up. I know they have at Goldman Sachs, probably in other places too. In the context of the percentage of our compensation that is salaries, it's a minor difference versus what it used to be. So I think our ability to manage our compensation expense is still quite high. What was the second question, Meredith?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Meredith Ann Whitney - Meredith Whitney Advisory Group LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">The non-comp is persistently high. How much is that --</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Oh, I'm sorry. That's related to hedge. Look, I think there is actually a fair amount of non-comp that is related to hedge, but the second biggest expense after compensation is really a step function expense because it's occupancy. And you have a building or you don't have a building. Most of our buildings are big buildings. And so if we cut some hedge in New York, that wouldn't cut our occupancy expense. There's lots of other non-comp expenses, like travel and telecom and market data and all kinds of things like that, that go with headcount, but one of the biggest expenses does not.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Meredith Ann Whitney - Meredith Whitney Advisory Group LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. So my final question is a strategic question around your asset management business. This is -- it's been fine, but it hasn't been a shining star. It would seem now, that would be a business that you would gravitate towards maximizing every potential profit opportunity, every potential growth option. What are you doing in that area?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">We continue to invest in the business. We think it is a very important business for Goldman Sachs. We think that within the context of the firm, it has the most stable revenues of the businesses we're in. We think that's important. We think that our client relationships give us great opportunities to gather assets. We think that our private wealth business within asset management is a really, really important asset-gathering business and a really, really important business. So we think, look, it's one of the few businesses -- and we know we're not the leader in that business -- and we have real opportunities to grow, and we're very focused on doing that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question comes from the line Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Christoph M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes. I want to talk a bit about the share purchase reauthorization increase. And first of all, did I hear you correct to say that, that 90.8 billion -- million shares is for between this fiscal year or for 2011? Or does it...</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">That's the total authorization that we have now from the board, not -- from our board's authorization, that's not the Fed's authorization. That's our board's authorization. That's the total that we can buy back over time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Christoph M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. So there's no specific time limit.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Christoph M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. Then philosophically, do you view share repurchases as being limited by the amount of earnings the you generate in a period, meaning the buybacks would be less than you generate? Or could you imagine that in a world where your stock prices, abnormally low compared to historical trading ranges, have tangible book, that you would buy back more capital than you earn in a period?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes, I -- yes, we could do that. I could imagine we would do that. We're not terribly anxious to decrease our capital, and I don't think we would do it dramatically. But yes, in an environment exactly like you described, I think we absolutely could, and very well might, buy back more than we earned in a quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question comes from the line Mike Mayo with CLSA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">If I can just pull the lens back, why did you take so much less risk this quarter? Why did you bring VaR in so much? I'm guessing it's due to the economic uncertainty, but was it also due to some of the regulatory uncertainty?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">It had nothing at all to do with regulatory uncertainty. It was the economic uncertainty and the difficulty we had in managing the clients' revenue inventory that we had. And we just thought it was prudent given that uncertainty, and the fact that a lot of the uncertainty was caused by political factors that were really, in our view, beyond analysis, caused us to do it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And can you compare or contrast the U.S. versus Europe versus Asia? When you had wider spreads in the U.S. a couple of years ago, you benefited. I'm assuming you had some wider spreads in Europe, and I just wondered if you benefited from there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Part of the issue, for us at least, as I said with that -- a lot of what was happening in the markets, at least, it felt to us, were not driven by the underlying economic issues but by political issues. Markets were moving based on statements. That's very hard for us to analyze, and we found it hard to take advantage of.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Is that still the case? Because you say the first few days are going better in the third quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I think there's still plenty of that out there. As I said before, our risk remains pretty low, but the performance has been a little bit better. But please remember my caveats about it only being 10 days, and things could change.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And then, separately, how much capital would be freed up if you cleared through a clearing house with your OTC derivative positions? Or at least, how much capital is allocated to the OTC derivatives positions in Basel III terms?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Mike, I think the number is about $11 billion or $12 billion, but we'll come back to you to confirm that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. So that's how much you have allocated now?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Or in that range. So how much, even as a percentage, do you think you could free up if you go through a clearing house? I mean, is it 1/2, 1/4 or 1/3?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">It depends on what the rules are, what the capital charges are and what -- and how much we clear. So I don't know how to answer the question until we have more clarity on the rules.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">In the past, you implied it would be pretty significant, but you haven't put any numbers to that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">We don't know. It depends on what the rule set is.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question comes from the line Ed Najarian with ISI Group.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Ed Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes. I think this question's been sort of beaten to death a little bit, but -- and I'm not asking for a long answer. But in terms of the components of the FICC -- of the lower FICC revenue that you were seeing, sort of went above and beyond just the weak customer volume, so maybe beyond that 25% down from the first quarter. Could you give me a little more clarity, I think you're saying on the one hand, we took off risk positions. We saw what -- we took VaR down on purpose, that had an additional revenue -- negative revenue impact. But were there actual -- were there some actual inventory positioning losses that you absorbed above and beyond that? Or could you just sort of give a little more color on that lower risk, lower VaR sort of portion of the underperformance or, potentially, actually taking losses on the trading inventory?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">It's very hard to quantify. And again, I don't want to sugarcoat this and say, \"Oh, no big deal. We just took risk down.\" We underperformed in the quarter, so I don't want to sugarcoat it. Now there were reasons behind it, but we did, and I want to make sure you hear that. We did take risk down during the quarter. Hard to quantify if we had not taken risk down, what would our results have been. It's very, very hard to quantify, because it depends when and what and how, and it's impossible to go back and know that. I've mentioned every business had positive revenues. So it's not -- and that doesn't mean that on any day, we didn't have losses. We had lost days. You'll see that in the Q. It doesn't mean that certain positions didn't go the wrong way. They did. But overall, when you look over quarter, every business had positive revenues.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Ed Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So David, is it fair to sort of say then that, okay, the environment was tougher, in that your customer volumes were less. That's number one. Number two, Goldman Sachs sort of went above and beyond what other peers did in terms of reducing VaR and reducing their risk position. So that's number two. But even in the midst of that, it did take at least some positioning losses in commodities or other areas on inventory, because the hedging environment was so difficult. That's number three. Are all those 3 things fair statements for that reason, that the revenue is down versus the first quarter on FICC?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">The only thing I would adjust a tiny bit to what you said, you compared our risk to others' risk. I only know -- I only really focused on ours. We took ours down. I couldn't say we took it down more than others or less than others, but yes, we took ours down. You make that one adjustment, I think everything else you said is correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question comes from the line of Fiona Swaffield with Royal Bank of Canada.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Fiona Swaffield - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I just have a couple of questions. The first thing is I'm just trying to understand the timing on how the shares move under buyback or how you get obviously new shares for compensation. Is it -- you're saying you want to keep your shares flat. Does that mean that the reduction is just a timing issue, so we'll see new shares coming in, in the second half? And that was my first question. My second question was on risk-weighted assets and your comment that you didn't feel the need to do mitigation now. I'm just wondering what you're feeling about correlation, because some of your peers are taking quite a lot of action on their correlation trading books and seeing quite a lot of mitigation. I'm just was wondering what your view is there. And then lastly, I know we've really talked about FICC a lot, but is there a factor at all or is it relevant that the ABX was so volatile towards the end of the quarter? And does it matter? Do you think there's a factor in terms of how people may have interpreted the pricing towards the end of the quarter or not?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. Let me try and do that, but I may make you repeat your third question. Okay. On share count, shares come in over the course of the year on compensation. I can't remember exactly how many, but over the course of the second quarter, for example -- we can get back to you, but some number of shares came into share count during the second quarter. Those were part of our calculation of share repurchased during the second quarter. The same thing will happen in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter, and it happens throughout the course of the year. So compensation shares -- and we're happy to do offline and talk to you about how the accounting works on that -- come in over the course of the year, and we try and buy back at least that much so that we keep our share count each quarter flat. Second, on correlation, that's what I was talking about before with all kinds of structure credit and tranched credit are probably the things that are affected most by the Basel rules. And what I would tell you there is there's just not as much activity there as there has been in the past, and we'll be probably less aggressive in doing new trades there. And can you repeat the third question on the ABX?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Fiona Swaffield - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Can I just come back to that correlation? But some banks seem to be saying they're actually taking action to reduce their business significantly than take away legacy, just to downsize it in advance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I understand. I told you kind of what our thoughts were there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Fiona Swaffield - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. And then I'm just wondering about volatility in the index and whether there's a factor in terms of how could it move so quickly. Some of the pricing was so crazy toward the end of the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Well, I would say just a little differently. I think you saw a pretty precipitous decline in the price of non-agency residential mortgages over the course of June. So I think the ABX was just an indication of that, but I think you did see prices decline in non-agency mortgages over the course of the latter part of the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question comes from the line Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo securities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Just one final question, hopefully, on the more challenged European economies. In the first -- at the end of the first quarter, according to regulatory data, you all have what appears to be gross exposure to those 5 countries at about $10 billion focused in 2 of those countries. In the -- at the end of the second quarter, was that \"gross exposure\" materially different?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I actually -- not trying to not answer, I don't have that information with me. I know the net, but I don't know the gross.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. And very small administrative question. What was the DVA amounts in the trading numbers this quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Oh, sorry. It was less than $100 million, and it was probably 60-ish percent and, in fact, up 40% in equity, something within that range. It was less than $100 million. It was very small.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And just pulling the plane up a little bit, do you have any comments related to what the effect on your business might be from a downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit. And some of the comments that Treasury Secretary Geithner made earlier this week seem to suggest a -- maybe a return to a more adversarial relationship with the financial services sector. I'm just curious as to your thoughts about are we going back to a more -- a tougher environment with DC.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">First of all, I'm not going to make a lot of comments on what would happen if there was a downgrade of the U.S. I just hope that it gets resolved, and I suspect that at some point, it will get resolved. And no, I don't see a tougher environment between financial services and DC. I think the regulatory community is trying to do the right thing and get things right and do things that are going to protect the financial system going forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">At this time, there are no further questions. Please proceed with any closing comments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Dane Holmes</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Thank you, everyone, for joining us for our 2Q earnings call. If you have any incremental questions, please feel free to contact us at the Investor Relations department, and we'll be happy to respond. Thank you, and have a nice day.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude The Goldman Sachs Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call.

My name is Dennis, and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to The Goldman Sachs Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Also, this call is being recorded today, Tuesday, October 18, 2011. Thank you. Mr. Holmes, you may begin your conference.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Dane Holmes</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Director of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm's belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain and outside of the firm's control. The firm's actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our current annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 2010.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets and global core excess. And you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that is posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">This audiocast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Our Chief Financial Officer, David Viniar, will now review the firm's results. David?</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thanks, Dane. I'd like to thank all of you for listening today. I'll give an overview of our third quarter results and then take your questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Net revenues in the third quarter were $3.6 billion. Net earnings were negative $393 million, and earnings per diluted share were negative $0.84. The third quarter continued to be dominated by concerns surrounding the weakened state of the global economy. The market was particularly focused on sovereign risk within the Eurozone, specifically the risk of contagion from smaller GDP countries like Greece to larger GDP countries.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Market participants are also focused on how heightened sovereign risk will impact the banking system within the Eurozone and beyond. The uncertainty surrounding the potential policy responses to these complex issues have amplified the level of concern among market participants. The price performance within European markets was a strong indicator of market fears, with the EURO STOXX 50 down 23% during the third quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">As would be expected, the Eurozone concerned heightened worries regarding the implications of these challenges on economic prospects in the U.S. Similar to Europe, equity and debt markets reflected increased fears about the U.S. economic outlook. The S&amp;P 500 declined 14% and the VIX increased to its highest level in more than 2 years. Ultimately, economic concerns within Europe and the U.S. permeated investor sentiment within growth markets as demonstrated by Hang Seng, Bovespa and Shanghai composites, posting quarterly declines of 21%, 16% and 15%, respectively. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Faced with a challenging global economic outlook, CEO confidence and investor sentiment remained under pressure. Whether it was a volatile and unpredictable market that made new equity issuances very difficult to execute, our asset management clients having much less conviction on investment decisions, the broader environment served as a significant headwind to clients moving forward with their business objectives.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">As we've said in the past, the firm's opportunity set begins with the client's decision to transact, a decision which has historically been correlated to a growing economic environment. A growing economy is also correlated to increasing asset values and positive revenues from our Investing &amp; Lending activities. Not surprisingly, the macro challenges in the quarter drove lower levels of client activity in Investment Banking and certain FICC businesses and a significant decline in asset values within our Investing &amp; Lending portfolio, resulting in a third quarter loss.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Despite the negative revenues in our Investing &amp; Lending business this quarter, we have a strong track record as an investor and our position to the product of long-term investment decisions. We entered into these positions with a focus on meeting our client's needs for financing, supporting key strategic relationships and generating long-term returns for our clients and shareholders.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">The firm also has a full understanding of the fair value implications of these investment decisions, and our third quarter results reflect falling asset prices and are unrealized. Given the significance in complexity of the economic issues facing governments and regulators, we are, of course, cautious about the near-term outlook for our business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">And while we are clearly disappointed about our third quarter results, we remain optimistic about the medium- and long-term outlook for Goldman Sachs. Our global clients continue to place significant value on our services, whether acting as a merger advisor or as a financial intermediary. We will continue to focus on serving our clients' needs and managing shareholders' capital prudently, a commitment which we believe is central to our long-term value proposition.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">I'll now review each of our businesses. Investment Banking produced third quarter net revenues of $781 million, down 46% from second quarter results. Third quarter Advisory revenues were $523 million, down 18% from the second quarter, reflecting an industry-wide slowdown in completed M&amp;A transactions. We advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the third quarter, including Petrohawk Energy Corp.'s $15.1 billion sale to BHP Billiton, Phadia AB's $3.5 billion sale to Thermo Fisher Scientific and GE Energy's $3.2 billion acquisition of Converteam Group. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We also advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the third quarter, including Nalco Holdings' $8.1 billion merger with Ecolab, ING's EUR 2.7 billion sale of its Latin American insurance and pension operations to GRUPOSURA and Drogasil's $1.2 billion merger with Raia.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Third quarter Underwriting net revenues were $258 million, down 68% sequentially as the more challenging market backdrop significantly reduced new issuance activity. Equity underwriting revenues of $90 million were down 76% from the second quarter, reflecting lower volumes in a volatile and declining equity market. Debt underwriting revenues decreased 61% to $168 million, reflecting sharply lower leverage finance activity and more muted investment-grade issuance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">During the third quarter, we participated in noteworthy underwriting transactions, including ANZ Banking Group's $1.4 billion convertible preferred offering, Carlyle Group's $1 billion sale of a portion of its equity stake in China Pacific Insurance Company and Intel's $5 billion debt offering. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Our franchise remains strong, as demonstrated by year-to-date global LEED table standings, where we ranked first in announced M&amp;A, equity and equity-related common stock offerings and IPOs. Our Investment Banking backlog increased compared with the end of the second quarter of 2011.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to Institutional Client Services, which is comprised of FICC and equities client execution, commissions and fees and security services, net revenues of $4.1 billion were up 16% from the second quarter as activity levels improved in certain businesses despite the continued difficult operating environment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">FICC client execution net revenues were $1.7 billion in the third quarter, up 8% from the second quarter. Our rates business increased sequentially as client flows improved in the midst of higher central bank activity and a more volatile interest rate environment. Commodities improved relative to a difficult second quarter as elevated volatility and macro uncertainty drove higher levels of business across all of our client segments. Foreign exchange revenues were down sequentially as volatility in certain markets proved difficult to navigate. Credit continued to be challenging as a lack of new issuance, wider spreads and a customer risk aversion created a difficult backdrop for hedging and inventory management.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Our mortgages results reflected significantly lower levels of client activity and the negative impact of asset price declines particularly in CMBS. In equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees and security services, net revenues for the third quarter were $2.3 billion, up 22% sequentially. Equities client execution revenues were up 45% to $903 million due to increased client activity in certain equity businesses and effective risk management of customer-driven positions in a more volatile environment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Commissions and Fees were $1 billion, up 18% from the second quarter on higher market volumes. Security services net revenues of $409 million were down 5% from the seasonally stronger second quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to risk, average daily value at risk in the third quarter was $102 million, largely flat relative to the second quarter. Our quarter-end VaR was higher than the average, largely due to significantly greater volatility in interest rate products.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Now I'll review Investing &amp; Lending, which produced negative revenues $2.5 billion in the third quarter. The firm's Investing &amp; Lending activities across various asset classes, primarily including debt securities and loans and equity securities, are included in this segment. These activities include both direct investing and investing through funds as well as lending activities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">The equity market indices such as the MSCI, down 17%; ICBC, down 35% and the high-yield CDX Index, wider by more than 350 basis points, our longer-term investments posted significant mark-to-market losses for the third quarter. Our investment in ICBC produced a greater than $1 billion loss. Other equity investments generated a $1 billion loss across our portfolio fund and direct investments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Losses from debt securities and loans were $907 million, primarily driven by wider spreads across our portfolio. Other revenues of $477 million consists primarily of operating revenues from our consolidated investment entities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In Investment Management, we reported third quarter net revenues of $1.2 billion, down modestly from second quarter results. Management and other fees were 3% lower sequentially at $1 billion. During the third quarter, assets under management decreased $23 billion to $821 billion, largely due to market depreciation in equities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which include salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as payroll tax and benefits was accrued in a compensation to net revenue ratio of 44% for the third quarter of 2011, a ratio consistent with the compensation accruals of the first half of 2011.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Third quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.7 billion, 11% higher than the second quarter, primarily due to higher brokerage clearing and exchange fees as a result of greater equity client volumes and approximately $100 million for the U.K. bank levy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Total staff at the end of the third quarter was approximately 34,200, down 4% from the end of the second quarter. Our effective tax rate was 30.3% year-to-date.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Given the significant uncertainty regarding the prospects for the macroeconomic environment, there is an understandable focus on the strength and stability of financial institutions. We, like many other U.S. financial institutions, took the lessons from 2008 to meaningfully improve our risk profile. We significantly reduced risk exposures while materially increasing our capital base, resulting in lower leverage and improved risk-adjusted capitalization.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Our strong capital levels have also positioned the firm to prudently manage our capitalization in the current environment, with the firm repurchasing 18.1 million shares for approximately $2.2 billion during the third quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Liquidity is the lifeblood of any financial institution, and given the challenged economic activity, our liquidity levels remain near historic highs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We have also continued to take a prudent approach to our European region exposures. At the end of the third quarter, our gross funded credit exposure to all sovereigns, financial institutions and corporates in Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain was $4.2 billion, which only includes the benefit of cash and U.S. Treasury collateral. Our exposure net of hedges was $2.5 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Over the past 2 quarters, the operating environment has been dominated by macroeconomic concerns which have translated into generally muted client activity and significant asset value declines in the third quarter. In the near term, several concerns need to be addressed to improve market sentiment and drive higher client activity levels across our franchise.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">While we're as confident that the environment will eventually improve, timing is uncertain. We're prepared to stand by our clients, and we'll continue to address their challenges while providing best-in-class service. Ultimately, our ability to adjust and effectively respond to our clients' needs will drive long-term returns for our shareholders.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">With that, I'd like to thank you again for listening today, and I'm now happy to take your questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p4\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">[Operator Instructions] And your first question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Bank of America.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">At some of your competitors, we've seen some fairly chunky debt value adjustments for structured products. I know in the past, you've always had a policy of hedging these out but sometimes, there has been something of an impact, and I was hoping maybe you could tell us what it was. And if you have continued your hedging policy, maybe you can just remind us about what you do.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Sure. And as you know, Guy, we do try and hedge that exposure as best we can, and it was a more significant number than usual this quarter. It was still pretty modest. It was -- the total amount was $450 million roughly, and roughly $300 million of that was in FICC and roughly $150 million in equities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">And maybe, David, you could just remind us of what you do to try to keep those numbers from being the kind of outside numbers that we've seen elsewhere.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Well, we try as best we can to have close-to-offsetting positions against our own credit spreads, not in our own names -- can't do that -- but in whatever names we got.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So you use a basket of some sort of a peer group?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">I wanted to follow up with a Volcker question if I might. Obviously, there is a draft out. It has more questions than answers. And so it's early days but I was wondering if you could give us some thought on any changes in your operating model and compliance regime that you're thinking about at this point given what you have seen.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Guy, you kind of started off by saying most of what I was going to say, which is it is early days. The proposed rule, as you said, leaves more questions than answers. In fact, as we add it up, when you add all the questions, there are over 1,000 questions that need to be answered. We continue to work through it and work constructively with regulators. We haven't changed anything at this point because, as you said, more questions than answers. We don't know where it's going to come out.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">And in terms of your interpretation of what you did see in the context of your Investing &amp; Lending business, do you anticipate material restrictions there or...</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">As far as we can see, as you know, we've already shut down our Waldorf proprietary business. So that's gone. We think that any investment in funds will be limited to 3%, and other than that, more questions than answers.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Fair enough. I have a final question on Basel III and your Basel III basis Tier 1 common target that you alluded to in the past of getting to around 11%. Obviously, you have deployed a fair amount of capital through share buybacks, which you talked about. It seems like GDP growth, as you also alluded to, is weak, and in the medium term, that seems to dampen earnings prospect. Are you still targeting an 11% Tier 1 common target Basel III basis given all of that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Guy, let me just clarify. I don't think we ever said we were targeting 11% Basel III capital ratio. I think what we said was best calculation we could do right now looking out, using consensus earnings estimates, passive -- no active mitigation, just letting things roll off, at the end of 2012, our best calculation was that we would be at close 11%. That was not our target. In fact, I think that's higher than what our target would probably be. I think if we did that same calculation today, which of course, is not necessarily a meaningful calculation because most of these requirements are in effect in 2012, the number would be closer to 10%, given largely, as you said, GDP down and earnings estimates down. But we still have round numbers best we can tell with all the caveats. It would be roughly 10% at the end of 2012.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Nomura.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">In -- I guess the question's on equity and risk-weighted assets. In the past, you've showed us that about $32 billion across Investing &amp; Lending over the counter derivs and mortgage trading and securities and trading. And the question was how -- I guess, was some of the regs changing? And then just also just the real weak environment, how quickly does some of that equity and risk-weighted assets get freed up? Is there a cyclical component to it or is most of that given to us for illustrative purposes of if something changes in the regulation, then that's how much can get freed up?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Oh, it was the latter, Guy. I'm sorry, Glenn. It was the latter, Glenn. It was -- We were just doing the calculation of kind of if that whole segment went away, how much capital would be freed up. It was not a calculation of what was going to be freed up, when. There was just so much talk that the whole segment would go away. You might let people know if you really think the whole segment's going to go away, here's how much capital is going to be freed up.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Understood. On Investing &amp; Lending specifically, you'd mentioned obviously that the losses in the quarter are all unrealized. The -- I'm assuming that the private pieces might have had bigger marks because they passed some thresholds, so I wonder if you could provide a little color on that. And then the flip side is -- knock wood. It's early. But so far, MSCI is up 6%. ICBC's up 12%. Do the same 10% rules apply after the recent markings or do we have to wait for the new Q?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Well, a couple of things. First of all, I would say that there were -- as you said, it was all unrealized as far as the losses. In fact, there were very modest realized gains on some things that we sold which actually offset it. As far as the 10% numbers go, there will be slightly lower because the base will be lower because we lost money last quarter in this, and so the overall amount is lower, and so it's 10% off the lower base but the calculation is going to be the same.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay, that's cool. And then last one, I guess, just to try to dig a little further on Volcker. I know we don't want to go too far, but I'll give you my interpretation. You tell me if I'm crazy. In the current form, the way it's written, the specific part in market making that talks about having a very limited amounts of revenue to be made from price movements of the underlying security, and they wanted all to be fees, commissions and bid ask. In my view, that's just not workable in the current market structure, and that would actually be very disruptive. Is that top of your list of questions to ask and things to go through during this comment period?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">It's very hard to pick one out that would be top of the list. I mean, some of the issues we see are -- and you've kind of a little bit alluded to this as the guy before you, there -- at least as it's now written with lots -- and I'll give all the caveats, lots of questions. There is tremendous operational burden and cost of compliance for the entire industry. Some or all of that would need to get passed through. It could result in diminished liquidity. That would hurt our clients and the markets, and we're also focused on competitiveness in the U.S. financial institutions. So I mean, those are some of the questions at the top of our mind. But as we said, there's 1,000 questions in there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Your next question comes from the line of Roger Freeman with Barclays Capital.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Let's see. I guess one question's in the VaR components. Is the -- I noticed that the diversification benefit was lower this quarter. Is that a function of higher correlation across asset classes or that your business mix has shifted a lot more into rates, which -- and actually went up and if you were more concentrated there, you'd get less diversification there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">I think you hit it more on your first part. It is of much higher correlation between asset classes. And look, I want to emphasize one thing since you raised it as I mentioned in the call. VaR was higher at the end of the quarter. As you know, volatility -- VaR is a combination of position, size and volatility. Volatility was up dramatically as we went through the quarter. I would expect, assuming we made no changes to positions at all, that our VaR would be fairly significantly higher in the fourth quarter than the third quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay. And then I guess maybe just tacking on that, I mean, what have you seen here in the last couple of weeks? There seems like there's been some decline in volatility, some decline in correlation especially across individual stocks. Do you see that bringing any increased risk appetite?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">I think it's too soon. We had -- you think of what we've gone through in a little over 2 weeks, first 2 days of the quarter or actually the first day and 3 quarters were horrendous from a market point of view, not from [indiscernible] . Then, things got a little better, were mixed. Last week, big market rally. Yesterday, big market decline. So I think there's still a lot of uncertainty and a lot of it is based on who says what on what day.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. And then in Investing &amp; Lending, can you just remind us a bit on the debt securities however you can talk about it, sort of composition of investments? Is this mostly distressed debt structured? What's in this mostly?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">The main things. It's really a combination of mezz loans. You know we have a fairly large mezz fund and senior debt. So it's really those of the 2 biggest components, would be senior debt and mezzanine debt. There's also some distressed loans in there, but the biggest components would be mezz and senior loans.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay, and last question just on Basel, the Basel III, the mitigation component of that, have you -- as you've kind of gone through this -- have you found additional ways to mitigate? And also how much is of sort of the roll forward is predicated on monetizing investments in Investment &amp; Lending?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">The answer to the -- let me do the last question. That's the easiest. It's none. And look, we continue to work through the Basel III numbers. We're really at the early stages of doing it because as you know, these rules don't take effect for several years. So we're focused much more on running the business today, but we do have groups of people that are kind of beginning to look through of how we can mitigate some of the Basel III impacts.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Deutsche Bank.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">One more question on the Investing &amp; Lending. So if we look at the balance in that business and granted it's a quarter late. It's going to be lower but I think it was around $50 billion. So if we think of the mix of the products that are in there, so mezzanine lending, you mentioned the senior debt, private equity, are you still expecting something like a 10% return in that business given the capital requirements? And so if we just translate it, the $50 billion, still like a $5 billion number over the long run. Obviously, private equity returns have been stronger than that over time. But just trying to get a sense of where you think the returns in that business still can be in this environment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Boy, it is a very hard question. I think over the long run, we'd be disappointed with a 10% return in that business. Obviously, as you said, in any quarter, it can be extremely volatile and up or down a lot more than that. But over the long run, we'd be disappointed with a 10% return, and our history has been a lot better than a 10% return.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. And then just based on the current capital levels, what you're seeing in this environment and maintaining certain ratios, the buybacks ramped up. Just in terms of outlook what you have approval for, any way to gauge that going forward in this environment?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">It's the toughest question. We have approval to do kind of what we feel we might want to do in this environment. We sit here today. It's a very stressed environment, which causes us to want to conserve capital, but we look at our stock price and we're pretty convinced that looking back, we're going to wish we bought back a whole lot of shares at this price. And so we're just kind of going through it as the quarter goes, and we'll decide what we think is prudent as we go forward. There's no magic answer to it. It's going to be judgment calls as we go through the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. And then just on Europe, you gave the updated exposures. I guess when you think about your counterparty risk, when you think about the ways that you manage that risk, requiring collateral, marking it daily, hourly, going to those clients to get collateral if you need it, just trying to understand how -- when you're in that stressed environment, and this is more of the industry, but how do you manage those risks when you can see what your exposures -- the one counterparty, but it's very difficult to see what their exposures are to other counterparties?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">You see that risk management does not start when you enter a stressed environment. It starts as you enter into transactions. And we have credit limits and we look forward, and the collateral that we're getting tends to be under agreements that were put in place when transactions were first entered into. Very difficult. When the environment gets stressed, you go to a client and say, \"We've changed our mind. Now we want collateral from you.\" So this is really part of our ongoing risk management. We make judgments about how much exposure we should take to individual counterparties but also to industries, to regions, to countries, et cetera. We set limits on those basis and we require collateral on those basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. And then last one on the expense initiative. Any update there maybe on timing and just given the outlook, whether it's from a macroeconomic outlook or regulatory pressures? And more so, I would say, on timing just in terms of where you guys are at in terms of achieving those synergies?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">We're working through them. We expect to be done by the end of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question comes from the line of Howard Chen with Credit Suisse.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Just back on Europe. I was hoping to dig deeper on the opportunity set as you all see it. I mean, if we rewound to the '08, '09 crises, the firm benefited from outsized share gains in sales and trading but then the distressed opportunity really never came to the forefront. So I guess when you compare and contrast Europe now to what we all went through in the U.S., I mean, how are the environments and the opportunity similar or different as you see it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I think it depends on what ultimately comes out of the powers to be in Europe. There's a chance that we might have an opportunity to help some of our clients raise capital, but we don't know what's really going to come out. There's a chance that we might be able to help them sell assets or possibly buy some of the assets. You said it didn't really materialize in the U.S. There were some. It hadn't really materialized in Europe but we may see some. So I think those are some of the opportunities that might happen, but I think probably the biggest opportunity for us is if they reach some resolution, which gives the markets comfort on how things in going to Europe, that you just see a higher confidence level around the markets and then more activity in general through that course.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Right. And I know to that point, client activity's weak, but have you seen any benefit from excess spreads or a pullback in risk capital from competitors in the region?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Not really because there's just not enough activity for it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay, great. And then we saw a lot of volatility during the quarter in CDS spreads for financial services firms. Just outside of DVA, CVA, just can you just remind us on what CDS spreads actually mean to you operationally? And were there any meaningful changes in client behavior, either positive or negative worth noting?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">The answer is other than we hate watching them widen, they don't really mean very much to us. They didn't really affect our funding. There wasn't a meaningful change in client behavior. We're in some ways confused and disappointed when we see them where they are, given all the numbers I talked about, given how strong our capital is, our liquidity is, the maturity of our funding, the balance sheet. We kind of scratch our heads a little bit, but it hasn't really affected anything other than our emotions. We don't like seeing it but it hasn't had a big effect.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay, it makes sense. And then finally, you noted equities was helped by the volatility, and we can see that VaR, equity-specific VaR went down. Just maybe helpful, could you differentiate between why volatility is a tailwind in a quarter like this versus maybe working adversely in a quarter like the second quarter of last year? I mean, has anything meaningfully changed in your equities business as you see it when you compare and contrast those 2 environments?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">No. The second quarter of last year was really -- I think we talked about that -- and really just specific positions that we got. Clients wanted to be in something. We took the other side and couldn't get out of it. It was really just a specific issue with specific positions as opposed to this quarter where there was just more volumes and equities were pretty high, and it was one of the business where there was more activity and volatility led to more activity and now it's beneficial to us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">A couple of questions, one on VaR just as a follow-up. You indicated that end of period was higher. Is that across the board or skewed towards any one asset class?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">It's skewed towards the interest rate category.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. So the rest of them are pretty much in line with where the averages are?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yes. That would be my expectation but remember, we're 2 weeks in, so a lot could change as the quarter goes on.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Sure, okay. And then, can you just remind us why you're not able to hedge on the I&amp;L segment?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Well, it's a very difficult question. A lot of that is our investment in our funds. That is a business where our clients basically want to be long equities, and we're investing alongside of our clients.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So you could hedge if you wanted to? There's no prescription keeping you from hedging?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">There are some places we can and some places that we couldn't. So for example, we're free to do what we want with ICBC at this point. It's completely free. Some of the equities, we could hedge but the decision's been made not to in that segment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question comes from the line of Kian Abouhossein with JPMorgan.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">A few questions. The first one is and you discussed it briefly, the issue of CDS and your CDS widening. At the same time, you're buying back stock. So how should I read this? What is the fixed income market telling you that you obviously don't think is an issue? I'm just trying to understand what is the difference from your perspective buying back stock and the CDS widening.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Kian, I'm sorry. I'm not sure I understand the relationship.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So the funding market is incrementally getting more concerned or more negative in respect to the spreads. That's what the spreads are telling us of Goldman. At the same time, you are very confident about your capital position and buying back stock. So what I'm trying to do is square the 2 movements.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Right. Look, that, as I answered before, it's one of the reasons why I'm a little confused because the CDS spreads don't seem to make sense to us given how strong our capital position, liquidity position are. We made a decision as the quarter went on that our capital position and liquidity position are strong enough, that we could use roughly $2 billion of both our capital liquidity to buy back stock given where our stock price was. And as I mentioned, as we think about this quarter, it's a decision that we're thinking about where it is a stressed environment, so our natural tendency is to preserve cash and liquidity even though we have a lot of both. And yet, we look at our stock price being where it is, we think it's extremely low, and that it would be beneficial to our shareholders to be buying back stock at this price. So I said, there's no formula for it but decision we make as the quarter goes on.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And if you look at the cash funding market against the CDS spreads that you're seeing, how do they differ?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Again, you're asking -- I mean, it's a very good question. CDS is a much more volatile market than cash. So what we've seen is less day-to-day movement in cash than in CDS. But directionally, cash spreads have widened like CDS have widened, maybe not the same, maybe not on any day the same amount and not nearly with the volatility that CDS has moved, both widening and tightening. But certainly directionally, our cash spreads have widened as well but on very, very little activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And then I compare your funding in -- that I see on the screen, relative to some of your money-centered peers, which seems to be much lower. You are implying earlier in the question that it doesn't really seem to make a difference to your business. Is that correct? and is it also correct to assume that because you're not writing any long-dated business? Should there be long-dated business, it would make an impact?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">It's had minimal impact on our business so far.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And would it be different if there would be long-dated business?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We do some long-dated business, and it might affect us versus some competitors who might have lower spreads, but we also compete on execution as well and our execution tends to be pretty good.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Last question is on counterparty risk. Have you changed the way you look at counterparty risk because clearly, there are some concern about certain counterparties in the market, and hence, one would assume that a counterparty has been constrained to certain parties or to certain kind of segments geographically?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We haven't really changed the way we look at counterparty risk. We, of course, always evaluate our counterparties based on what's going on and decide where we do and don't want to take exposures. I had mentioned many times in the past that vis-a-vis most financial institutions, without regard to a view on credit, we do so much business back and forth with the other major financial institutions that we all tend to have margin agreements with each other to make sure that credit exposures to other financial institutions never get very large, we had with our counterparties, our counterparties had with us. So we're always making credit judgments as we go on, but the way we do that hasn't changed.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. And lastly, prime brokerage. How do you see balance movements at the moment or last quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">They've been relatively stable over the quarter. We've had some ins and some outs but relatively stable.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question is from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">David, 2 quick questions. One is given the widening of your cash spreads, which I realize has not been quite as volatile as your CDS spreads and your desire to maintain liquidity, have you thought about repurchasing some of the debt that trades currently in the market?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Again, a very good question. It is something that we think about. Given our focus on liquidity, it's not something that we do very often. We make an active mark in our debt. If people want to sell us some, we buy it and we tend to sell it out, but it is something that we consider from time to time but not in a very big way given our focus on liquidity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. Just shifting the question a little bit, and I'm sorry if you went through this. I jumped on the call a couple of minutes late. Just curious about revenue trends across the geographies. And if you can, sort of splitting out some of the trading issues, was there -- were there particular -- was there particular weakness in Europe and relative strength in Asia or is that overthinking it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I think -- from the trading business, I think that is overthinking it. I think we pretty much saw similar trends, not exactly the same but similar trends really around the world. Obviously, our overall revenues in Asia were down a lot given the $1 billion loss in ICBC. But from a trading point of view, I would say the trends were relatively similar around the world.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So what is the constraint for share repurchases? What's your authorization from the Fed? I mean you're trading below tangible book value. You say you want to buy stock. How much can you buy?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">We haven't disclosed the authorization from the Fed.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">When is the blackout period?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Blackout period ends tomorrow.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Ends tomorrow?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And when did it start?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">It started towards the middle of August.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Why so early did it start?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I'm sorry, middle of September. I had a moment of going back to being in November year end for a second. I apologize. Middle of September.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Why not -- didn't it use to be the end of September? Is that for you or that for everybody?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">We black out from about 2 weeks before the end of the quarter until our earnings release. So it's about a 5-week, 5-ish week blackout period.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Is there anything else you can do to, I mean, sell off something and buy back stock you have? I mean, based on solely your comment, you think it's a good investment, probably a better investment than some other things. I mean, why not just downsize even more, free up capital and use that to buy back stock? I mean, how do you think about that trade-off?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">The trade-off is what we think the business opportunities are going to be. And while we're a little cautious right now, we're not so negative on our business that we want to sell off a lot of things and shut it down. So we're still going to run our business, we're still going to trade with our customers, we're still going to have a balance sheet and have inventory. But we are, as I said before, thinking about the trade-offs between being in a stressed environment and having a stock price that, as you said, below tangible book and a fair amount below tangible book. And when we -- I know that someday, we're going to look back and wish we had bought back more at this price.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">The CDS has widened along with everybody else, and you say it's wrong based on your analysis of it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I said it was confusing. I didn't say it was wrong. I don't believe markets are wrong. I think it's confusing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">But what can you do to help narrow that CDS spread?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I don't think we can do anything to narrow the spread anymore than we can do anything to change our stock price. The markets trade as the markets trade. We try and make sure people understand what the extent of our liquidity and our capital and the conservatism of our risk management, et cetera. And we know that over time, our spreads will follow that. In the short term, there'll be a lot of volatility. There'll be times of market stress, and we think it may not at times reflect the quality of the firm. But we're convinced that over time, it does.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And then lastly, your pace of investing in Asia and emerging markets, emerging markets have pulled back a bit. Have you had any change in your pace of investment?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Modestly, but not very much. We still think that the biggest medium- to long-term opportunities are going to be in some of those growth markets. And while just like everything else, as the world slows, we might moderate the pace a little bit, but we're still going to be investing in those businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question comes from the line of Fiona Swaffield with Royal Bank of Canada.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Fiona Swaffield - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Just 2 questions. On the non-compensation costs, I know you gave some commentary stripping out brokerage and $100 million. But there still seem to be some growth to me, and there seems to be kind of rather large other expenses number even if I take out the levy if you comment on that. And my second question was on the fact your hedge has gone down a bit more than your original plan, I think, that you gave in Q2 and if you could talk more about staff numbers. And the third issue is I know you've talked a lot about the CDS and funding, but just wondering about the elevated senior debt cost. If I look at some of your issues out there and how you feel about any rollover you've got coming off any maturities, and whether that means you just won't replace them at the current level? Or how should we think about your senior funding?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I'll try and remember. I think I wrote them down, so I think I got all 3 questions. So if I don't, then remind me. As far as other expenses, 3 things make up probably close to 2/3 of the difference: One is the U.K. bank levy; second is, as you know and we announced, we bought the rest of Goldman Sachs Australia, which we have had in our partnership, used to be called, JBWere, now Goldman Sachs Australia. So that now became consolidated. And the third was the increase in our litigation reserves, which was not a big number, but when you look at the year-over-year change, if you add those 3 things, it's about 2/3 of the change and then assorted other things that make up the difference. As far as headcount goes, so heads are down about 1,300 from the second quarter to the third quarter. We, as again you know, we sold our servicing platform, Litton, and we consolidated the rest of Goldman Sachs Australia as I mentioned. The net of that was a decrease of about 800 heads. So the decrease, excluding those 2 things, was about 500, and that is part of the expense initiatives that we talked about. And the third thing on our debt, again, that's something that we're just going to consider as the quarter goes on. We'll see what the opportunities are. We'll look at how much cash we have, how much funding, what our spreads are, and we'll make decisions at the time about whether we want to replace maturing debt. We don't have that much debt maturing over the course of the quarter, and we'll decide as the quarter goes on whether we want to replace it or want to wait for a better time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Fiona Swaffield - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Could you remind us how much you've got maturing before the end of the year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I think the plain vanilla debt maturing through the end of the quarter, I think, is around $5 billion. If it's very different, we'll come back to you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So just one quick follow-up. I don't mean to beat a dead horse here on the buybacks but if we -- should we assume after the end of the year that it's likely you'll exhaust the share repurchase so at least looking back, we can know what the authorization was from the Fed?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">The authorization we have from the Fed is for the year, so it will expire at the end of this year. Then, we will work with the Fed for authorization for next year. It's not a certainty we'll use all of it. So you'll know that whatever we bought back was within our Fed authorization, but it won't necessarily tell you that was all of it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Fair enough. And on that next discussion, there were some questions raised around the timing of the scheduled stress test and the fact that results won't come out until 1Q is nearly over. Has there been any change or any movement as a result of maybe some back and forth with the regulators there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">We continue to discuss that with the Fed, and I think we'll reach a resolution soon.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. And then last one. Given how the year is shaping up to be pretty weak and expectations are low around year-end compensation across the street, how should we think about a catch-up accrual for comp in 4Q?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">We'll see as the year unfolds. I think that right now, we're accruing as best we can. But as you said, the year is not shaping up as strong as some of the others. And again, as you know, it tends to be in lower revenue years. The percentage comp tends to be higher, but we'll see as we do our comp at the end of the year, and we'll adjust it accordingly if need be.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">At this time, there are no further questions. You may proceed with any closing remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Dane Holmes</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">We would like to thank everyone for participating in the third quarter conference call. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to Investor Relations. Otherwise, have a nice afternoon.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude The Goldman Sachs Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference call.

My name is Dennis, and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs' Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Also, this call is being recorded today, Wednesday, January 18, 2012. Thank you. Mr. Holmes, you may begin your conference.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Dane Holmes</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Director of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm's belief regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain and outside of the firm's control. The firm's actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly, materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our current annual report on Form 10-K for fiscal year ended December 2010. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets and global core excess. And you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that is posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">This audiocast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Our Chief Financial Officer, David Viniar, will now review the firm's results. David?</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thanks, Dane. I'd like to thank all of you for listening today. I'll give an overview of our fourth quarter and full year results and then take your questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Full year net revenues for 2011 were $28.8 billion. Net earnings were $4.4 billion. Earnings per diluted share were $4.51, and our return on common equity was 3.7%. Excluding the impact of a $1.6 billion preferred dividend associated with our repayment of the Berkshire Hathaway preferred stock, earnings per diluted share were $7.46 and our return on common equity is 5.9%. Fourth quarter net revenues were $6 billion. Net earnings were $1 billion, and earnings per diluted share were $1.84. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Over the course of 2011, the macroeconomic picture was clouded by several growing concerns. While the broader marketplace first began to evaluate the economic challenges facing the Euro zone in 2010, the market's focus and concern accelerated meaningfully during 2011 and persists into 2012. The discussion evolved from largely a regional consideration into a significant global issue, as market participants became increasingly worried about the secondary implications of a potential sovereign default. These underlying macroeconomic concerns have been exacerbated by growing skepticism regarding the willingness of the global political infrastructure to address the economic risk confronting the system, which was highlighted by the political debate within the United States on raising the debt ceiling.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In response to these dynamics, market volatility increased significantly over the course of the year. While the S&amp;P 500 ended 2011 essentially flat, prices were volatile, with the index's valuation ranging from up 8% in the spring to down nearly 13% in the fall. Not surprisingly, the broader environment led our clients across a variety of businesses to be materially more risk averse. The firm's perspective on managing its risk exposures mirrored the sentiment of the broader market, and consequently, our risk exposures remained low in 2011. Ultimately, macroeconomic concerns, heightened market volatility, lower corporate activity and decreased risk appetite among our institutional clients translated into fundamentally lower level of revenue opportunities over the course of the year, hampering our returns. While we're disappointed in our results this year, we remain firmly committed to supporting our client franchise, helping clients navigate the challenges ahead and managing our firm with a long-term orientation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">I'll now review each of our businesses. Investment Banking produced fourth quarter net revenues of $857 million, up 10% from the third quarter, primarily due to an increase in underwriting revenues following a weak third quarter. For the full year, Investment Banking net revenues were $4.4 billion, down 9% from 2010, due to the more challenging macro backdrop. Within Investment Banking, fourth quarter Advisory revenues were $470 million, down 10% from the third quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced M&amp;A globally for 2011. We advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the fourth quarter, including Foster's $12.3 billion sale to SABMiller, Global Crossing's $3.2 billion sale to Level 3 Communications and AGL Resources' $3.2 billion merger with Nicor. We also advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the fourth quarter, including Entergy's $5.6 billion spinoff and subsequent merger of its electric transmission business with ITC Holdings, Statoil's $4.7 billion acquisition of Brigham Exploration Co. and Health Spring's $3.8 billion sale to Cigna.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Fourth quarter underwriting net revenues were $387 million, up 50% sequentially, as new issuance activity improved relative to a more challenging third quarter environment. Equity underwriting revenues of $191 million more than doubled from the third quarter, reflecting higher volumes and improved market share. Goldman Sachs was ranked first in global equity and equity-related common stock offerings and IPOs for 2011. Net underwriting revenues increased 17% to $196 million, reflecting an improvement in high-yield issuance compared to a particularly difficult third quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">During the fourth quarter, we participated in noteworthy underwriting transactions, including Chow Tai Fook's $2 billion initial public offering, Michael Kors' $1.1 billion initial public offering and UPC's $1.25 billion combination high-yield notes and term loan offering. Our Investment Banking backlog decreased compared with the end of the third quarter but was higher than year-end 2010.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Let me now turn to Institutional Client Services, which is comprised of FICC and Equities Client Execution, Commissions and Fees and Securities services. Net revenues were $3.1 billion in the fourth quarter, down 25% from the third quarter. Net revenue generation within FICC and Equities Client Execution declined as client activity was seasonally slower and macro concerns continue to weigh on sentiment. Full year net revenues of $17.3 billion for Institutional Client Services were down 21% relative to 2010, as a result of client risk aversion and difficult market-making conditions. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">FICC Client Execution net revenues were $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter, down 21% sequentially. Commodities and foreign exchange revenues increased relative to the third quarter, although client activity levels within both businesses remained relatively muted. Our rates business decreased sequentially as macro trends remain in focus and client flows decreased into year end. Credit and mortgages remain challenging as activity levels declined across most products and a divergence between cash and derivative pricing impacted hedging and inventory management. For the full year, FICC Client Execution net revenues of $9 billion were down 34% from 2010, as the challenging European backdrop led to reduced client risk taking.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In Equities, which includes Equities Client Execution, Commissions and Fees and Security Services, net revenues for the fourth quarter were $1.7 billion, down 27% sequentially. Equities Client Execution revenues were down 42% to $526 million due to decreased client activity, particularly in derivative products. Commissions and Fees were $782 million, down 23% from the third quarter on lower market volumes. Security services' net revenues of $385 million were down 6% sequentially given seasonally lower activity levels. For the full year, Equities produced net revenues of $8.3 billion, up 2% from 2010.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to Risk. Average daily value at Risk in the fourth quarter was $135 million, higher than the third quarter, due to significantly greater volatility in the interest rate category.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Now I'll review Investing &amp; Lending, which produced revenues of $872 million in the fourth quarter. The firm's Investing &amp; Lending activities across various asset classes, primarily including debt securities and loans and equities -- and equity securities are included in this segment. These activities include both direct investing and investing through funds as well as lending activities. Our investment in ICBC produced a $388 million gain in the quarter. Other equity investment generated a $384 million gain, largely reflecting gains on public equity investments. Losses from debt securities and loans were $221 million, driven by losses on relationship loans, including the effect of hedges. Other revenues of $321 million consist primarily of operating revenues from our consolidated investment entities. For the full year, Investing &amp; Lending generated net revenues of $2.1 billion, driven by $1.1 billion in gains from other equity investments and $1.4 billion of revenues from other investments, which was partially offset by $517 million in losses from ICBC investment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In Investment Management, we reported fourth quarter net revenues of $1.3 billion, up 3% from the third quarter, as a result of $141 million in incentive fees generated from the firm's alternative asset products. Management and other fees were 3% lower sequentially at $1 billion. For the full year, Investment Management net revenues were $5 billion, relatively flat from 2010 levels. During the fourth quarter, assets under management increased $7 billion to $828 billion, largely due to market appreciation equities. On a full year basis, assets under management declined by 1%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which include salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as benefits, declined 21% to $12.2 billion for 2011 and translated into a compensation in net revenue ratio of approximately 42%. Within compensation and benefits expense, current year discretionary compensation declined significantly more than revenues. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Fourth quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.6 billion, 5% lower than the third quarter. Brokerage clearing and exchange fees declined on lower equity client volumes. In addition, we recognized the U.K. bank levy for the first 3 quarters of 2011 during the third quarter. These reductions were offset by approximately $170 million of impairments on consolidated investments within depreciation and amortization. We also made a $78 million donation to Goldman Sachs Gives, our donor-advised charitable fund. Compensation was reduced to fund this contribution. This amount is in addition to prior year contributions made to Goldman Sachs Gives. For the full year, non-compensation expenses were essentially flat.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Total staff at year-end was approximately 33,300, down 7% from year-end 2010. Our effective tax rate was 28% for 2011, down from 30.3% for the first 9 months. The decrease in tax rate was primarily due to an increase in permanent benefits as a percentage of earnings and the mix of earnings. During the quarter, we repurchased 9.2 million shares of common stock for a total cost of $908 million. For the full year, we repurchased 47 million shares for a total cost of approximately $6 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">The uncertain operating environment creates both challenges and opportunities for the firm. In the current environment, the strength of our financial and competitive positioning provides protection against potential tail events, as well as the flexibility to be proactive if opportunities arise. The challenges stemming from reduced market demand for risk capital requires a focused approach to our capital allocation process, and we continue to monitor the sizing of each of our businesses to ensure we're appropriately managing our resources. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">The more muted operating environment has also intensified our focus on expenses. While it is not possible to cut expenses as a means to prosperity, we understand the benefits of a proactive and disciplined approach, particularly if the operating environment remains challenging. In the second quarter of 2011, we launched an internal initiative to identify areas where we can operate more efficiently and originally targeted $1.2 billion in savings. We're currently targeting $1.4 billion in savings, and we'll closely monitor our expense run rate and make further adjustments as necessary. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">The uncertainty facing the macroeconomic environment and reduced opportunity set for the financial services industry has increased the importance placed on franchise strength from the perspective of the depth and diversity of our firm's businesses as well as its relative competitive positioning. We believe our franchise is incredibly strong and growing, particularly in its global scope. Our people remain a critical component in creating, maintaining and expanding our franchise and in our ability to create long-term shareholder value. The combination of our strong client franchise and our talented and dedicated global team favorably positions the firm to effectively navigate the current challenges.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Despite the difficult operating environment, we believe that significant opportunities exist through the continued expansion of our global footprint and responding to shifting competitive dynamics stemming from reduced risk capacity in Europe. In the near term, we remain committed to managing our capital expenses as efficiently as possible while maintaining our world-class franchise and our investment-critical initiatives. Over the longer term, we remain committed to driving shareholder value by providing our institutional client base with unparalleled advice and execution, coupled with the platform and the people to offer global, full-service solutions in an increasingly interconnected and complex world. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">With that, I'd like to thank you again for listening today, and I'm now happy to take your questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p4\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">[Operator Instructions] And your first question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with the Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">So just to follow up on the comments that you made right at the end, and I'm totally respectful of the need to maintain a very strong platform, but clearly fit for you and for a lot of others is seeing a pretty sustained run of considerably lower revenue generation than when you put a lot of the infrastructure in place. And given some of the regulatory outlook, lot of it, granted, is still uncertain, but with Volcker and Basel III and everything coming in, I'm just wondering how you're thinking about balancing the infrastructure you have and where you might consider resizing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Guy, that's the -- that's one of the most critical questions and very difficult one to answer. We've all been doing this for a long time and we've seen downturns before. Every time you're in one, it feels like it's never going end and that the world is different now. I wouldn't say, for example, that the environment feels worse than it felt in the fall of 2008 or necessarily after the tech bubble burst, or necessarily after the fall of 1998. So is it cyclical? Is it secular? That's a very difficult question to answer. As you saw, we try to be very disciplined on expenses. We cut headcount last year. We will continue to review the environment as we go forward. We'll continue to see where regulation openly comes out and what it will mean for the opportunities. And we'll try and balance exactly the things you said, the strength of the franchise and the global opportunity set with the current environment, and make sure we're sized appropriately. There's no scientific answer to it, though.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">I guess the follow-up to that, given some of the opportunities that might be bubbling up from the obvious weakness of competitors across the pond is what do you see happening there? And can you give us a little bit of color on whether you're seeing opportunities already, and what type of opportunities you're seeing?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Well, again, it's a little early to tell, largely because the opportunity set just isn't that great because of the macro uncertainties. Most of our clients are still very much in a wait-and-see mode, but we're starting to see some glimmers of opportunities. We're starting to see some assets being sold from troubled institutions. We're also starting to see a little bit less competition in the few transactions that are out there. So from a competitive position, it actually feels pretty good.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">And maybe that segues us into just any commentary you can give us, granted that it's very early going here in the first quarter, but how it's feeling in January to date, both relative to what we saw last quarter, but also comparable period last year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Well, I mean, if you take as a given, like an hour of caveats, of it only being the first 2 weeks, of it being early, if things can change, I can go on and on and on, it's not a high bar. But first 2 weeks of January certainly feel a lot better than the December and November period.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">And versus the first couple of weeks of last year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Probably kind of about the same as the beginning of last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Okay, that helps. Just one final question. Can you give us an estimate of your Basel III-basis Tier 1 common?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Yes. Again, with a lot of caveats, rules not done, lots of estimates, all of that, if we did it at the end of the fourth quarter, it would be a little bit under 8%. And if we roll forward taking just the consensus estimates, which you guys do, and just passive roll-off of some of the correlation and other structure credit, you get to, by the end of 2013, a little bit below 11%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Nomura.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So you won the buying back $6 billion of stock in the year, but net earnings pre the preferred dividend was $4.4 billion. How does that work -- and that doesn't include the Berkshire preferred buybacks. So just curious how that factors into CCAR and understanding the huge volatility that can happen in earnings for you guys.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">I'm not sure I understood the question, Glenn. Sorry.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">I thought -- I apologize. I thought that there was a limitation on a payout of a combined basis on dividends and buybacks based on your forward earnings projections as part of CCAR. Do I understand that wrong?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We put in what we want to do for CCAR and if that tells us yes or no. I don't think you should expect that it will be a long-term sustainable way we do things of buying back more than earnings. I don't think you should expect that to happen a lot going forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Okay. Then other small thing. Book was down a drop in the quarter, function of higher share count, even though you bought back. Is that a stock issuance thing, I would think?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">It was divesting of previously issued shares.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Okay. And you had mentioned the current year comp was down significantly more than the revenues, even though total comp wasn't. Is there any...</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Total comp and benefits were.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Right.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Is the prior period deferred becoming a larger piece of the GAAP number? And is there any point where that becomes a bigger issue? In other words, you're constantly buying back to dig out of the previous hole. It's something that I've seen at some other.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">It's actually been about flat for the last couple of years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So no big change this year in the deferred vesting or percentages.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">No. It was roughly flat year-over-year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay, cool. And then maybe one last one, David. Funding cost right now, I mean, you guys have been able to get off some reasonable deals all-in, especially some of the 50-year paper. But funding cost all-in for the industry are just a lot higher. How do you balance knowing what to issue now versus hanging out, and what happens if funding cost stay here as that rolls to the balance sheet? Is that a big impact?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Obviously, we'd rather have lower funding cost than higher funding cost. But as you also know, we've talked about it, we don't do a lot of characterizing. I mean, that's not where we make money. So while certainly, we're not happy with higher funding costs, it really has a more marginal impact on our returns because of the way we think about doing transactions. And I think we are -- we would -- we're, as you know, very conservative, and we'd probably continue funding at higher rates for quite a while if rates stay there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay. Last, last one. It's a quickie. E.U.-related concerns versus 3 months ago, better, worse, post-LTRO?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Boy. I'd say a tiny bit better, largely because of exactly what you mentioned. The LTRO showed a willingness to certainly, at least, make sure the banks are on solid footing. And a lot of work still to be done with the sovereign, so I'd say a tiny bit better.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Your next question comes from the line of Roger Freeman with Barclays Capital.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Just back on headcount expense reduction. Do you have severance costs for the fourth quarter? It looks like there were 900 or so people came out, which was generally more than we were expecting. And I'm just curious to -- was there a mix weighting between the senior partners versus other employees?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So severance costs were -- for the full year, they were around $250 million, and for the fourth quarter, only around $50 million. So it wasn't that big -- it's why we didn't talk about it separately. It's just part of our comp expense. And as far as headcount reductions, it's really across-the-board, pretty much across the pyramid of the firm.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">And just to clarify on the $1.4 billion in targeted savings. Is that still -- did you achieve all that through the efforts in 2011, or is there still some to go?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We achieved most of it. There's a small amount left to go in 2012, but most of it was done by the end of 2011.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay, all right. Then on Basel III, just following up there. One, do you think that active mitigation ultimately could bring that 11% number meaningfully higher? And second, how are you charging the debts for capital at this point? Is it on a Basel I basis or Basel III or some combination?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">On your first question, I think active mitigation can bring the 11% higher. I'm not sure I can answer the question yet how meaningfully. We're still doing work on that. As far as how we're charging the debt, that's a little bit of a complicated question. And we're working through that now, and it -- there's no one-size-fits-all yet. And we have to be careful. As you know, Basel III does not kick in for quite a while. And quite a bit of what we do is very short dated. And so we don't want to charge debts on a Basel III basis, have them turn down profitable opportunities that would be long gone from our balance sheet, long before Basel III ever kicks in. So we're really taking into consideration the tenure of what we do and trying to figure out what capital regime we're going to be under. And it's still, I would say, we're going through a transition process here.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. And then lastly, just bigger picture. Do you think about expanding ROE longer term? How would you rank order the buckets that can get you there, top line, profitability and the balance sheet, stock buybacks, and maybe how big do you think each of them are relative to each other?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">I think, in some ways, that's an easy question. I rank the top line growth as numbers 1 through 10, and then we can talk about everything else afterwards. And so, yes, we're going to be prudent in managing our capital. Yes, we're going to be prudent in managing our expenses, but our ROE growth is going to largely be driven by growing our revenues, expanding our footprint, expanding our client base and growing the firm. But we're not -- as I said in my remarks, we're not going to cut away the prosperity, but we will try and size the firm appropriately for the environment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Our next question comes from the line of Howard Chen with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">On relationship lending, there's been a debate about the mark-to-market versus held-to-maturity treatment. You've always been a champion of a good mark-to-market discipline. But I was just hoping to get your sense of, one, where we are in that debate; and two, how does that potential capital treatment impact your CCAR results for 2012.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. So it's still something that we're considering. We're looking at the accounting treatment for just, what I would call, a portion of the relationship long commitments. As you mentioned, it won't affect the current submission of CCAR at all, but it is -- the consideration is being driven by the more owners capital treatment for the fact that the same assets held on mark-to-market versus a held-for-investment basis are different. I mean, it's much more onerous for mark-to-market. So that's what driving even our consideration. You should know, and I will use this word, we are still fanatical believers in mark-to-market. Substantially, all of our assets today are mark-to-market. Our risk is managed on a mark-to-market basis. And whatever we conclude on, what I'll call, a very small portion of assets, just relationship lending, those statements will still be true. Substantially, all of our assets will be mark-to-market, and we will manage all of our risk on a mark-to-market basis. So nothing will change there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. And then separately on the Volcker Rule. As we come up on the end of this extended comment period, just hoping to get your view. What specifically would you like to see changed? And what would you deem to be a positive outcome as we come on to July and later in this year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Look, Howard, that's, again, a very hard question to answer. As you know, the rule is written with 1,000 questions. So there's a lot that has to change before the rule is done. We want to make sure that the market-making rules are not written in such a way that they make it so onerous to -- for us, and not just us, but for all the firms, to continue our market-making function and that liquidity in the markets dries up and it hurts the growth in the capital markets. It hurts overall growth. It hurts our clients. It hurts liquidity. It cost more to do business that the compliance regime is so onerous, and those costs have to be passed on. We just -- we want to make sure that nothing prevents free flow of capital and the growth of the U.S. capital markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And then final one for me. Over the past few years, you've been actively investing in the emerging markets franchise of the firm, getting a first-mover advantage. I mean, how much have you rein that back or thinking about reining that back as we head into just an uncertain 2012?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I guess, what I would say is just given the environment, we've moderated our pace of investment, but we're still investing. We continue to think that the growth markets are going to be a great place of growth for Goldman Sachs. As I said before, it's growth which is going to drive our ROE. While, clearly, it's not going to be a straight line up. We continue to -- we've talked before about that most important thing for us is growth in GDP, and we think the GDP growth in the growth markets is going to be stronger than the developed markets. That's not to say we're not investing in places like the United States. We are. But we're going to invest faster in the growth markets. But in this environment, a more moderated pace.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Deutsche Bank.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">David, maybe one follow-up on expenses. When we think about that $1.4 billion, obviously, it's tough when we think about year-over-year. But when we assume that revenues are flat in 2012, all else equal, should we be expecting the full expense base to be down that $1.4 billion? I guess, another way of saying it is just how much investment would be going on to offset that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Well, again, it's going to be a hard number to track. That assumed no change in compensation. Obviously, it was a big change in compensation in 2011 as well. So obviously, expenses are down even more than that when you add in compensation, so that's going to be a big driver as well. But from a comp flat basis, that $1.4 billion is going to be there. What goes from there, we'll just have to wait and see.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. And then just getting back to the top line. I think when you look across the businesses, whether it's cyclical or structural, it just feels like everything's fairly negative. Two things or 2 questions on that part. When you look at some of the firms pulling back in certain businesses, are you starting to see some market share opportunity or any changes in pricing? And then when you look across the capital market businesses, particularly in FICC, are there trends that you're seeing that are more structural growth versus what the current environment feels like, in one that comes up would be maybe in Europe into the shift from bank loans to maybe bonds in terms of funding or financing corporations? But any areas where you're still seeing some structural growth despite all the pressures.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Right. So on the first part, on the competitive situation, yes, we are seeing the effects of some of our competitors pulling away. But it's still very muted because there just aren't that many opportunities yet. And so have we seen change in pricing? I would say, even towards the end of last year, we saw a couple of blocked trades where I would tell you the pricing was a lot more reasonable than what you usually see in December when people are buying market share. But it was not enough examples for me to tell you pricing has changed. It was a couple of examples, but that's all that was out there. So the data points -- it was all the data points there were, but there weren't enough of them for me to reach a conclusion that pricing has changed. So that's kind of where that is. As far as trends and structural growth, again, things are so muted, have been so muted over the last half of last year that it's very hard to pick those out. I think when the world gets better, I think we'll probably see some of the things you're talking about. But it's hard to tell right now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. And then last one, just any update on European exposures. And then on the tax rate, just for the quarter, obviously low, and I think you mentioned mix. But just going forward, any changes there besides mix?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Our European exposure continues to be quite low. For the -- our total credit exposure for the 5 periphery countries on, what we'll call, a gross-funded basis with gross funded being total exposure less only U.S. Treasury and cash collateral that we hold. So that's the only offset. It's about -- total, about $3.9 billion as of year end. And net basis, which includes offsets for CDS hedges, only where the CDS is collateralized and only where the CDS is not from a bank in the same country it's hedging, then you get down to about $2.3 billion. So our exposure there continues to be extremely modest.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. And anything on the tax rate?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Oh, I'm sorry, the tax rate. No. There's nothing particular there. Obviously, earnings were lower. The mix led to lower tax rate. I would not expect a 28% tax rate next year. I expect to see more in the -- more on the low 30s as it's been.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question comes from the line of Kian Abouhossein with JPMorgan.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">David, first question is regarding management changes. If you could just address the topic in terms of why these changes were introduced.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Sure. Look, I would tell you, and this is something that I've spoken with many of you about over the last year or so, I would call this normal progression at Goldman Sachs. As you know, fewer than normal partners have retired over the last 4 years. That was especially true at the senior ranks. I mean, people at Goldman Sachs are -- have been very loyal. And through both, what I call, a financial crisis and reputational issues, the senior people of Goldman Sachs did not leave. The normal tenure, average tenure of a partner in Goldman Sachs, as a partner, is about 8 years. You tend to find 15% to 20% of the partnership turning over every 2 years. It's been like that almost through our history, and you saw far less than that turning over, over the last 4 years. And I think what you're seeing now, as I said, normal progression. David Heller and Ed Eisler, the 2 co-heads of Securities Division, who both announced their retirement, are 2 fantastic people. They are as good as any 2 people in the industry, but we have equally good people behind them. You saw we announced that Isabelle Ealet will become a division head, and she's fantastic. And it's the natural progression of people retiring and a very, very strong bench moving up.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay, very clear. And the second question is relating to your earlier comment, and please correct me if I understood it wrongly, but you mentioned that first quarter year-to-date seems to have started similar to last year. And if I look at issuance volumes, it looks significantly lower globally. What would you say is driving the quarter? And then also volumes in some areas look lower as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Look, again, very -- and please, don't read anything into what I say about 2 weeks. I mean, we're literally 2 weeks in. Yes, I think issuance volume is low, but you've seen some clients come back and being a little more willing to take risks. You've also seen a reasonable rally in the equity markets, and so I think those things have been helpful.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And if I look at 2011, you could argue it was 2 different worlds, the first half versus the second half, especially in fixed income. And looking into 2012, how would you think about fixed income, more rolled off of the second half or more that kind of environment or more the first half?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Well, first of all, in 2011, I would actually -- I agree with you. It's 2 different worlds. But I would say it was almost the first quarter and the last 3 quarters as opposed to the first half and the last half. And as far as 2012, I wish I had a crystal ball. As you know, I'm very hesitant to predict and never claimed to be good at predicting. We just don't know. There's still a lot of macro headwinds out there, with the biggest one being Europe. And ultimately, what ends up happening in Europe and whether that some of those sovereign issues get resolved, I think is going to drive a lot. On the flip side, as you know, since -- probably since the summer, virtually all of the U.S. macro data has been -- economic data has been a little bit better than expected. So you kind of have some outstanding factors there, and how it plays out, we're just going to have to wait and see.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And it seems to me that one of the issues which also came up in your conference calls regularly is the issue of credit, which was much more difficult to trade over the last 3 quarters. Do you think there's a change in the environment in the credit world, or do you think it's similar? And what's the structural change, would you say, in credit?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I don't think there was -- has necessarily been a structural change. I think it's too early to tell if there's been a change in the environment from just 2 weeks. One of the big issue in credit was big divergence in the basis between cash and derivatives, very unusual divergence with -- made it very, very hard to manage. I expect that, that will normalize at some point. But when that point is going to be, I just don't know.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question comes from the line of Fiona Swaffield with Royal Bank of Canada.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Fiona Swaffield - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Just 2 issues I had. One is that rollover, some maturity for 2012. I wondered whether you could talk through what you've raised already this year in terms of senior and how you're going to manage the rollover. I thought it was $26 billion. And the secondary is just on the cost side, the $1.4 billion. Historically, you've accrued the stock compensation to revenue ratio kind of on an even basis at 3 quarters. I'm just wondering should we kind of expect some step change given there should be some of these cost benefits coming through, or is that something we don't really know until the end of the year with the true-up?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Sure. As far as the rollover of our debt, we have -- I think it's roughly $25 billion that matures this year. And we've been in a blackout period so far this year, so we haven't raised any until today. So we'll see going forward. As far as accruals, what we will do is what we've always done, which is we accrue with the comp ratio is our best estimate of where we think our comps are going to be. And then we adjust as we get to year-end when we know what it actually is. And exactly what that's going to be, I don't know yet, but that's how we'll accrue.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Fiona Swaffield - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">But just to check on that last thing. So if you did think that you knew that x of the $1.4 billion is coming through lower, say, fixed cost, then we could see that in a lower comp ratio accrual.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">If we thought it was going to be lower, it would be lower accrual. But I wouldn't expect that that's necessarily going to happen.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Fiona Swaffield - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And can I just clarify? I think I may have misunderstood. But I think that you said that the comp -- the variable compensation under your control is down more than the revenues, so down more than 26, yet I think you said deferred was flat. I'm trying to work out the moving parts, but I -- maybe I misunderstood.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">No, I did say it was down significantly more than revenues. That's correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Fiona Swaffield - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So what would the other -- if deferred is flat, so i.e. fixed salaries are up a lot, so maybe it's something to do with severance? Is that the moving...</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Well, no, no, that's -- if deferred comp is flat, and then obviously, the -- and the whole amount was down 21% and part of it was not down at all, then the rest of it has to be down a lot more than 21%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question is from the line of Jeff Harte with Sandler O'Neill.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Jeffrey Harte - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">You mentioned that the backlog was down sequentially but up year-over-year. It seems, for a while now, we've had a very strong supply side kind of the backlog, but a lack of demand or ability to get deals done. Are you seeing the supply side of things still hang on as far as companies are eager to do things? It's just a matter of demand picking up or even -- is even the supply side waning a little bit?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I think it's both. I think, for example, and I may have this a little wrong, but I'm not far off, I think filed IPOs are the highest they've ever been, or close to if not the highest they've ever been. And it's just a question of the markets being receptive to the deals, so a lot of that. As far as the M&amp;A backlog, I'd say there's more a lot of dialogue and companies circling each other and talking and wanting to do things. But even on getting things announced until people pull -- are a little bit more confident, I don't think they're going to pull the trigger. So it's a combination of those 2 things.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Jeffrey Harte - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. And could you talk a little bit, geographically, about the competitive environment? I'm thinking -- I mean, headcount reductions in the industry certainly seem to be more U.S.-centric. How are some of the emerging markets? I know there are still higher growth areas trending as far as competition for talent and competitors in general.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I think there is always high competition for the best talent. Is there the same -- obviously, given the industry slowdown, is there the same level of competition for everyone? The answer is probably no. But for the best people, for the really good talent, there is a high level of competition within -- from our traditional competitors. There's a high level of competition from what you call the shadow banking industry, from other places. And there are -- it's true outside the U.S. and in the U.S.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Jeffrey Harte - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And have you seen a -- I mean, the competition is always there, but have you seen any kind of a trend change over the last, say, 6 to 8 months where things have been difficult?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">No.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Jeffrey Harte - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. And then finally, the relationship lending in the quarter. This is the first time I remember you disclosing how big that loss or the impact was. Is that a function of it not having been material enough before? Is it something new for the way you're accounting? And I'm just wondering why, this quarter, we're hearing about it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">It's the former. It was so material within the context of the whole number that we decided that should be disclosed. And before, it wasn't.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">A couple of questions. One, kind of housekeeping issue, but it's on the Investing &amp; Lending segment. So the debt marks had the impact of a hedge. And I guess I just wanted to understand how much the hedge impacted the debt section of the I&amp;L both this quarter and last quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">The hedge on the relationship lending?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">In the quarter, although there was a lot of volatility because of the basis between the hedges, as well as versus the cash positions, over the course of the quarter, the hedges had very little -- the hedges versus the marks had very little effect. It was really almost all just the day one marks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. And versus last quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I don't have last quarter in front of me. We'll get back to you on that one.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. And then just on capital return. I know you mentioned that you submitted your request. One of the things that I've said looks at is sustainability, predictability of earnings. So I guess, I\u2019m just wondering how you present that to -- how you present your capital request to the fed, given the volatility that we're seeing in the industry right now. Do you just kind of shoot for the low end of the range, or you're just very conservative in your outlook for earnings? I'm just trying to understand how you think through that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">We make our best estimate given the economic environment that is prescribed. So the thing that really causes the most volatility in earnings is the economic environment. If you give us an economic environment, if that economic environment actually happens, we can get relatively close on where we're going to come out. Obviously, there's going to be variability. It's not going to be exact. The thing that causes the variability, really, is the change in economic environment. So for a given economic environment, we make our best prediction.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. And then you mentioned that you've got expectations for common Tier 1 under Basel III going to just under 11% by the end of 2013, which is based, in part, on estimates, right, consensus estimates.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So to the degree economic environment is still why the consensus estimates comes down and we should expect that you're going to be hitting a lower number than that sub-11% by the end of 2013.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes. If earnings were lower on that calculation, our ratio would be lower. And if earnings were higher on that calculation, our ratio would be higher.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So just a couple of quick questions. One, a follow-up on one of Glenn's questions here. For the recently submitted CCAR, can you help us understand how you came up with your projection for 2012 pre-provision net revenue, and maybe whether or not the fed has given you any guidance on the numbers that they look at when they come up with their own set of projections for a firm like Goldman?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">As I mentioned, we -- both the fed gives us certain economic environments, both in a base and a stress case. We also have our own based on conversations with our economists. We come up with our own economic scenario. We then do a very detailed analysis going business by business and what we think our results will be given those economic scenarios, and that's what we submit.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And has the fed given you any color on how they think about it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Well, they gave -- they have economic scenarios as well. So there's ours and their economic scenario. And based on those, we put in submissions on both.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. And then on a different sort of issue. Given some of the drying up of liquidity in certain fixed income markets with dealers holding less inventory and that oligopolistic nature of institutional fixed income asset management business, do you think that there's an increase in risk that you could end up seeing some disintermediation from the buy side and just using dealers less often and just interacting between each other?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. I think that the market-making function that we and others perform is a very, very valuable function for our mutual fund, hedge fund, corporate, et cetera, clients to be able to access markets as quickly as they want to, to be able to get prices on things they want to buy and sell very, very quickly when they want to do it. I think that the ability to do that directly is going to be hard. I think people would have to be set up in a way that they're not set up now to execute at a speed that they're not set up to execute and to have a liquidity that they don't have right now. So I think that the function that we and others perform in providing that liquidity market is going to remain a very valuable function.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Just a question on your international revenue trends in the fourth quarter. I'm just curious as to -- were they substantially different enough to change the relationship of the international revenues relative to the U.S. revenues in the quarter? And I guess, looking forward, how are you thinking about that relationship over the next year or 2?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So look, it's a little hard because of certain factors. So for example, our Asia revenues, as a percentage, were much higher in the fourth quarter than the third quarter, but that's partially because ICBC was up nearly $400 million in the third quarter and down $1 billion -- no, I'm sorry, in the fourth quarter and down $1 billion in the third quarter. So that really accounted for most of the change. As far as kind of a trend, I would expect that -- we've been running for the last few years between 50% and 60% in the U.S. and between 40% and 50% outside U.S. with variability around that, largely because of things that I just talked about, I would expect that to trend more towards 50% in the U.S. or maybe even less and the rest outside U.S.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Right. So that's not very different from what you've been seeing for a while. I guess I'm just curious in the Trading and in Investment Banking businesses, maybe excluding Investing &amp; Lending.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I think we'll trend towards a little less than 50% in the U.S. and a little more than 50% outside the U.S.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. And then just a administrative question. In terms of the DVA, CVA effects the quarter, you noted on the release that they were effectively minimal. What benefit did you get this quarter from some of the hedging that you said you did in the third quarter from -- on that exposure?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">It largely didn't matter. Our spreads were pretty flat quarter-over-quarter. So with or without hedging, it was pretty much -- the whole amount was about $20 million. So it didn't really matter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So you've had the best loan syndications in the industry, I guess, in about a couple of decades. Is some of that activity reflecting a slot from the capital market to loans, or why are you seeing that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Mike, I missed the beginning of what you said. We've had the best --  I didn't hear what you say is the best something in a few decades. I didn't hear what you said.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">The best loan syndications in the industry in 2 decades. So my question is, are you seeing that in less fixed income or bond issuances or some of those bonds going to loans? Or do you have any color on that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I'm sorry. I'm still confused. The best loan syndications in a couple of decades?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yes, the loan syndication activity for the industry in 2011 was some of the highest you've seen in about 20 or 21 years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And my question is, are you seeing activity move from capital markets back to loans?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Well, yes. I actually think that was largely structural. There was just a lot of cash available for loans. And so I think people took advantage of that. I don't necessarily think that's going to be a trend.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. So you would expect -- no, that's fine. Let me go to the capital question. Where are you leaning right now? Are you leaning toward having higher capital levels for a perception of greater stability of Goldman Sachs, or are you leaning toward, hey, let's buy back a lot more stocks because we're trading below book value?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">You and I have talked a little bit about this before, Mike. It's a very hard question, and it's not a science. We sit here with our stock price where it is. And as I said to you, I am relatively certain that at some point in the future, we're going to wish we bought back a lot more stock at this price. Yet the flip side is it's a very tough environment, and in a tough environment, we tend to be very conservative and want to hoard cash and hoard capital. And so we make the -- those 2 things you mentioned are offsetting thoughts that we have, and we just try and make the best decision we can in the environment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Well, if you feel a teeny bit better about Europe, would that mean you'd lean a little bit more toward buybacks?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I should emphasize teeny in how much better I feel.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And then lastly, your revenue weakness recently. Are you saying none of that is due to secular factors? It's all cyclical. There's no structural changes that's hurting your revenues.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I never make -- I shouldn't use never. I don't like to use the word never. I don't make statements that bold, and I couldn't say that. I think that we are clearly in a cyclical downturn. There is less activity. That is cyclical. That will come back. I have no idea when, but it will come back. Over time, there have always been secular changes in our business, and I think we'll go through some secular changes now in how we deliver our services. I think the services that our clients want that -- you've heard us talk about this. The advice, the capital, the liquidity, the risk management, the asset management, I think those services are still going to be the same services. I think there will be a cyclically higher demand for those services than there is now, and there might be some secular change in how those services have to be provided. And our job is to make sure that we're able to provide them in the way that we'll be able to and will be required going forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Let me try one last time. Your ROE target of 20%, I know you don't have an ROE target now. Do you think you'll have one in the future, once you know what the capital rules are?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yes, I think we will.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And would the sole adjustment to that ROE target be based on the capital? So if you have to hold 1/4 more capital then your ROE would go from 20% down to 15%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">No, it would be a combination of changes in capital requirements and changes in what we view as the opportunity set going forward. So that's why I can't give you the number now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question is a follow-up from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yes, just a follow-up. You mentioned the sub-11% on 2013 for common Tier 1. What's your estimate for the 2012 year end?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I -- Betsy, I don't have that now. We'll get back to you on that as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. Because I think in the past, you had said sub-10%. And just wondering if you're still there or not.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I'll come back to you. I don't think it's going to be far from that, but I'll come back to you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question is a follow-up question from the line of Roger Freeman with Barclays Capital.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Just a couple of quick ones. The repurchases, do you have any remaining authorization from last year that you can do in the first quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yes. We have a small amount remaining that we can do in the first quarter, but it's pretty small.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. And on the SIFI buffer. And I know it's not finalized yet, but do you have any reason -- is there any reason why you shouldn't expect 200 basis points for you?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Well, we read in the paper that it was going to be 150 basis points. We don't know any more that than what we read in the paper.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. Oh, and just lastly, on VaR. The interest rate VaR, you've noted that, that was up because volatility was up a lot. Did you actually -- did you reduce risk and interest rates, or did you increase for VaR just in the quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So if you remember, at the end of third quarter, I told everybody that you should expect our VaR to be higher in the fourth quarter because volatility was already up and our ending VaR was higher than it was in the third quarter. So we knew that this was going to happen because volatility was so much higher.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And at this time, there are no further questions. Please proceed with any closing remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Dane Holmes</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I'd like to thank everybody for joining us for our fourth quarter earnings call. If you have any incremental questions, please don't hesitate to contact us at Investor Relations. And otherwise, enjoy the rest of your day. Thanks.

I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs' First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Also, this call is being recorded today, Tuesday, April 17, 2012. Thank you. Mr. Holmes, you may begin your conference.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Dane Holmes</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Director of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm's belief regarding future events that by their nature, are uncertain and outside of the firm's control. The firm's actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our current annual report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended December 2011. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets and global core access. And you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that is posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">This audiocast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent. Our Chief Financial Officer, David Viniar, will now review the firm's results. David?</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thanks, Dane. I'd like to thank all of you for listening today. I'll give an overview of our first quarter results and then take your questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">I'm pleased to report solid first quarter results for the firm. Net revenues were nearly $10 billion and net earnings were $2.1 billion. Earnings per diluted share were $3.92 and our annualized return on common equity was 12.2%. For Goldman Sachs, our opportunity set begins with our clients. In the wake of the financial crisis, our clients faced a series of challenges that accelerated in 2011. For both corporate and investment clients, shifting and often conflicting economic data created uncertainty about the outlook for the global economy. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Evolving clarity was complicated by the degree of interdependence among different regional economies. As would be expected, these macroeconomic concerns were reflected in the global Capital Markets, as market participants became increasingly concerned about the economic environment, particularly related to the potential systemic risks presented in Europe. The situation was exacerbated by growing skepticism regarding the willingness of the global political infrastructure to address the economic risks confronting the system. These factors resulted in periods of unprecedented volatility asset values and bouts of prolonged illiquidity, often sparked by perception or conjecture rather than fundamental analysis or actual facts. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Ultimately, economic uncertainty, market volatility and systemic risk factors had a materially negative impact on market psychology in 2011. While macroeconomic challenges persist, there have been some positive developments over the last few months. At the end of December, the European Central Bank announced that it would enhance its long-term refinancing operation to provide term liquidity. By addressing potential funding risks, the ECB materially reduced the markets concern that a systemic event could emanate from a European financial institution. In addition, the market has seen steady progress in 2012 on resolving Greece's debt situation, providing greater comfort that there will be a difficult but organized approach to addressing sovereign issues within the euro area. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In response to these critical events, Capital Markets rallied significantly in the first quarter of 2012. Credit markets improved materially, experiencing tighter spreads, higher activity levels, increased new issuance and most importantly, improved market liquidity. Global equity markets also rallied during the first quarter, with the S&amp;P 500 up 12%, the FTSE up 14.2% and the Hang Seng up 11.5%. Volatility was materially lower as demonstrated by the VIX declining by 1/3. While there were positive developments, announced M&amp;A volumes remained light and equity volumes remain muted, reflecting the longer time required to improve CEO confidence and investor conviction. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Ultimately, the more favorable operating environment, combined with the strength of our diverse global client franchise to create an improved opportunity set for Goldman Sachs in the first quarter of 2012.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">I'll now review each of our businesses. Investment Banking produced first quarter net revenues of $1.2 billion, up 35% from fourth quarter results. First quarter Advisory revenues were $489 million, up 4% from the fourth quarter. Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced M&amp;A globally for the year-to-date. We advice on a number of important transactions that closed in the first quarter, including Hitachi Global Storage Technologies $4.8 billion sale to Western Digital Corporation, Temple-Inland's $4.3 billion sale to International Paper, and Transatlantic Holdings $3.4 billion sale to Allegheny. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We're also advised on a number of significant announced transactions, including TNT Express' EUR 5.2 billion sale to United Parcel Service, Tyco International's $4.9 billion merger of its flow control business with Pentair and Apaches $2.9 billion acquisition of Cordillera Energy Partners. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">First quarter underwriting net revenues were $665 million, up 72% sequentially. Equity underwriting revenues of $255 million were up 34% from a weak fourth quarter, reflecting an increase in secondary offerings as IPO activity remained light. Debt underwriting more than doubled to $410 million reflecting higher industry-wide debt issuance. During the first quarter, we participated in many noteworthy underwriting transactions, including Priceline's $1 billion convertible offering, Seadrill's $1 billion secondary offering and Clear Channels $2.2 billion high-yield offering. Our Investment Banking backlog remained unchanged from year-end levels.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Let me now turn to Institutional Client Services, which is comprised of FICC and equities client execution, commissions and fees and securities services. Net revenues were $5.7 billion in the first quarter. Our FICC and equities client execution businesses produced significantly stronger results than during the fourth quarter, driven by an overall improvement in market sentiment. FICC client execution net revenues were $3.5 billion in the first quarter, improving significantly from a weak fourth quarter. This quarter's results reflected a broad contribution across our businesses and products. Our rates, credit and mortgage businesses benefited from higher client activity levels following the LTRO, the improved outlook for the U.S. economy and the orderly restructuring of Greece's debt. Our currency's business benefited from stronger performance in our emerging markets businesses. Commodity results reflected lower volatility levels, which drove fewer opportunities during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees and securities services. Net revenues for the first quarter were $2.3 billion, up 33% sequentially. Equities client execution revenues doubled to $1.1 billion, largely reflecting higher net revenues within our Derivatives businesses. Commissions and fees were $834 million, up 7% from the fourth quarter on higher market values in Europe and Asia, and higher volumes in options and futures. Securities services net revenues were $367 million, were down 5% sequentially.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to risk. Averaged daily value at risk in the first quarter was $95 million, down 30% relative to the fourth quarter. Lower interest rate risk was driven by lower levels of volatility. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Let me now review Investing &amp; Lending, which produced net revenues of $1.9 billion in the first quarter. The firm's Investing &amp; Lending activities across various asset classes, primarily including debt securities and loans, and equity securities are included in this segment. These activities include both direct investing and investing through funds, as well as lending activities. Our investment in ICBC produced $169 million in the quarter. Other equity investment generated net revenues of $891 million, reflecting gains that were relatively balanced between public and private equity investments. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $585 million, largely driven by interest income and a more favorable credit market. Other revenues of $266 million were primarily driven by the firm's investment in consolidated investment entities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In Investment Management, we reported first quarter net revenues of $1.2 billion, down 7% from the fourth quarter due to seasonally lower incentive fees. Management and other fees were consistent with the fourth quarter at $1 billion. During the first quarter, assets under management decreased $4 billion to $824 billion. Outflows and money markets, and to a lesser extent equity and alternative assets, were partially offset by $22 billion of market appreciation. Now let me turn to expenses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In the second quarter of 2011, we announced an initiative to reduce approximately $1.2 billion in run rate compensation and non-compensation expenses. We increased the program to $1.4 billion over the course of the year. We have largely implemented our announced expense reductions and continue to review means to further improve our operating efficiency. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior-year equity awards and other items such as payroll taxes and benefits was accrued at a compensation and net revenue ratio of 44%, which is consistent with the firm's accrual in the first quarter of 2011. First quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.4 billion, 8% lower than the fourth quarter reflecting reduced cost across a number of expense categories. Total staff at the end of the first quarter was approximately $32,400, down 3% from the end of 2011 and down 9% from the end of 2010. Our effective tax rate was 33.7% for the first quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">During the quarter, we repurchased 3.3 million shares of common stock for a total cost of $362 million. These repurchases reflected the completion of our 2011 capital plan. Today, we also announced an increase in our quarterly common stock dividend from $0.35 to $0.46 per share. While we expect share repurchases to continue to be the predominance of our capital management activity, we have received shareholder feedback related to our dividend and therefore, elected a modest increase. The first quarter brought several favorable developments in the operating environment for our businesses. We believe the probability of a tale event in the euro area has materially declined in the light of the LTRO. In addition, the economy in the United States is showing signs of recovery. China, while potentially slowing, still remains a strong economic growth engine. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Despite these improvements, client sentiment remains fragile. In addition, market developments in recent weeks including weaker U.S. economic data and wider spreads in certain peripheral European countries; remind us of the fragility of this economy. While debt financing markets are open and equity financing markets are improving, M&amp;A activity has not yet gained momentum. Volumes improved in certain fixed income markets, but equity volumes remain under pressure and investor conviction is mixed. We believe in improving macroeconomic picture is the most significant driver of improved market psychology and a healthy, stable Capital Markets over the medium term. In the near term, the current operating environment warrants a prudent approach to managing capital and liquidity levels and a continued focus on expense initiatives. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">The last 3 years have brought a series of challenges for Goldman Sachs in the financial services industry, as well as market participants more broadly. We're encouraged by the early signs of improvement in markets and the economy, but remain cautious given the complexity of risks and challenges. Everyone at Goldman Sachs remain steadfast in their commitment to serving our client franchise. We're keenly aware that the quality of our advice and execution in today's challenging market serves as the foundation for maintaining these long-term client relationships and ultimately meeting the needs of all of our stakeholders. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">With that, I'd like to thank you again for listening today, and now I'm happy to take your questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p4\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">[Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Let me just start with the expense initiatives that you alluded to. Obviously, in the quarter, as you also pointed out, what you reported on the non-personnel side was -- indicated very strong cost management. You can look at some of those items and say, well, some of this is just discretionary spending being kind of stepped on temporarily in a -- in what's still kind of a weak revenue environment. On the other hand, you're telling us that you fully implemented your sizable cost-cutting plans. So I guess that's a roundabout way of asking for a little bit of guidance as to whether we should be straight-lining these levels of non-personnel costs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Guy, I'm always hesitant to give guidance on anything because things change. But I think that you can assume that most of those cost reductions, many of which are related to people, but non-comp expenses are attached to people, are in. And so I think that the numbers that you see are not a bad proxy. All other things being equal and no -- assuming no big changes in the environment for where things are going to run.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Okay. That's helpful. I wanted to talk about the CCAR a little bit. Obviously, your CCAR results highlighted something we've known for a while, which is that your capital position is very strong. The shares have obviously rallied meaningfully in the first quarter, but they're still below tangible book. Maybe you can articulate your philosophy with respect to share buybacks relative to the share price and the degree of price sensitivity that you may show?</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Well, I'd always like to buy more when the stock price is lower, and less when the stock price is higher. But I've never found myself to be a great predictor of our stock price. And so I'm not necessarily sure when the stock price is lower and when it's higher. We will -- we'll have a plan. We will moderate that plan, based both on our results and how things are going during the quarter, as well as on the stock price. And we'll try to buy more at the lower stock price and less at the higher stock price, but I don't know for sure we\u2019ll be successful at that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">And can you give us some sense of how to think about what authorization you may have received from the Fed as to how much you may buy back?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We didn't disclose it last year nor this year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Got to ask though.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">I thought you would.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Can you tell us what your pro forma Basel III Tier 1 common and risk-weighted assets were?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">I can tell you -- I can give you the ratio. I actually don't have it in front of me, both the equity and risk-weighted assets. But with all the caveats of the rules not being done, being very rough estimates, all of those, those caveats take as a given. At the end of the quarter, our Basel III ratio would have been roughly 8%. And if you roll forward to 2013, again, assuming just consensus estimates of earnings and passive roll-off suppositions, so no active mitigation, it would be around 11%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Okay. Then final question for me is just about Investing &amp; Lending. The outstanding levels of your I&amp;L portfolios have been pretty constant. But going forward, of course, there's going to be limitations on the level of fund commitments and maybe some other limitations under Volcker. How should we think about the portfolio trajectories there, given some of these limitations and the expected runoff of your current portfolio holdings?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Look, again, hard to answer the question because the rules are far from final. But certainly, some of our investments in hedge funds are going to come out. We've announced that publicly, and our investments in equity funds are going to be limited to 3%. And so some of those -- some of the investments where we have a higher percentage will roll-off. And so in that way, you could certainly see some of that portfolio come down. But until the rules are finalized, we don't know exactly where it's going to go.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">And just in terms of the potential capital relief as we see some runoff, I think you've spoken to about $9 billion of capital held against that portfolio currently, is that still more or less right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Right. But again, not to mislead you, that\u2019s the total capital held against that portfolio, we don't expect that whole portfolio to go away, so we don't expect all that capital to be released. And it's going to be dependent on the final rule set, how much happens and what the ultimate flows are.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Your next question comes from the line of Howard Chen with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">I was just hoping to get your latest thoughts on the competitive landscape in the sales and trading businesses. On one hand, you've spoken about the exit of some competitors in big pockets of the business. Curious if you're seeing any improved share trends? And second, on the flip side, are you seeing the competitive landscape heat up and any particular subclusters of thicker equities?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Look, I would say the competitive landscape remains tough. We have a lot of very, very good competitors out there. I can go back to 2009, where as you know, we gained a tremendous amount of share. But we all talked about -- you heard me say very clearly that was not sustainable and we knew our competitors would be back, they are. I think there are some competitors, some of the European institutions who have exited certain businesses, so that's helpful. But it's hard to really see that because there's not yet that -- enough improved flow to really see how much share we can pick up from that. I would say our franchise remains very strong. We continue to get a very, very good market share across the trading businesses. But that's not without very strong competition from our major competitors.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Great. And then a healthy start to the year, but with the environment still glass half full, glass half empty, how are you thinking of staffing levels and the hiring outlook today?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Look, I think we're relatively well positioned assuming that the environment stays pretty much what it is. But you heard me say we're going to look for other means of efficiency because we're still cautious on the outlook. But I wouldn't expect anything major to change from where we are.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Perfect. And then final one for me, given the Moody's review for you all in the industry, just -- can you share your latest views on what a downgrade for the firm and the industry means to you and the competitive landscape, if it falls out that your rating comes, lays out at a premium to that some of your major competitors?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Look, first, I would say, and I'm sure this will not surprise you, we very strongly disagree with some of the things that Moody's has mentioned in some of their reports. We think that if you look at every single credit metric there is for Goldman Sachs, and frankly, for many of our competitors, none of the actions they've talked about are warranted. We are, as you know, we're quite analytical. And when we do all of the analysis, we cannot figure out why they are where they are. So I just want to tell you that. Look, what the effect is going to be, I think much of it is in the market because they have clearly foreshadowed what they're thinking of doing. I think if they move the whole industry to the left, I think it just -- it will not, in the end, have that big an effect. There are some who might be more affected than others, at least from what they say, we'll be at the higher end, but not the highest. And so I don't think it will have a big effect. And it's hard to say that there will be a real competitive change from what they do.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Nomura.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">One of the impossible questions. So look, you guys are the only ones that breakout Investing &amp; Lending separate. There's a component, at least a decent component of it, that would be included in some of the competitors FICC numbers. But with all that said, can we drill down on FICC specifically? It's an interesting quarter because spreads compressed a lot, but you came into the quarter and then -- with lower risk rates and you took VaR down dramatically in rates and currencies. Can we just talk about separating the environment and your derisking versus looking forward to how the business is being shaped? And then, very specifically, how you think about your share within FICC?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay. In some ways, Glenn, your question included my answer. So look, you're correct about the segments. And so it's hard to compare, it's not necessarily apples and apples. You're correct about our caution. And the way I would describe the quarter is, I would say flow in FICC was good, but not great. And our quarter in FICC was good, but not great, reflecting that. There was big asset price improvement, but we were -- we have been cautious on risk and we remain cautious on risk given the environment. And I think that's also reflective of the fact that our clients have been cautious on risk and remain cautious on risk. And that's why flow, I would say, was good but not great. I think all of those things are related. Our franchise still feels extremely strong. Our market share is very high and the reason that it was a lot better than what you saw in the -- towards the end of last year is because flow and outlook was better, but still cautious.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">I appreciate that. And I'll note that you didn't say anything about future part of the business and the regulatory environment. In other words, this is all a product of your client flow and the business environment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">I think that is the great bulk of it. I think some of some of the flow or not great flow is caused by concern about what regulation might do. I think that's a very small part of it. I think most of it is macroeconomic driven.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. I appreciate that. After the quarter, there were some news stories on ICBC sale. Just curious if you -- it wasn't all of it, just wondering how much is it in the funds? How much is it, the Goldman piece and what's left after the latest sale?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Sure. The simple answer is, there is nothing different about this than the prior sales. It was purely a derisking sale because our position was quite big. We still have a position that at current market prices is a little bit less than $2 billion. We remain very optimistic about ICBC and about China. We remain very committed to both strategically, and we would expect to have a reasonable size position going forward. But it was just big and we derisked.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. Last one, and I've been through the cycle with you before, but it seems like there's been a decent number of senior producers leaving Goldman over the past couple of months and wondering if you could just put some context around that and how much time you spent worrying about it because I know it comes up in a lot of conversations we have.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Sure. And this is -- we talked about it before and I've told you that you should expect what you saw. We have statistically 15% to 20% of our partners leave every 2 years. You go back in history and you've seen that. And over the last 4 years, coming into this year, very, very few left. And I think that was a testament to people's feelings about Goldman Sachs. It was a tough economic environment. It was a tough reputational environment and our partners are completely loyal and felt that they should stay with Goldman Sachs. I think as things have improved somewhat, what you're seeing is a little bit of a catch-up. It's natural and it's actually important and it's warranted because if it doesn't happen, then the next level of people don't have, who are fantastic, don't have the opportunity to move up. And then they'll leave and then when the senior people leave, you'll be missing that middle level. And so there is nothing unusual about it. It is exactly in line with what we would have expected. I would expect that between now and the end of the year, you'll see more partners leaving. I couldn't tell you who they're going to be. It's just kind of the natural progression and our bench is so deep that it's really not an issue at all.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Your next question comes from the line of Roger Freeman with Barclays.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Just maybe just to follow on that, that question. I think you said the headcount was down 3% since the end of 2011. Is that just the holdover of some of the initiatives from last year or is that some of the departures out of place?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">No. I think it's largely the -- kind of the ends of our expense initiatives that we talked about.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. Could you also comment on maybe how -- what the headcount level delta is in the U.S. versus non-U.S., either like over the last year or year-to-date? I'm just curious what the relative growth or contraction rates are.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Yes. The contractions, I would say, were more in the U.S. and Europe than in Asia. But pretty similar across the U.S. and Asia, with U.S. and Europe with a little bit less in Asia, given our concentration on growing that business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Would you still anticipate to be growing, say, sort of outside of Europe this year, particularly emerging markets?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I would anticipate us to be growing in emerging markets, but I would anticipate that growth to be very moderate in this environment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. On the regulatory front, is there -- are there any significant items, still a lot of rules that have to be written, but obviously, a lot of discussions going on around them. Are there any major issues that you feel at this point have not been acknowledged by relevant -- either members of Congress or regulators to kind of workout?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Look, I think the regulators and especially regulators who are writing the rule understand the issues. I think they are very, very difficult issues. I think they are doing what we completely support, which is trying to write rules that make the financial system safer and sounder, while not hurting the free flow of capital and therefore, economic growth and not hurting the competitiveness of the U.S. financial institutions. That's their goal. It's not easy. The rules are very, very complicated. We're very supportive of what they're trying to do and I think they are really trying hard to do this, but it's a difficult task. And they recognize all of the issues involved.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. And then just in the equities business, I was curious on the equity derivative comments, on the Europe year-over-year, because from everything I've heard, that's been a much tougher business year-over-year particularly with the volatility down. Is there anything unusual or particularly chunky in there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">No. We actually saw more activity from our clients in the Derivatives space. And so that was very helpful to us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. Lastly, just on liquidity. $170 billion I think this quarter, I mean, given all of your comments, things, feeling somewhat better, but obviously still some points of caution, did you anticipate to run at these kinds of levels probably for the rest of the year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">We have been running at the high -- an average of the 160s probably for the last 2-ish years. I would not expect, assuming the environment does not change dramatically, I would not expect it to change dramatically. It might go up or down a little bit from here. I wouldn't expect to change dramatically.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Deutsche Bank.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your first question, when you started out, you mentioned solid results, yet it's still just 12% ROE. Now granted tough environment and tough environment for all the peers on a relative basis is still pretty good. But I think when we think about the macro environment improving and what that can do to returns, I mean we can all try to gauge that and factor that into the pickup in activity. But when you think about the uncertainty on some of the regulations that are still weighing on the industry, like how much does that limit your ability and the industry's ability to reposition in order to improve returns? Like meaning, if that -- if the regulatory uncertainty keeps getting kicked down the road, like does that significantly limit what you can do to try to improve those returns versus just the macro environment?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Look, I think -- as you heard me say before, I think the biggest driver is going to be activity and the biggest driver of activity is going to be the macroeconomic environment. You saw some pickup this quarter, and so you saw a pretty good pickup in ROE, although not something that we consider acceptable. I think there's -- look, let's just be realistic, there's going to be regulatory uncertainty for a while. And I actually think, as I said before, I think the rules are hard and I think I would trade regulatory uncertainty for better rules. And so I think the regulators are taking the appropriate amount of time to make sure they get it right. And in the long term, that's going to be better for us and better for everybody.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. And then during the quarter, I guess one is on the Asset Management side, so you did one deal. In that business, just on the long-term flows continues to see outflows. So just strategically, how are you guys trying to reposition that? And then you've also been building the Reinsurance business, so where do you see the opportunity there? And is it some firms pulling out, and you see some market share? Longer term, where are the returns there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So look, on asset management, it is still a very, very big focus of the firm. You saw the acquisitions we made were small. As we've told you, you might occasionally see them. They're really to put us in parts of the business that we weren't in before, it was hard to start ourselves. All in very small dollars, but hopefully, it'll give us a platform that we can grow up. One of the things we've seen in Asset Management is our performance in the last several months has definitely improved. And if that continues, I think that would be a good precursor to good inflows of assets. We'll have to see if that continues. Reinsurance, I would say is really just totally opportunistic. We've seen some opportunities where, for various reasons of risk management capital, some people were pulling out of the market. We thought it made sense for us to opportunistically pick up some pieces. But it's a very, very small business within the context of Goldman Sachs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. And then last thing, just a number we might have missed it. But just on the DDA, did you split that out, just in terms of FICC and equities?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">No. It's roughly 50-50 between FICC and equities. A tiny bit more in FICC than equities, but roughly 50-50.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Christoph M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I'm looking at the famous Page 25 from the Fed's March 13 CCAR publication, which shows all the banks\u2019 capital ratios, before the proposed capital actions and then after, and for Goldman Sachs, it's a very small difference. So it was 5.8% before the capital actions that you're requested and 5.7% after, which implies that it's 0.1% of your risk-weighted assets, like you only asked for an incremental of $400 million of additional return to your shoulders. And I guess, I'm wondering, a, is that a correct reading, b, that makes it sounds like the only thing you asked for was, for this dividend and not for any incremental share repurchase authorization. Am I reading that correctly?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I'll tell you 2 things. One, we did not only ask for dividends, although I'm not going to disclose how much of a share increase. And the second thing I will give you is a bad answer which is, we do not know how the Fed did the calculations.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question comes from the line of Meredith Whitney with Meredith Whitney Advisors.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Meredith Ann Whitney - Meredith Whitney Advisory Group LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I have a question that's sort of related to FICC but broader. And I'm just going to go for it, which is you talk about risk, and your risk appetite differentiated, you last quarter, the year quarter before this quarter. And maybe if you could explain your approach to risk or better articulate -- better explain with maybe some tangible examples of your approach to risk and particularly political risk. And if you comment on the YPF issue with Argentina yesterday? I mean, give me more. It would be helpful, at least for me.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Meredith, that was a very broad question. I'll try to answer it as best I can. Look, the biggest thing that drives our risk appetite is our client flow. And what our clients are doing and how much they want to do and obviously, when they do more, we are likely to end up with more risk. They're not necessarily doing that much more because they are cautious as well. Second thing that drives our risk, really, is the traders on the lines view of their ability to analyze the situation. We talked a lot about this last year, about the fact that, really, what was driving markets last year was very largely political as opposed to economic. And so because we're good analysts and think we can try to evaluate the more likely economic outcomes, and we're not always going to be right and we know that, but at least we can analyze it in a situation where it's really politics and speeches and what people are saying more than economic outcomes that are driving the market. It's very hard for us to analyze risk and makes us extremely cautious about being left with any risk. Frankly, it made our clients more cautious too and there was less activity, so we saw all that last year. That's really the philosophy more than anything else. I think the YPF situation, I don't have much to say. I think it's an isolated incident in a certain location. I certainly don't think nor hope it's indicative of the rest of the world.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question comes from the line of Kian Abouhossein with JPMorgan.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">A few questions. First of all, the Basel numbers that you indicate on the Basel III, are they x NPR2?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes. Yes, they are.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And when do you expect some kind of finalization around NPR 2?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Kian, I don't know. We don't know when the rules are going to be finalized.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And assuming the business -- NPR2 proposals are what will be finalized, how would that impact, in particular, your mortgage business and then also, I guess, your securitization business, but particular your mortgage business?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I think it would be very difficult for that business. And look, I can't give you an exact answer. But it's hard to see that business for us, or really anyone under those rules, that business making sense. And I think you'd have to see a big pull back and I don\u2019t think that would be very good for Capital Markets or for the economy. And so we hope that doesn't happen.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. Shifting to FICC, if I look at your numbers over now, I would say 6 quarters, one could make the argument that you have taken a quite risk aversion view. And the revenues, as a result, maybe against some of your peers look weak-ish. How would you or how do you answer that argument? And I'm clearly just looking at clean revenues x DVA, some of them x CVA on a like-for-like basis. How would you argue against that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Look, I think that, basically, we have been cautious. I think our clients have been cautious as well. And I think that our franchise remains very strong. We still believe we're getting a very, very high market share. We're not getting the market share we were in 2009. And remember, I told you in 2009 we weren't going to keep that market share. So I think you always have to be careful where you start. And where you go back to the remnants of 2009, if we lost shares since then, the answer is yes. But we picked up enormous share going into that and we knew we weren't going to keep it. But leaving that aside, we think our franchise has not lost share at all and in fact, it remains very, very strong.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And can you talk a little bit about this quarter, a little bit by FICC business. What were the kind of the bright spots, what's the more difficult areas? We know you're a big mortgage player, was that an area which performed very good or was more difficult than commodities? Can you talk a little bit by sub-segment just what has been performing very strongly and what's maybe a bit more difficult?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Well, without disclosing numbers because you know I don't do that. What I would tell you is, I'd say, the rates business had a very strong quarter and all the other businesses had good but not great quarters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. And lastly, in terms of investing. You've indicated a little bit on the emerging markets side, but can you talk a little bit about the key area that you see for yourself, both in terms of capital as well, in terms of what are the potential growth engine that you see? You've always been very good at looking forward and seeing where you see potential investment opportunities and profit opportunities. Can you talk a little bit about what are actually growth areas as an investment, either geographically or business segments?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Kian, I appreciate that compliment. I wouldn't actually think we're always that good at looking forward. I think we're actually better at adapting to the environment. And very good at being nimble and being able to move to where the environment is going. Look, we've told you for a while, too big concentrations are the growth markets and the whole Investment Management business, those continue to be. But we're not -- we think that over time, we'll grow all of our businesses around the world. You've heard Lloyd use the term that we're going to be Goldman Sachs in more places. We're going to do that. We're also going to grow all of the businesses around the world as the environment improves.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I just wanted to follow-up more on the buyback. Is there anything that would keep you from buying back your stock aggressively before it -- below tangible book value?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Within the context of what we can do with the Fed? No, there's nothing would keep us from doing that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And is there anything that would keep you from frontloading your buybacks even if it wasn't spread out evenly over quarters?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">The only thing would be the inability to fully predict where stock price is going and wanting to make sure that we have some powder for later in the year depending on what the environment is like.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Separately, there's been all sorts of regulatory investigations into the industry. And there was one news report saying that one investigation was complete and the article is related to the Department of Justice. And I know it hasn't come up a whole lot, but it's still out there in some investors' minds. Would we ever hear if they were done with their investigation into you or not?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I actually don't know the answer to that question, Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. And lastly, what this quarter, could you say we can extrapolate forward. You don't like giving guidance on Capital Markets and so -- I know you're not going to give any guidance there. But I guess your non-comp expenses, we could say are recurring?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Look, I think you can extrapolate somewhat. But remember, one of the biggest non-comp expenses, which is brokerage, clearance and exchange fees is activity related. So that's one that I certainly hope gets higher. If you saw that go up from a non-comp point of view, that would actually be a really good thing, not a bad thing. So there is some activity basing within the non -- even the non-comp. So all other things being equal, I think it's probably a reasonably good proxy for where we're going to go. But all other things are never equal. And so hard to predict. And as far as anything else, I don't think one quarter is at all a predictor of the future.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Well, however you look at it, if you strip out activity-based non-comp expenses, how much did non-comp expenses go down for the quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">You see them. I mean, you see what they are. And I think, as I said, given similar levels of activity, I think that's a pretty good baseline for around where we\u2019ll be.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I just want to follow-up on the capital ratio question. Just want to make sure I got the denominator right. You're presenting capital ratios on a Basel III basis, but not including the NPR, executive NPR impact?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">That's correct. That's correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. So not 1 or 2. And so when would you anticipate incorporating that into your numbers?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">When we know what the rule is going to be.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. And so I mean, it's same with Basel III though too, right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">But we have a lot more clarity on Basel III. But we'll see if that rule got passed as is, then we would incorporate it in. And we\u2019d tell you what it was.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. And then just on the insurance side of the business that you talked about earlier. Could you just give us a sense of how you're integrating that into -- not only your equities business, but also just how you're integrating that into your overall organization?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">It's run largely separately. Although our risk management is very integrated into it because there are a lot of market related risks in that business. And so our risk management infrastructure is very, very integrated into that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So it should help with your own VaR I would think, no?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">It's very, very minor in that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. And then what about funding? Does it help at all with the funding side?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">It's largely kept separate.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question comes from the line of Fiona Swaffield with RBC.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Fiona Swaffield - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I just have 2 questions. One was on the Basel III look through, and I think you said roughly 8%. And I think at Q4 it was roughly 8%. Am I able to impute, I mean I know you also caveat it with moving parts, but obviously, you're Basel I improved due to retained earnings and the RWAs going down. So has it improved at all through earnings or is it the Basel III RWA is going up? I just wondered if you could help on that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">The changes are really immaterial, that's why I gave you roughly the same number. You're talking about tenths of a percent.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Fiona Swaffield - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Is that because your Basel I RWA is going down wouldn't have been reflected in the Basel III?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Again, that is largely correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Fiona Swaffield - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. And then just trying to understand the cost number. You gave a total cost reduction number and then how do I -- I'm assuming we'll see something in salaries potentially at some point, but that won't be clear until the comp ratio -- I mean because it's not just a non-comp, is it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">It's not just non-comp at all. And you saw some of that last year in the comp line. So a lot of that is already in there and you saw it last year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Fiona Swaffield - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">But if I knew the comp, I mean, you said that would -- could there even have been lower salaries, for example, absolute salary cost in Q1 as well?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">When you say salary, I assume you mean compensation, not salary.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Fiona Swaffield - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes. I'm sorry, I'm just trying to get all -- you got the variable compensation, which is related to -- I'm trying to understand if you got a number of heads going down.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Fiona, I'm sorry, I'm not understanding your question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Fiona Swaffield - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Well, it's because of the 44% ratio. I'm just wondering if there could be a lower comp ratio because of the staff reductions that we weren't...</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">That will be dependent on how things unfold between now and the end of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I just wanted to get a quick characterization of the business condition changes in both your Asia/Chinese markets and the European markets in Q1 versus Q4. Because we've seen a number of competitors, at least their revenue numbers suggest that those numbers were up fairly dramatically quarter-over-quarter. And I guess I'm just curious if you can provide some color as to how you're thinking about those markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Look, I would actually say the Asian markets, I mean, you saw there was a pretty big underperformance of the Chinese market in the first quarter. And I think that reflected a little bit some of the activity, but the business was still pretty good. And European activity was better as you saw the markets get better.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And as the markets have sort of -- the improvement in the markets has stalled a little bit in the last few weeks has that had a chilling effect on activity within the European markets?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Look, 2 weeks doesn't really tell you anything. But yes, I think that it has had somewhat of a chilling effect on activity in Europe as markets have stalled. And we'll see how things unfold over the course of the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question comes from the line of Douglas Sipkin with Susquehanna.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">[</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Just one quick question. Just curious what do you guys think is wrong with the M&amp;A markets? I would just expect with the stock market as strong as it's been, the debt market as strong as it's been, balance sheets, et cetera, just feels like last year, at this point in time, things were a lot stronger for M&amp;A. I'm just curious if you guys have a pulse into that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">That is a really good question, because if you gave me the whole picture of the economic environment in the first quarter and said, what do you think will be M&amp;A volumes? I would have said it would be a lot higher than they were. And there is a lot of dialogue and dialogue has really continued to pick up. I think what you're seeing is, given how much economic uncertainty there has been for a while, CEOs are very much in a prove it mode. And they want to see solid growth or at least growth and resolution in Europe and things like that for a longer period than they saw it in the first quarter. And until they have that confidence come back, and it's just going to take a while longer, it's just not going to result in that many transactions. I said there's a lot of dialogue and enough dialogue that if that's CEO confidence comes back, you could see a fairly dramatic pickup in that market. But the confidence has to come back.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Would you say that, I mean, Europe is the predominant driver of that, meaning -- I said it just feels like this thing could go on for a lot longer. Or is it more of the United States or sort of non-Europe economies that are driving some of that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I would put Europe as the top of the list, but not the only thing on the list. So if you saw a whole slew of continued better economic data in the U.S, I think that could be a driver. A pickup in China, that could be a driver. But Europe is the #1 thing that's out there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I know this is sort of a tough one to answer, but I'm going to give it a shot anyway. Is there any way you could give us some color or an idea about how much of a headwind the leveraged loan market being shut, was to your FICC revenues?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I'm sorry, which market?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Levered loans.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">The levered loan market was not shut in the first quarter. I think it was -- they are just -- while there wasn't that much activity because there wasn't that much deal activity, the market was actually pretty aggressive. So I actually think deals that were out there got done and got done pretty well. And so I wouldn't call the market shut at all. I think it was just really lack of activity which goes back to lack of merger volume and lack of CEO confidence more than the market not being receptive. I think the credit markets are actually quite strong.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. And on equities, is there any way you could give some color on how derivatives\u2019 volumes held up in March and April? So what you've seen so far in April and how things are looking? I know it's early but...</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I actually don't have that, so we can get back to you on that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question comes from the line of Ed Najarian with ISI Group.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Edward R. Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">My question has been answered.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And your next question is a follow-up question from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">David, I just want to circle back on something that came up a few quarters ago regarding the potential for share gains, perhaps on share given up by some of the European banks. I seem remember that you were a little skeptical of the potential opportunities presented by forced European bank deleveraging. Now that some time has passed, have any of the investment opportunities materialize as there was a general expectation in the market we might see from the forced deleveraging of European banks?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">You mean from the ability to buy assets, is that what you're talking about, Guy?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Primarily, yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Look, I think there have been some, but not a lot. I would say we have seen some opportunities to buy assets that we think we'll be profitable to hold. We've seen some opportunity to buy that we think would be very good to distribute to our franchise and we participated in some of that. But I would call it some but muted.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And at this time, there are no further questions. Please go ahead with any closing remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Dane Holmes</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">We'd like to thank everyone for joining us for our first quarter earnings call. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us in the Investor Relations Department.

Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning. My name is Dennis, and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Also this call is being recorded today, Tuesday, July 17, 2012. Thank you. Mr. Holmes, you may begin your conference.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Dane Holmes</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Director of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. Today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm's belief regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain and outside of the firm's control. The firm's actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm's future results, please see description of risk factors in our current annual report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended December 2011.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets and global core excess. And you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that is posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com. This audiocast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Our Chief Financial Officer, David Viniar, will now review the firm's results. David?</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thanks, Dane. I'd like to thank all of you for listening today. I'll give an overview of our second quarter results, and then I'll take your questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Net revenues were $6.6 billion. Net earnings were nearly $1 billion. Earnings per diluted share were $1.78, and our annualized return on common equity was 5.4%. Year-to-date, our annualized return on common equity was 8.8%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Questions surrounding the stability of the global economy and its future prospects resurfaced in the second quarter. The situation in Europe remains a primary concern. Despite the systemic benefits of the European Central Bank's long-term refinancing operations, the market refocused on the broader sovereign challenges that remain. In particular, client psychology suffered from continued skepticism regarding the mechanisms and political will required to address the complex series of issues facing European governments. The outlook for the global economy was further clouded by concerns about slowing economic conditions in the United States and China given weak economic data during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">The accumulation of these various macroeconomic concerns increased market uncertainty and reduced client activity. For example, during the second quarter, industry underwriting volumes declined significantly, with debt and equity volumes down by 36% and 15%, respectively. Market volumes also posted quarterly declines in various fixed income and equity products. While a challenging macro environment may translate into lower industry volumes, our focus on our clients is unwavering as the advice, execution and Investment Management services that we provide to our global client franchise are more highly valued in a difficult environment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">The uncertainty has also led the firm to conservatively manage its risk profile, maintaining a high level of risk-adjusted capital and a significant liquidity cushion. We believe our continued focus on serving our global client franchise and managing our risk prudently is essential to the firm's ability to create shareholder value over the long term.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">I'll now review each of our businesses. Investment Banking produced second quarter net revenues of $1.2 billion, up 4% from first quarter results. Second quarter Advisory revenues were $469 million, down 4% from the first quarter. Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced and completed M&amp;A globally for the year-to-date. We advised on a number of important transactions that closed in the second quarter, including Johnson &amp; Johnson's $19.7 billion acquisition of Synthes, Sara Lee's $7.2 billion spinoff of its international coffee and tea business and Austar United Communications' AUD $2.7 billion sale to Foxtel. We're also advisor on a number of significant announced transactions, including Cooper Industries' $12.6 billion sale to Eaton, Walgreens' purchase of a 45% stake in Alliance Boots for $6.7 billion and Catalyst Health Solutions' $4.4 billion sale to SXC Health Solutions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Second quarter underwriting net revenues were $734 million, up 10% sequentially. Equity underwriting revenues of $239 million were down 6% from the first quarter, reflecting weaker issuance activity. Debt underwriting increased 21% to $495 million, diverging from lower industry-wide issuance volumes due to our involvement in several significant transactions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">During the second quarter, we participated in many noteworthy underwriting transactions, including BTG Pactual's $1.7 billion IPO, IHS' $1 billion secondary offering and Chesapeake Energy's $4 billion bridge loan. Our Investment Banking backlog increased from the end of first quarter levels.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Let me now turn to Institutional Client Services, which is comprised of FICC and equities client execution, commissions and fees and securities services. Net revenues were $3.9 billion in the second quarter. Our FICC and equities client execution business produced significantly lower results relative to the first quarter, driven by macro concerns and weaker market sentiment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">FICC client execution net revenues were $2.2 billion in the second quarter, down 37% from the first quarter as most businesses produced lower results. Our rates, currencies, credit and commodities businesses were negatively impacted by client risk aversion and lower volumes following more acute concerns about the situation in Europe and broader macroeconomic weakness. While volumes were also lower in mortgages, the business benefited from better asset price stability.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Turning to equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees and securities services. Net revenues for the second quarter were $1.7 billion, down 25% sequentially. Equities client execution revenues were 51% lower to $510 million, reflecting higher levels of volatility and declining market volumes. Commissions and fees were $776 million, down 7% from the first quarter on lower volumes. Securities services net revenues of $409 million were 11% higher sequentially due to seasonally stronger client activity. Turning to risk, average daily value at risk in the second quarter was $92 million, down 3% relative to the first quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Let me now review Investing &amp; Lending, which produced net revenues of $203 million in the second quarter. The firm's Investing &amp; Lending activities across various asset classes, primarily including debt securities and loans and equity securities, are included in this segment. These activities include both direct investing and investing through funds as well as lending activities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Our investment in ICBC produced a loss of $194 million during the quarter. Other equity investments generated net losses of $112 million, reflecting losses in public equities largely offset by gains in private equities. Net revenues from debt securities and loans included net interest income and net gains of $222 million. Other revenues of $287 million were primarily driven by the firm's investment in consolidated investment entities. In Investment Management, we reported second quarter net revenues of $1.3 billion, up 13% from the first quarter, largely due to incentive fees related to the sale of our client's remaining investment in ICBC. Management and other fees were consistent with the first quarter at $1 billion. During the second quarter, assets under management increased $12 billion to $836 billion. Inflows and fixed income due to the acquisition of Dwight Asset Management were partially offset by $4 billion of market depreciation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior-year equity awards and other items, such as payroll taxes and benefits, was accrued at a compensation to net revenue ratio of 44%, which is consistent with the firm's accrual in the first quarter of 2012. Second quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.3 billion, 4% lower than the first quarter, reflecting reduced cost across a number of expense categories. Total staff at the end of the second quarter was approximately $32,300, relatively flat from the first quarter of 2012. Our year-to-date effective tax rate was 33.2%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Many of the last several quarters presented challenging operating conditions, with macroeconomic concerns taking center stage. As we've said many times, our opportunity set begins with a client's decision to transact, and the recent environment has damaged client sentiment and reduced overall activity levels. As a management team, we recognize that we cannot control the macro environment. However, we remain committed to using all the appropriate levers available to us to improve returns without negatively impacting our client franchise or longer-term prospects.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We have a long history of adapting, and we'll need to continue to allocate resources effectively to meet our clients' need to maximize returns. In a difficult operating environment, we have 2 principal levers to enhance returns: expense and capital management. A year ago, we announced a $1.2 billion expense initiative. We subsequently increased the amount to $1.4 billion. We've met that target and continue to focus on improving operating efficiencies across the firm. We're currently targeting approximately $500 million in additional run rate cost savings to be achieved by year end.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">During the quarter, we repurchased 14.3 million shares of common stock for a total cost of $1.5 billion. We believe that we have sufficient flexibility to manage our capital levels appropriately for the remainder of the year. However, the level of ongoing share repurchases will continue to be driven by our assessment of the risk to the broader operating environment, our earnings generation and the potential for more attractive opportunities to put our capital to work for clients.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In this environment, we will continue to focus on helping our clients navigate the challenging market conditions. We will work to balance near-term uncertainties with longer-term strategic goals. We will invest for growth in attractive regions and businesses and reduce our commitment to businesses experiencing lower client demand. Doing this effectively is the key to protecting our global client franchise and thus, our ability to generate attractive long-term returns for our shareholders.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">With that, I'd like to thank you again for listening today. And now, I'm happy to take your questions</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p4\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Howard Chen with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Just picking up where you left off the prepared comments, with all that you're willing and trying to do to control expenses and capital management, we still have a 5% return on tangible equity. Just curious what else is in your mind and the partners' minds about getting back to kind of exceeding cost of capital and other than just waiting for a more vibrant macro environment?</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Howard, look, I think you've heard me talk about this before. We're controlling the levers we can, which are expenses and capital. We obviously don't want to go too far on either one, because we think, at some point, the world will be -- will get better. But I think that all of those things will let us perform a little bit better in a tough environment. They're not -- we're not going to cut our way to prosperity, and we're not going to cut our way to the appropriate levels of returns. And I think that we'll continue to do the best we can with our clients, manage our expenses and manage our capital, but I would not expect that we're going to have acceptable ROEs in a macro environment like this.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Understood. And then given the recent Fed, 2.5 and Basel III NPRs, was just hoping you could give some thoughts on some of the Basel III guidance after you and the team incorporate some of these recent NPR rules.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Yes. What I would tell you is when we sit here today, best estimate, and these are still rough and all done manually, if we looked at Basel III today, it would be slightly below 8%. And if we roll forward, and only just pure math add consensus estimate and largely, the passive items like credit correlation, mortgage securitization, they're going to roll off, by the end of 2013, we'd get to slightly under 10%. And that's about 0.5% lower, because of -- than we told you last time, because of some of those -- the new Federals and about 0.5% lower because of lower consensus estimates that have come out. So those are 2 things that have really changed since we spoke last.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Great. And then finally for me, $1.5 billion of share repurchase is pretty impressive this quarter. I think if -- I know there's a lot of variables in this. But if the stock does the same trajectory as it did last year, i.e. it remains below tangible book, we saw you pick up share repurchase in the third quarter and then get a little quieter in the December quarter. Is that still a fair assumption to use? Or are there other things specific to this operating environment or valuation that we should be thinking about for this year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">I -- we can't give you a prediction. It's going to depend on a lot of things. And I -- again, you've heard me talk about this before. It's a very big dilemma in an environment like this. We -- in an environment like this, we are -- tend to be very cautious. We tend to conserve cash and conserve capital, and yet, we have a stock price trading well below tangible book. And I know when we look back in the future, we're going to wish we'd bought back more at this price. And so it's a trade-off between caution in a difficult environment, seeing what our earnings are and calibrating it with the very low stock price. And so it's not a science. And it's something that we look at all the time, and we'll just have to see as we go.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Nomura.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Is there anything you can tell us on the asset servicing sale on the capital freed up, potential gain, revenues impacted, anything you can help us with? Because I think I get the strategic rationale of not investing in core business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So there wasn't a lot of capital attributed to the business, so I don't think it's going to free up that much capital. We have very little book value. So a very large portion of the purchase price will be gain. I think the transaction's expected to close in the fourth quarter, so probably won't come till then. And there was not a lot of revenue and earnings associated with it, so it's not going to have -- it has a very immaterial effect on our business going forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Okay. Appreciate that. This might be nitpicky, but is it fair to assume that what you and others have -- well, let's just stick with you guys, what you bought back in the quarter was one quarter of your CCAR approval?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">I -- we have not disclosed that number nor am I going to start right now. But it was a good try, Glenn.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Can -- Alliance Boots, on the Advisory side, I could take my guesses. But can you help us of what you owned and what it contributed in the quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">With that, I'm not going to give you the exact numbers, but we had a very small, very small equity investment in it. And so -- and a slightly larger but still very small amount of debt. So the gains from those were not terribly material.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Okay. That's good. And then lastly, this is -- any color would be helpful. But you have the expense thing going on. You just told us about more \u2013 you have the buyback, which is actually reducing your share count. Can you talk about how you think about the potential operating leverage, God help us, if revenues actually do go up some day? Because it seems like the incremental margins are -- potential is big.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Look, we -- I think you said it well. We think we're very well set up, because the other thing you didn't mention was the amount of liquidity we have. And we have a lot of liquidity also, which can be used if we see good business opportunities. And so we think that we kind of have staffing levels at the right places and the right seniority. Our expense base about taking it down to where we think it ought to be, capital levels where they ought to be. And if we see good opportunities, obviously, we'll start generating capital again. Remember, in addition to that, our risk is extremely low. The VaR, while its just one measure of risk, $92 million is the lowest it's been since the third quarter of 2006. It's almost 6 years. So I think if we see the world get better, and my view on this, it will get better, I just don't know when. We're in a cyclical business. I think we're extremely well set up. And I guess the last thing I'd add to that is our client franchise. We continue to have a very high market share in all of the most important businesses. And I think if there's more to do, we'll get on more than our fair share of it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Last one that's related to that is you made your comments on Europe. You guys have been very defensive on it and right. Have you seen any signs that either the logjam or the ultimate solution is near?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Look, I'm not an economist, and I'm not an expert in this, but there's nothing that we've seen that -- you heard my comments -- that gives us a lot of confidence that there's a solution coming any day now. I hope I'm wrong there. And as I said, I'm not an expert in this. And I know there's a lot of people over there who are working very diligently to come up with the right solution, but we've been through this for a very long time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">A couple of cleanup questions on that. On the sale to STT, what's the impact on FTE?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">The impact on?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">FTEs? Headcount?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Betsy, I don't actually know that number offhand. So how about if we get back to you on that? I think it's going to be maybe a couple of hundred people, but I'm not 100% sure. So we'll come back to you on that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay. And then the $500 million in cost saves by year-end, does that include the STT sale?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">It's going to be pretty immaterial. It's really going to be a $500 million run rate savings on our kind of ongoing expenses. The expenses that we had associated with that were not very big. Both the revenues and the expenses were not very big.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">All right. Can you just -- can I dig in a little bit to where the opportunity set is for the expenses? Is it more coming from the non-comp line, where there's opportunities for you to leverage some of the investment spend you've been making in your IT backbone?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">I'd say it's actually more -- it's on the margin non-comp expenses and more people related, and it won't necessarily result in lower headcount. In fact, I would expect that with campus hiring coming on, we'll probably have higher headcount by the end of the year. But we'll have a more junior and less senior-weighted headcount going forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay. So more skewed towards comp than non-comp?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Yes. That's right.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay. And then just lastly, we've been getting closer to derivative proposals coming out of the CFTC. Can you just walk us through how you're thinking about shifting the business, if at all?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">I think you said it well. We're getting closer, but we're still not there. Even some of the things that have been agreed upon haven't been released yet. We're, I think, not saying wait and see, because we have a lot of people working on getting ready, but we're not really making wholesale changes yet until we know the final rules. But I think you're right. We're getting closer, but we're just not there yet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay. And then last, when you mentioned under 8% Basel III, that included the 2.5, right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">That's all in?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Yes, all in.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Your next question comes from the line of Kian Abouhossein with JPMorgan.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">A few questions. On NPR 2, I assume you're assuming in your 8% calculation, below 8%, a standard methodology for NPR 2 rather than an internal one. Is that correct?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Yes, that is correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">And is it likely that you will be able to move to an internal model, i.e. the 50 basis points could come back?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">We don't know yet. It's something we have to work through, and we'll work with the regulators. It'll take a little bit of time, but I'd be -- I don't want to overstate it. We just don't know.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">And can you give us an idea, the 283 market risk-weighted assets that you have disclosed in the past for 2011 and in one of your presentations, where would we be standing at this point for the 283?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Kian, I'm sorry. I don't have that number right at the tip of my fingers either. We'll come back to you on that one.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. No problem with that. And lastly, if we look at the risk rating of NPR 2 on the securitization, which will be about 20% on the highest tranche. If I look at Europe, we would be around 7% under CRD III. How do you see your business developing in such a context considering the European have an advantage on the securitization front going forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">You ask a very fair question there. I would tell you that some of the rules, even the ones you talked about, didn't come out as badly as we thought they might have, which would have made the divergence even greater. But I think we're looking at this, and we're just going to have to see how it unfolds. But I think it does put the U.S. firms at a competitive disadvantage. I think you're right. And it might end up with a smaller mortgage securitization business for us.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And if I may, one more. In terms of capital movement within the firm, how do you see the capital moving towards higher-growth areas? Where are the segments either by business where you see opportunities or geographies from your perspective?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Look, we've talked about a little bit about this before. We continue to be pretty optimistic about the growth markets. Obviously, they're not a straight line up, and some of them are experiencing some difficulties now. But over the next 3 to 5 years, we continue to think that there's going to be greater economic growth in some of the growth markets and some of the developed markets. But we're also pretty bullish as the world starts to get better, which I just don't know when it's going to happen in most of our businesses all around the world. And so we're -- you've heard Lloyd say, we want to be Goldman Sachs in more places, but we also want to grow Goldman Sachs where we are.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">I just wanted to follow up on the article I'm reading in the Wall Street Journal: Goldman builds private bank, sets a target for $100 billion in additional loans. Can you describe what you're doing in the private banking area and with regard to targets for loans?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Sure. I think there might have been some overstatement there. Look, we've been in the private wealth business for a long time. You know that's a very important business for Goldman Sachs. We've always lent to our private wealth clients. And having the bank has just made that a more efficient and more profitable business, so we intend to continue to grow that slowly as we have been. As far as corporate loans go, as we've mentioned, with -- especially with the retrenchment of some of the European banks, there are some of our clients who really need dollar funding. We have some available through the bank. We'll use it where we think it's most efficient, we have the most profit opportunities, we have the clients who need it most. So again, I think we're just going to be more efficient. And all I'd tell you is the bank -- the total bank has a little over $100 billion in assets and only about $50 billion in deposits, which are used for a variety of things. So you can do the math on the loans.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So do you have a $100-billion loan target?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">I would say we have $50 billion of deposits right now. They're going to grow slowly over time as we can grow them, and then we'll use some amount of that for our loans. So you can -- as I said, you can do the math.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So now, a real big picture question. In deciding to go this direction more aggressively, you could either decide to expand the balance sheet, expand loans, expand the back. You could have gone the other direction and said, \"We're going to de-bank and really shrink what we have, especially trading below tangible book.\" Or you could have just put off this decision to another day. So why decide this now? What was the urgency, in addition to the European bank situation? And did you consider the idea of de-banking or just dramatically shrinking your balance sheet?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Mike, I think I told you there might have been some overstatements, to start. I think that -- again, I've told you before that I think the idea of de-banking is not really something that's on our mind. We're regulated by the Fed. We're going to be regulated by the Fed. We are a bank holding company, and we're going to be one for the foreseeable future. So that hasn't changed, but I don't think there's any big change in our strategy that's coming. This is something that is part of what we are. We're going to grow it where we see opportunities, we're going to take advantage of the opportunities we see, but it's not a big change in strategy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And then lastly, you're still trading below tangible book value, and I know you have a lot of confidence that your assets are marked accurately. Anything else you can do to realize that value in addition to more aggressively repurchasing your stock?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I think that's really the main way.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Deutsche Bank.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Maybe a follow-up question just on the return environment. It seems like if you look across the industry, it's tough enough for someone like you or even the top 5 players in the industry to still generate a 10% ROE. So it's got to be, depending on mix, even tougher for firms that are kind of in the 5 to 15 ranking. Given that you're big on the Advisory side in the financial service sector, has there been any pickup in discussions, dialogue on bigger moves instead of just the cost-cutting strategic decisions in the industry of exiting certain businesses, paring down certain regions? Like are we at that point, just given that this weak macro environment has been kind of just slugging along for a few years?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Look, it's a really hard question as we've talked about. You never know what the future is going to bring. We're in a cyclical business. We know we're in a cyclical business. It's hard to know when the cycle's going to change. We think we have tremendous upside in a lot of our businesses. While we're trying to pare down and perform as well as we can in this difficult environment, it's not returns that are acceptable to us or to our shareholders, and we know that. But the question is how much of the upside that we want to give away to have slightly better performance today. So we're not at the point now where we're thinking of wholesale strategic changes or wholesale shrinkages in any way. We have a long history of doing this incrementally as we see how the world unfolds, and I think I would expect that that's what we're going to continue to do.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. I mean that was for you. I was saying more for the industry. Like meaning when you look across like the financial service sector, based on the conversations through, like on the Advisory side, have you seen a pickup on dialogues based on the environment and potential changes taking place?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Look, I think we've talked about seeing some of the European banks retrench as -- with some of the difficulty. But other than that, we're not really seeing wholesale changes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. And then on your cost reductions, just that $500 million, that makes sense, no wholesale changes. But in terms of where you're seeing those opportunities, like are you still overinvested in Asia or Europe and so you're pulling back more there? Is it certain product areas or certain businesses? Or is it across the board still?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">The only thing I would say is while we're -- because we still think it's a great long-term opportunity, we're certainly pulling back less in the growth markets than other places. But that doesn't mean that -- as we said, they're not a straight line up either, but we're pulling back less there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. And then last one, just on the OTC shift. It seems like we're getting closer in terms of the number of rules that are out there. But still, seems like it's going to get kicked to 2013. When you look at it, whether it's the clearing opportunity and then obviously, the give-up on some of the revenues, do you have any indication or any estimate of -- I think most would expect the OTC market can get cleared -- the challenge is what portion can trade on a SEF or can transact and then the pricing goes away or goes to those platforms? So when you look at the OTC market, what portion can go in that direction? And then even though pricing goes down there, how much capital can you be saving as a lot of these products get cleared?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Mike, it's really hard for me to give you specificity on that question. The rules aren't done yet. The industry is still looking at how these things are going to unfold. If I gave you specific numbers there, I would literally be making them up, and I don't want to do that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">A lot of my questions have been asked, but just maybe a couple quick ones. FICC results were actually a little bit better than we had been looking for. And in the press release at least, you highlighted the strength in the mortgage business, and you commented on asset price stability helping out there. Was there some benefit from Maiden Lane? Or can you give us a little more granular impact on what that was?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I think that's one of the things that helped. I think some of the Maiden Lane transactions being cleaned up, I think that took a little bit of overhang off the market. I think that was good. I think you probably saw there have been some tenders in Europe, which have been helpful. So there's been a lot of things that have taken some of the overhang off the market. And as investors have also been searching for yield, I think they felt pretty good about the mortgage space. And so I think it's been a pretty attractive space for people.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. And then circling back to the private bank question, and I know you've stated pretty clearly that the article overdid it a little bit. But when you think about some of the regulatory constraints that are being applied to the Capital Markets businesses and -- couldn't this potentially be an opportunity to create some more stability in your earnings base? And given, as you said, the great relationships you already have with many of your high net worth clients and such, the opportunity to maybe grow the bank to just give a bit more of a baseline for Goldman, is that something that you guys are thinking about as well or not really? Am I overdoing it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I don't want to -- I want to neither overstate nor understate the opportunity. I mean, as I said, private wealth business is a good business for us. We have a bank. We are a bank, a bank holding company with a bank. We're raising deposits, and we'll use some of those deposits for private individual loans, some of it for corporate loans. But we're not a retail bank. We don't have branches. We're not going to bring in $1 trillion of deposits, and so there is no change in the strategy of Goldman Sachs. We're largely a wholesale firm. We also have a bank, and we'll use those deposits that we have and grow them and use them wisely for profitable opportunities where we see them.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Wheeler with Mediobanca.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Christopher Wheeler - Mediobanca Securities, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">A couple of questions on the Investment Management business, if I may. First, just a point of clarification. In terms of the incentive fees in respect of ICBC, is it fair to say that probably, if we split those out, we'd have the normal kind of seasonal double-digit millions of incentive fees? That's the first question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Christopher Wheeler - Mediobanca Securities, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. The second one is falling back on the private banking segment, can you give us some clue as to the portion of the $839 billion of AUM that at the moment you would classify as being with wealthy individuals as opposed to being institutional or retail?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Chris, again, I don't have those numbers with me. And so we're going to have to come back to you on that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Christopher Wheeler - Mediobanca Securities, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. And then really following on from that, in terms of -- I'm sorry to push on the strategy, but it is a very topical issue, particularly given obviously what seems to be a desire to diversify here. But would the focus, you would say, remain on your traditional U.S. client base, or would you focus perhaps a little bit more of your effort on, obviously, what is the faster-growing Asian markets, where obviously, you have a strong footprint in the investment bank?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Well, we've talked about this before. Growing the private wealth business outside the United States has been a big focus of ours and especially in some of the growth markets, as you mentioned, like Asia, where we think there is a lot of wealth that's been and being created given our investment banking relations and given the strength in our private wealth business. That has been a strategic focus of ours for a while, and it continues to be.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Christopher Wheeler - Mediobanca Securities, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. And then if I was to ask you, what portion of your -- I suppose you've answered the question. But your portion of your wealth management assets are actually outside of the United States, would you have an idea whether it was 20%, 10%?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">It's very small right now. It's a very small number, but it's something that we're looking to grow rapidly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question comes from the line of Roger Freeman with Barclays.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I'm just going to come back to a couple of things that have been asked already. One, on the buybacks, were you fairly spaced across the quarter? Or were the buybacks more concentrated earlier part than latter part given the gyrations in the markets?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I think it was -- I mean, you can see by the average, I think we were relatively evenly spaced across the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. So I mean as you balance all those things that you've talked about and the risk environment, as you characterize it, it appears not as -- certainly, not as bad as parts of the fourth quarter last year, where I think you did pull back on the buyback. Is that a fair characterization?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I \u2013 look, as I said before, this is something that we're going to consider as we go forward. I don't think you should take the fourth quarter as an example of anything other than it's what we decided to in the fourth quarter of last year. And we're just going to see how things unfold as we go forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. Then on the $500 million in additional run rate costs you're going to take out, does that assume a current-ish run rate for the balance of the year?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I'm not sure I understood that question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Well, does it -- is it an assessment of where you need to get your cost base to relative to current levels of revenue generation?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes. It's assuming things are kind of stable as they are, we expect that by the end of the year, we will have taken out round numbers and other $500 million of cost. It will come out over the next couple of quarters.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. And is there anything that you or the board, management will be looking to make a determination otherwise? In other words, if there's a bigger structural cost change that would after -- be given of you that the revenue profile is going to be challenged for a long period of time? I know that's not your view right now.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Look, that's always the hard question, and it's always hard. I can't tell you we won't reach that conclusion. It's hard to reach that conclusion. History tells us that we will do things more on an incremental basis. But we'll have to see how the world unfolds.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes, okay. And then just 2 more quick ones. Investing &amp; Lending, you talked about some Private Equity gains. I guess within that, how much was realized versus unrealized? And was most of the realized the Alliance Boots that Doug was asking about?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Well, the second question is easy. Most was not the Alliance Boot. It was a pretty small number, as I said. I don't have what was realized versus unrealized with me, but most of it is what we would call event driven, which means it was based on a company that was private, went public. So then we're able to see the price, a bid for a company that we have an investment in. So it was mostly event driven.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. That's fair. And then lastly, just on securities services, you mentioned revenues were up sequentially. Were balance, prime brokerage balances up?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">They were roughly flat.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question comes from the line of Brad Hintz with Bernstein.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Brad Hintz - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes. Right. I've been looking at the British Banker's Association site, and your name doesn't appear on the list as a LIBOR bank. But I guess I have a question, that is as a major player in fixed income, over the counter enlisted derivatives and as a major money market provider, would that make Goldman Sachs an aggrieved market participant if LIBOR was manipulated?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Let's just say we're not a provider of LIBOR. And we'll just leave it at that, Brad.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Brad Hintz - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. Well, then I -- can we talk about history though?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Sure.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Brad Hintz - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">In the 1990s, Salomon attempted to manipulate the U.S. Treasury auction. And there was a series of civil claims against Salomon by the other primary dealers. Was Goldman a plaintiff?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I actually do not know. I don't believe so, but I don't remember. I'd have to go back and look. I think in this one, we're going to watch this for a while.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Brad Hintz - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Well, okay. So no comments on LIBOR at this point?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Other than that we're not involved.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question comes from the line of Fiona Swaffield with Royal Bank of Canada.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Fiona Swaffield - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Just 2 small things. Just a little bit more clarification on the Basel III. You mentioned '11 now being closer to '10 for 2013. I just wanted to check if that excludes any additional mitigation and whether you've -- now you've got more sight of the rules, whether you may kind of up the mitigation or give us some details on that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">It excludes active mitigation. As I said, there's some stuff that just rolls off. That's included in there. It largely includes any active mitigation, and it's something that we're really starting to go through with the businesses now. So I don't have a better update for you on it, but we're going to start looking at it pretty closely.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Fiona Swaffield - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. And just a clarification on Investment Management. I mean, you obviously mentioned the impact of the acquisition on the net new assets, but would it have any impact on the absolute revenues, Q2 on Q1?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Very, very minor.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Harte with Sandler O'Neill.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Jeffrey Harte - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Couple of I think kind of cleanup ones. On the expense side, it seems most quarters recently, we've had the impairment charges related to consolidated investment entities running through the D&amp;A line. I don't know, it's been something in the neighborhood of $100 million a quarter. How should we think of that going forward? Because to the extent that that continues, that would be potentially a meaningful part of the $500 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">It's not what we were thinking of in the $500 million, but we certainly hope that those diminish over time. We like our investments to be good investments, and obviously, the ones that are impaired are not. And we think we're through a lot of it, but I can't tell you the other things aren't going to go the wrong way.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Jeffrey Harte - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Is that something we should look at market trends and almost like a Private Equity-type we should mark things up or down? Or is it just...</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">No. It tends to be very idiosyncratic, and it tends to be more based on the performance of an investment rather than the market.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Jeffrey Harte - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. And you mentioned earlier Europe, and we've heard a lot -- at least we were hearing a lot of about market share gains in different businesses as European competitors have pulled back. As we come into the summer and the environment really hasn't been a whole lot better, I guess, a, are you still seeing that? Is it spreading at all? And b, how meaningful of an opportunity really can that be for Goldman Sachs?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Look, you've heard me say this. We think that it is an opportunity. We think that there's going to be needs in Europe and that the banks are retrenching. But so far, the -- there hasn't been that much activity, and so it's really hard to see it come through. We think that over time that would be a really -- and certainly, over the near term, it could be a meaningful opportunity for us, but we haven't seen it yet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Jeffrey Harte - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. And was there -- I guess finally, was there any DVA gains to note on the quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Less than $10 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Worgen [ph] with JPMorgan.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Unknown Analyst</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I'm still struggling a little bit with the comp issue. I mean, I think we've had this discussion, but it's becoming more material now. I mean, basically, under the Basel rules, the capital that you have to have today more than has doubled. And I recognize we're kind of in a cyclically slow environment. But in the past, you guys said, \"Well, look, relative to the peer group, our ROT is better.\" So it justified like the comp ratio you were producing. But now, your return on tangible equity is kind of in line or even below some of the peer group, and you're still comping at like 44%. Now I recognize in the fourth quarter, you tend to true that up so that the aggregate full year number tends to go in the lower 40s. But I mean, at what point do you just recognize like that the business has changed because of the capital or maybe the revenue environment and that the new structural or normal comp ratio should be something materially lower, like maybe in the 30s, so shareholders get appropriate return above their cost of capital?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Look, first of all, I think it's a dangerous thing to compare comp ratios, because you have a lot of very, very differently structured firms. So I don't think you can compare comp ratio amongst firms. I think we're doing -- we're very cognizant of the returns that our shareholders get versus what our employees get. As you know, the ratio itself has come down pretty meaningfully in the last several years. We'll see what it ends up being this year. We also live in a competitive environment. And we could cut comp very dramatically in one year, and it would help our returns. But we live in a competitive environment. We still have people leaving for multiyear offers away from us, some from our competitors, some from other industry participants. And so we try and balance those 2 things as best we can.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question comes from the line of Douglas Sipkin with Susquehanna.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Just 2 questions. One, you mentioned the IB pipeline had improved a little bit. Can you talk about maybe where you were seeing that? And then just a follow-up. It just seems like on the margin, you're starting to see a little bit more M&amp;A activity, obviously, very gradual. Maybe you can comment on if something's happening. Or is it sort of just guys saying, \"All right. This is the environment, and we still want to do something.\"</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So the covenants, first of all, you've heard me talk before about it, backlog was up. It's an indication. You shouldn't read too much into it. As you know, some deals never get into backlog. Some deals that are in backlog don't get done. But I think it is an indication that we saw a little bit more activity in the first quarter, and it was, I'd say more M&amp;A and debt focused than equity focused given how tough the equity markets were. And you're right, we're seeing a small pickup in M&amp;A volumes. We continue to see a very large number of discussions. I think some of that pickup are cross-border deals, where people think that they can pick up assets cheap in various locations. But I think we're -- it's still a question of CEOs becoming more confident before we see a very big pickup in the merger business, which is at historic lows. And so I think we're poised for that to happen, but it's not going to happen until CEOs become more confident.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">First of all, on the I&amp;L Portfolio, given now that we -- you've seen the text of the NPR, are you thinking of any changes to the overall balances within that portfolio from what you've already read in the NPR? And are you thinking about potentially changing the amount of capital supporting that business?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">There are some things that are just proposals, and we're still going through them and trying to understand exactly how to interpret them, because they're not so clear. But as of now, we're not thinking necessarily of a change in strategy, but we're going to have to look at what the capital requirements are. And we're going to have to make sure that investments we make will have the appropriate returns given the capital requirements that we have. If they don't, we won't make them.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And then forgive me if you've already mentioned this, but I jumped on the call just a couple minutes late. Any material changes to your stated exposures to the GIIPS countries in the second quarter relative to what you've put out for the first quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">No. They're up a little bit up, but they're still our gross exposure which, as you know, is exposure only net of cash in U.S. Treasury collateral. But before any hedges, it's still under $4 billion. And that after you take into account CDS hedging, which are with banks outside of the country, is roughly $2.5 billion. So about as well as it can be and still be operating in those countries.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And then I guess within that, just one additional question on the commercial/high net worth business. Would there be loans that would be made in that business that would be included in the -- in future GIIPS exposures potentially? Or is it more focused on Asia?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yes. No, it would be there too. If we have clients in those areas, if we can structure them well and have the right protections, maybe with collateral outside the GIIPS area, maybe with collateral with very big haircuts, we would certainly use the dollar funding capacity that we have possibly, because we have a lot of important clients in those regions for loans in those regions as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">And at this time, there are no further questions. I will now turn the call over to management for any closing remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Dane Holmes</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">We'd like to thank everyone for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. If anybody has any additional questions, please feel free to reach out to us in the Investor Relations department. Otherwise, enjoy the rest of your day.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Ladies and gentlemen, this now concludes the Goldman Sachs Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call.

My name is Dennis, and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">[Audio Gap]</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">call is being recorded today, Tuesday, October 16, 2012. Thank you. Mr. Holmes, you may begin your conference.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Dane Holmes</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Director of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm's belief regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain and outside of the firm's control. The firm's actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our current annual report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended December 2011.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets and Global Core Excess. And you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that is posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">This audiocast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Our Chief Financial Officer, David Viniar, will now review the firm's results with Harvey Schwartz who will assume David's role at the end of January. David?</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thanks, Dane. I'd like to thank all of you for listening today. I'll give an overview of our third quarter results and Harvey will review our business performance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Net revenues were $8.4 billion and net earnings were $1.5 billion. Earnings per diluted share were $2.85 and our annualized return on common equity was 8.6%. Year-to-date, our annualized return on common equity was 8.8%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">The third quarter operating environment included continuing concerns about the outlook for the global economy, particularly as it relates to the situation in Europe. The uncertainty surrounding economic prospects has weighed on the psychology of corporate leaders and investors, negatively impacting the current operating environment in 2 principal ways.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Corporate client activity continued to be relatively weak in the third quarter. Industrywide, announced M&amp;A volumes declined 16% sequentially and IPO volumes were nearly cut in half. In addition, New York Stock Exchange volumes were down 13% sequentially, while LSC volumes were down 23%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">An additional impact of economic uncertainty and weak investor conviction is the tendency for investors to transact in the most liquid and commoditized portion of the market. This dynamic is evident within both the FICC and equities franchises, as demonstrated by the significance of index product volumes in credit and equities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Although client activity remains muted, there were some favorable developments during the third quarter. The United States Federal Reserve announced a further increase in monetary stimulus, and the ECB stated that it would support the euro and was prepared to make outright purchases in the secondary bond market to address severe distortion in government bond markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Since the ECB's pronouncements, Spain and Italy's 5-year CDS spreads have each tightened by over 200 basis points, reflecting the market's diminished view that a tail event will emanate out of Europe. While these positive developments have created some optimism in the marketplace, we as a management team remained focused on guiding the firm through a continued difficult operating environment. We are serving our leading client franchise, managing our risk profile prudently and being disciplined about capital usage and operating expenses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Harvey will now review each of our businesses. Harvey?</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Thanks, David.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Investment Banking produced third quarter net revenues of $1.2 billion, down 3% from second quarter results. Third quarter advisory revenues were $509 million, up 9% from the second quarter. Year-to-date, Goldman Sachs ranked first in announced and completed M&amp;A globally. We advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the third quarter, including Amylin Pharmaceuticals' $7 billion sale to Bristol-Myers Squibb; NDS group's $5 billion sale to Cisco; and CGI Group's $3.2 billion acquisition of Logica. We also advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the third quarter, including Nexen's $19 billion sale to CNOOC; Amerigroup's $4.9 billion sale to WellPoint; and Fraser &amp; Neave's $4.5 billion sale, with interest in Asia Pacific Breweries, to Heineken.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Third quarter underwriting net revenues were $655 million, down 11% sequentially. Equity underwriting revenues of $189 million were down 21% from the second quarter, reflecting weaker IPO activity. Year-to-date, Goldman Sachs was ranked first in global equity and equity-related and common stock offerings. Debt underwriting revenues decreased 6% to $466 million.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">During the quarter, we participated in many noteworthy underwriting transactions, including Whole Logic's $3.5 billion combination term loan and high-yield notes offering; Dollar General's $2.1 billion follow-on offering; and Seadrill's $1 billion high-yield note offering. Our Investment Banking backlog decreased slightly from the end of the second quarter levels but remains higher than the end of 2011.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Let me now turn to Institutional Client Services which is comprised of FICC and equities client execution, commissions and fees, as well as security services. Net revenues were $4.2 billion in the third quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">FICC Client Execution net revenues were $2.2 billion in the third quarter and included a DVA loss of $225 million. Excluding the impact of DVA, revenues were up 11% sequentially. Our rates business benefited from improved client risk appetite related to central bank activity during the quarter. Mortgages was aided by improving housing fundamentals and strong customer demand. Credit results reflected solid client activity levels. Commodities and currencies were both negatively impacted by continued low levels of volatility and volumes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Turning to Equities which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees and securities services. Net revenues for the third quarter were $2 billion and included $145 million in DVA losses. Excluding the impact of DVA, revenues were up 26% sequentially.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Equities client execution revenues increased 66% sequentially to $847 million, reflecting a more benign market-making environment. Commissions and fees were $721 million, down 7% from second quarter on lower volumes. Securities services net revenues of $392 million were down 4% from the seasonally stronger second quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to risk. Average daily value at risk in the third quarter was $81 million, down 12% relative to the second quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Let me now review Investing &amp; Lending, which produced net revenues of $1.8 billion in the third quarter. Our investment in ICBC produced a gain of $99 million in the quarter. Other equity investments generated net revenues of $824 million, reflecting gains that were primarily driven by private equity investments. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $558 million, largely driven by a more favorable credit market, with tightening credit spreads and interest income. Other revenues of $323 million were primarily driven by the firm's investment in consolidated investment entities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Switching to Investment Management. We reported third quarter net revenues of $1.2 billion, down 10% sequentially as the firm booked onetime incentive fees related to the sale of our client's remaining investment in ICBC in the second quarter. Management and other fees were consistent with the second quarter at $1 billion. During the third quarter, assets under management increased $20 billion to $856 billion due to market appreciation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Now moving on to our expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as payroll taxes and benefits, was accrued at a compensation-to-net revenues ratio of 44%. This is consistent with the firm's accrual for the first half of 2012.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Third quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.4 billion. We continue to be focused on our cost-saving initiatives, and year-to-date, our non-compensation expenses are running 10% lower than the first 3 quarters of 2011.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Total staff at the end of the third quarter was approximately 32,600, relatively flat with the second quarter of 2012.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Our year-to-date effective tax rate was 33.5%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">During the quarter, we repurchased 11.8 million shares of common stock for a total cost of $1.25 billion. Today, we also announced an increase in our quarterly common stock dividend from $0.46 to $0.50 per share.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Now let me turn it back to David to make some concluding remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Thanks, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">As a management team, we are keenly aware of the fact that we cannot control the broader economic environment in which we operate. As we've said many times in the past, the firm will perform at its best and our shareholders will benefit to the greatest degree when we're in a more robust economic environment. However, a difficult operating environment does not absolve us from our responsibility to manage everything that is within our control to create best-in-class returns over the long term.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">We must be disciplined in managing both our operating expenses and capital levels. As it relates to operating expenses, we have to balance lowering costs and maintaining high levels of client service. In the second quarter of 2011, we announced a $1.2 billion expense reduction initiative. Since that initial announcement, we've increased the target expense savings by nearly 60% to $1.9 billion. We believe that we've been able to undertake these initiatives without materially impacting our client franchise. And as a consequence, we should be well positioned to create operating leverage in an improved economic environment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Regarding capital management, we've been extremely focused on balancing the competing objectives of returning excess capital to shareholders with the prudence associated with maintaining conservative risk-adjusted capitalization in a difficult operating environment with undefined capital rules. Since the onset of the financial crisis, our risk-based capital measures have remained at or near the top of the industry. While Basel III capital rules are not finalized and will not be fully phased-in for many years, our best estimate from what we know today is that, at the end of the third quarter, our Basel III Tier 1 common ratio would be approximately 8.5%. We expect that we will ultimately operate with a capital cushion in the proximity of 100 basis points versus our regulatory requirement.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We've remained committed to maintaining a conservative financial profile and have a deep appreciation for the strategic benefits, both opportunistically and defensively, that come with maintaining robust capital levels. While not wavering from that view, we've been able to repurchase $9.1 billion of common stock since the beginning of 2011 and have reduced our basic share count by 11%. As Basel III rules have started to be finalized and we are closer to implementation, we've begun to focus on optimizing our balance sheet in preparation for these changes. We've previously announced that we expected $88 billion of risk-weighted assets to passively roll off by 2015, and we have begun to roll out the necessary tools to facilitate a more active approach to mitigating risk-weighted assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We're committed to managing our operations, with a focus on serving our clients effectively. As a result, we manage our expenses and capital, with the understanding that our shareholders have invested in this franchise, with the expectation that we will outperform over the long term.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">With that, we'd like to thank you again for listening today. And now, Harvey and I are happy to take your questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p4\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">The first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Nomura.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">So I -- you noted the 11% share count reduction since the end of '11. I just want to ask maybe semantics on the quarter. Share count was down almost 2% in the quarter, but it's only down about 2% year-to-date. Is that a function of the stock going back up and just that fully diluted options count?</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">I think it -- that's partially what's in it. And the way diluted and basic share count work is a little bit different, Glenn, as I think you know. Basic is a point in time, diluted is an average over the period. So you -- and diluted is what we use for EPS, basic is used for book value per share. So you just have to be a little careful when you're comparing those numbers. And we're happy to get you the breakdown of all of them, if you like.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">That -- no problem. I'm -- the question is more of, you've been buying back at a nice pace and it's made a good dent in the share counts over the course of the last 2 years. You just saw less of it. And I know I'm doing apples and orange. I'm asking specifically in the quarter, I would have thought the fully diluted share count might have been down more year-to-date, and I just don't know if that's just a function of more shares going into the fully diluted count just because of improvement in the shares.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Why don't we do the calculation and we'll come back to it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">No worries. On Investing &amp; Lending, anything you can tell us on realized versus unrealized because I heard your comments about private equity on the equity line, but just curious on what's realized versus unrealized.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">I don't have the exact numbers. There was more unrealized than realized. Many of the private was unrealized. And we told you it was primarily -- although a lot of that -- part of that was based on performance, part of that was based on the markets and part of that was based on events happening even within private companies, but it was more unrealized than realized.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Okay. And then on the $1.9 billion, I mean, to me this is maybe a little more art than not, but how much of that is actually been able to make its way to the P&amp;L yet? Because a lot of this comes through headcount-related items that kind of linger as that phases through. So what is still on the COM [ph] on that $1.9 billion into the P&amp;L?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Most of that has been realized or, if not, will be realized by the end of the year. Virtually all of it will be realized by the end of the year. Now remember, part of that is non-comp, part of that has to do with people. And it's not -- and that -- it doesn't include reducing compensation, right? It would only be reduction of the compensation of people who are no longer here. But all of that either has been or will be realized by the end of this year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Your next question comes from the line of Roger Freeman with Barclays.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Just -- I guess, on -- your liquidity levels are still running kind of right up around record levels. And just thinking through the still-cautious approach to managing balance sheet, capital, it feels -- is this level something that over time comes down meaningfully or we going to see as the sort of permanently higher level of liquidity? I assume -- I mean, I assume this is a peak level, but at -- what kind of range relative to where you used to run, which I think was like 1/4 or 1/2 of this, do you think it may eventually get back to?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Well, this is Harvey, Roger. So what I'll say is, if you think about the current environment, well, David, in our opening remarks, highlighted the fact that there's certainly been some positive events globally. It's still a market environment where we're remaining pretty defensive. So I think it'd be really difficult to give you a sense of how the forward liquidity profile would look. But I think you should assume that we'll stay conservative for the time being, certainly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Okay. And then just your -- you said, I think, you'd anticipate running, on a Basel III capital ratio basis, your Tier 1 common at 100 basis points or so, a sort of buffer to your requirement. Is that to -- should we assume that you kind of build to that buffer and in the meantime kind of remain at your -- I guess, your pattern of not buying in excess of the net income before you were to do anything more meaningful, if you chose to do that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Look I think it's a fair assumption that we will build to that buffer. Remember, the full Basel III requirements are not in until 2019 so there's a long time till those requirements are in. Now it's not to say we're not going to get there till then. I'm sure we'll get there well before that. But yes, I think it's fair to assume that we will build to that buffer, and I think it's also fair to assume -- you can't look at any quarter, or even any year, but over time, it's not likely that we're going to buy back more than our net income. That would -- that's not a prudent way and you can't really operate on that basis. In any quarter, we might. In any year, we might. But over time, we're not going to.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Okay. And then on the -- still staying with the private equity portfolio: Where do you think you are in terms of wanting to monetize a lot of that? Because it's probably pretty seasoned at this point. And obviously, other private equity firms are trying to, where they can. Should we see -- expect to see that pick up?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">I -- we will monetize as opportunities arise. I don't think -- we're not in a mode of forcing monetization before it makes sense, but when opportunities arise and we think there's good transaction that can be done, then we'll monetize them.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Okay. And lastly, maybe Harvey, the Equities business had a nice sequential comparison. I suspect a lot of that was equity derivatives. Can you talk a little bit to how sort of broad-based that was or if that was -- if it's pretty sort of chunky-structured equity derivatives? Any color there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">There was -- it was a more benign environment for trading in terms of risk management. So that was certainly prevalent in the numbers, but overall, it was really broad-based performance. And we really benefited from the global footprint and diversification of the businesses from brokers all the way through execution.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Your next question comes from the line of Howard Chen with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">David, Harvey, just on the risk-weighted asset mitigation. David, if I look at the backdrop, on one hand, there appears to be a really strong bid for credit, mortgage. Other things will be higher rated. And then on the other hand, we're seeing some clarity to Basel 2.5 and III rules coming into focus. So I was just hoping you could comment on the environment and maybe your appetite to perhaps accelerate risk-weighted asset optimization or other opportunities, maybe dispose of them, given those 2 dynamics, if you agree with them.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">I think the real answer, Howard, is we're just going to have to see over time. As I said, we're just beginning to roll out the tools to do it. In the quarter that we've really just started, our Basel III ratio, again as best as we can calculate it, there's still a lot of assumptions, up by 0.5%. And I'm not saying that's going to happen every quarter. But I think, when we give our traders the tools to optimize and figure out what securities or what derivatives are better to hold, what things are better to hedge with, some things that don't make sense they will sell, some things they will keep and just keep in different forms, I think we'll probably start making some substantial progress.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay, great. And then a follow-up on the revised Basel III guidance -- that's very helpful. Just 2 follow-up questions. Does the 8.5% and the 100 bps buffer, does that incorporate the G-SED [ph] buffer? And then how does internal model approval factor into that guidance?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Well, the 8.5% is where we are approximately today and the 100 basis points buffer will be from whatever our full requirement is which, as you know, we don't know yet. But whatever that is -- yes, and again, don't hold me to it. It's not going to be exactly 100 basis points. It will be in that range and it will bounce up a little higher and a little lower and -- but that's around where we're going to run.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay, great. And then I just wanted to revisit this one last time. Just if we look at this quarter's results, the firm remains in that \"liquidity high, risk low\" type of profile. I mean the pressure around the central bank actions, the progress in Europe that you noted, David. Is there -- was there any change in that outlook as you exited the quarter? And if not, what are you specifically looking for to make that call to maybe rebalance and remix a little bit between the liquidity and the risk?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So first thing, most important thing, is what our clients do. And so again, there's -- as our clients get more active, we will have more opportunities to take risk, and we probably will to some extent. But there's still -- the -- while activity might have picked up a little bit towards the end of the quarter, it was certainly not a very, very large increase at all. And second of all, the traders themselves have to be more comfortable that the market environments are being driven by economics, as opposed to by politics, and I think maybe you've had a slight shift to that but not a big shift at all. So I think those are the things to really look for.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Your next question is from the line of Kian Abouhossein with JPMorgan.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">I -- on your Tier 1 guidance of 2013, you said 10%. Now you're running at 8.5% at the moment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Just wondering if there's any change to that 10%. And second question on capital in that respect is regarding the $89 billion (sic) [$88 billion] of runoff that you've indicated between 2011 to 2013 in one of the presentations earlier this year. Was wondering if you could give us an update of how much of the $89 billion (sic) [$88 billion] you've done. And how would this $89 billion (sic) [$88 billion] look like, including additional active mitigation?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. So let me just clarify, Kian: What we said for the end of 2013 was not that we were going to run at 10%. This is just pure math. We said, if you take where we are now, if you assume the consensus estimates for us and you assume just the passive roll-off of assets, so no active mitigation, that would get us to 10% with nothing else: no buybacks, no equity issuance through comp. So just pure math, that gets you to 10%. So that's what the 10% number is, I just want to clarify. And as far as the roll-off, again, that $88 billion is through 2015. That's what all the roll-off would be through 2015 and that was largely from basically 6 securitized assets from tranche credit in the correlation book and the mortgage book. So again, that's just to clarify what those numbers were. As far as the active mitigation, we're going to have to see. I mean, that's -- it's hard to put a number on that. As I said to the last question, we've just started to roll out the tools for that. We made a lot of progress in one quarter, and we'll see. History tells us that we do a pretty good job of optimizing these positions as the rules get more clarified and as our traders have the right tools, but we'll see over time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. And in terms of internal models, are your internal models all at approval stages? Or are there still outstanding internal models for your calculation? Are you giving us a number including internal models that you assume will be approved or -- by the Fed, or is that excluded and that could be on top? And if it's on top, how much would that be in terms of risk-weighted asset decline?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Again, it's very hard, very hard to calculate. There are some models that have been approved, there are others that are in process and there are many more that we will then go to the Fed. And as they get approved, if they get approved, then it will help the ratios. And if they don't, then we'll have to do more mitigation. And we'll just have to see over time with what, as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">What's your thought on CoCos, on top of the regulatory requirement and the 100 basis points? Do you think you need CoCos or you will participate in CoCos?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Those are not included in any of the numbers that I gave you. And again, we'll have to see what regulations are and what's allowed and what's not allowed, and then we'll make our decisions at the time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. Lastly, investments. Where do you see investment opportunities in terms of staff numbers and in terms of capital?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Well, look, we've said this before. In the -- certainly, in the medium term, we think that there are -- although it will be far from a straight line up, we think that the growth markets continue to provide very good medium- to long-term opportunities for the firm. As you know, we do best where there is good growth, where there's good economic growth. It is pretty clear that there's going to be better economic growth in some of the growth markets than in some of the developed markets, and so those are places where we will continue invest. It's not going to be a straight line up. That's not to say we're not going to invest in the developed markets as well. The U.S. market, the European markets where we think, despite some of the economic issues, there are very good near-term opportunities for our business are places that we will invest as the markets get better over time. But certainly, over the longer period of time, I'd say the growth markets probably will have more investment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">A couple of questions, one on the equity line. I'm just wondering, how much did Knight contribute to the line this quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So as I said before, the equity line in the business was quite diversified. As reported in the press, we did execute the Knight transaction and we were quite pleased to be able to work with Knight to help them manage that risk profile. But at this stage, we won't speak specifically about that transaction or any other transactions as it relates to its contribution to the line.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. And then your equity VaR efficiency obviously went up significantly in the quarter, right, since -- given the revenues. And then the equity VaR was down Q-on-Q. So should we -- you're kind of suggesting that, that level of VaR efficiency should persist into the future. Is that a fair takeaway?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">That is a very hard question to answer. We -- I bet you, if you looked at our revenue-to-VaR, it was different every quarter since we've been a public company. So I -- so it can be very hard for me to say it's going to continue at that level. Clearly, it was a better environment, that's why we said it's more broad-based, but there will be quarters when it will be better and some where it won't.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. And then on the -- just one more question on the Basel III. So you indicated that you were -- 8.5% has some model approval in it, and if the regulators have not approved your models, then that is not embedded within the 8.5%. Is that an accurate representation of what you said?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yes. That is largely accurate, yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And the CRM model approval, is that -- has that been approved or...</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Betsy, how about, if you want a lot of details about this, we get back to you and go through it with you?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yes, fine. And then just lastly on the share count. The Buffett-related warrants came back into the share count this quarter, isn't that right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">To some extent, yes. That -- again, that goes with share price. The way that works is, as the share price goes up and gets closer to $115 and, obviously, above $115, they start to come in and then they continue to come in more as the share price goes up.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I know David, you've often said, \"Live to fight another day,\" over the past year or so. And I noticed that your VaR went down from $92 million to $81 million, link quarter. So -- and Harvey, if you have anything to share on this too -- are you still conducting with an attitude \"Live to fight another day?\" Is reduction in VaR evidence of that, or is reduction of VaR evidence of simply lower volatility? And when are you willing to take on more risk?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So I'll answer, Mike. I mean, the answer to both those questions are yes and yes and yes -- I guess, to all 3 of them. There was somewhat-lower volatility that contributed as well. But I think that, really, it's back to what I said before: Our clients are not that active and so there aren't that many opportunities. And as far as the people on the frontline too aren't actually taking the risk, there's still so much political uncertainty out there that's driving markets. A speech by politician x or politician y drives markets up or down as much as any economic situation. And in that environment, it's very hard to have conviction and very hard to take risk both for our clients and for us. And I think, until you see that change a little bit, you won't really see our risk go up dramatically.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">If you were to neutralize the effect of lower volatility, would your VaR have gone down or would it have been flat?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I believe it still would have gone down somewhat. And I can come back to you with the exact amount.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">But just, conceptually, you pulled back risk even more than you had last quarter. Did anything get incrementally worse that caused you to do that, then?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">No. As David said, what really drives risk-taking in the franchised businesses is the client activity. And if you think back to the beginning of the quarter, there was still a fair bit of uncertainty that clients were dealing with and, even now, the discussions around fiscal cliff and everything else. This is a difficult environment for clients because they're very happy to transact and execute on fundamentals, but positioning their own capital against a backdrop of high policy risk creates a conservative environment. So there's certainly no specific efforts to drive down risk-taking, it's really a reflection of the volumes and client appetite, as David said.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And then lastly, so far this quarter, client activity, you've mentioned, started last quarter, pulling back risk. Are you maybe thinking of taking more risk? Or are flows better now than they were for last quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I think it's too early to really extrapolate much from the first couple of weeks. But as we've seen in the U.S., equity volumes have been down a touch, and we'll just have to see how the quarter progresses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So far, it's largely been more of the same.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">[Technical Difficulty]</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">small, but it was the second one this year, so...</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Brennan, we missed the beginning of what you said, so maybe you could start over?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So I know that dividend increase was small, but it was the second increase this year. So I guess I was just curious whether or not that was part of the CCAR plan initially. Or was it a choice to shift a small amount of money from buybacks to the dividend? And if that's any kind of indication of anything...</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">No, it was consistent with our CCAR approval. And again, while it was small, it was -- we've gotten feedback from our shareholders that they would like it, but I think you should expect, going forward, that much more of our capital planning will be around buybacks. Not to say we won't increase dividends again, but the big portion of our capital planning will be around buybacks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay, okay, great. Also, is there any way -- or could you give us any updated way to think about core or recurring revenue within the I&amp;L line? I know it's tricky, but any color you could give there might be helpful.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">It's very hard to do. It is somewhat driven by markets, by credit spreads, also by the performance of our specific investments matters. So I think that one is very, very hard to predict, going forward. If I gave you a number, I would really be making it up.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">The way I would think about it is, as a result of the Business Standards Committee, when we reframed the financials, it was really an effort on our part to give you more transparency.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Sure. I was just trying to think of whether or not there's -- there were a certain amount of income that kicks off from the dividends and yield and such that you could think about as sort of a baseline number.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">There's a few hundred million dollars of interest income that's in there, and something like that will be every quarter. But I think that will largely be overwhelmed by some of the movements in the other positions. That's in there and that will be in there, plus or minus a little bit, every quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">It's really going to be -- it's really more driven by asset prices.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Sure, okay. And then last one for me is, as far as the pending swaps clearing rules, when you guys are thinking about this coming into effect here in the next few quarters, do you think that the buffering current pricing of the product works given the enlargement in capital requirements? And how do you see this playing out? How are discussions with your clients going as far as changing? Do you think that the change will be more on the product innovation side, or the pricing side? How do you think about that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Well, when we think about clearing -- as you know, we've been big supporters of clearing. We think it's fundamental to systemic risk reduction. So we've been big proponents, moving clearing forward as quickly as possible. And against that backdrop, we've been building and developing in our business the ability to provide client clearing and the tools and technology and appropriate staff. I'd say that it's probably too early to tell ultimately where we come out with pricing. Like a lot of things, I think there'll be a fair degree of early competition. But we're really in the early innings of this so we'll have to see how the revenue model evolves. But I think the biggest issue is that it fundamentally makes the system safer. And I think -- over time, again difficult to speculate, I think -- as we get clarity around regulatory reform, I think all of these pieces, as they come together, could contribute to greater volumes. So again, difficult to model the revenue outcome.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">David, you mentioned that the backlog is down a little bit quarter-over-quarter. I guess I'm just curious as to -- if you can -- if you would provide some color as to what's driving that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">It were -- when I -- you should just -- I should emphasize the word \"slightly\" when I say it was down quarter-over-quarter. But it really was a very slight decline. As I said, it's still higher than it was at the beginning of the year and it's a very, very slight -- it's a slight decline in the underwriting part, a slight increase in the merger part, and the underwriting decline is a little bit more than the merger increase. But these really are small numbers when I tell you, \"up and down.\"</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. And then just one question on I&amp;L balances. Now that you've had a little bit more time to think about the NPR that came earlier this year, do you have any more thoughts on potentially pairing some of the I&amp;L balances?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">As I said before, I think we're going to -- when there are good opportunities to sell -- again, some of these things will season naturally. It will be time for them to be sold, and we will sell them. And these things will naturally roll off over time kind of as the Basel rules kick in.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question comes from the line of Douglas Sipkin with Susquehanna.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Just a couple of questions. First, I've noticed you guys have introduced preferred stock back into the capital structure, it's modest. But any color on the rationale? I think it's been 2 quarters in a row where that's increased.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Well, those were -- we had these Apex transactions which needed to be remarketed. So these were kind of the end of transactions that were done several years ago. There was nothing new there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Got you. Okay, so then there's no really change in thought process of capital management, it's just a function of the expiration of those.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">That was what those were in there. We'll continue to monitor the markets and see when is the right time to do things and when it's available. But for -- those transactions were older transactions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Got you. Second question. I picked up that you mentioned there was maybe some improvement throughout the quarter, but I guess it wasn't that significant, in terms of activity levels coming in versus leaving the quarter. Any particular products, it sounds like mortgages was one of them, where there was a noticeable improvement versus -- coming into the quarter versus leaving?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">What we saw over the quarter, particularly as the central bank activity picked up, is you really saw capital moving into things like treasuries and mortgages. There was certainly, as we've all seen, a desire to focus on yield-offering products so we've seen the calendar in the debt markets be quite active. Away from that, I wouldn't make any significant comments about the terms of the flows.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Got you. Okay. And then sort of -- I think I know the answer, but with respect to cost cutting and headcount levels, it feels like the most recent initiative will take you guys to where you want to be, given the environment that we're in.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">It'll take us where we want to be for now, and then we'll see kind of how things unfold. And we'll decide if we need to grow, shrink or stay the same based on how the environment feels.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Got you. And then just last question for me. It feels like we get close to seeing a stronger M&amp;A environment, but then it peters out. How much do you think the fiscal cliff uncertainty is weighing on CEOs' confidence and, if somehow we can get past this with everyone feeling good, it would serve as a catalyst? Or are there bigger issues with respect to bigger M&amp;A tickets?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I think the political uncertainty out there has been a big part of what's kept the M&amp;A calendar as low as it's been, with the fiscal cliff, uncertainty in Europe, just general political uncertainty which has caused people to be less confident about growth. I think it's been weighing very heavily on those markets. There's been a -- as we've said before, a lot of dialogue, a lot of companies talking to each other, but CEOs are all hesitant to pull the trigger until they get a little more clarity. And I think, if you saw some clarity, I think you could see a pretty big uptick in volumes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And gentlemen, at this time, there are no further questions. Do you have any closing remarks?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Dane Holmes</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes. We'd just like to thank everyone for joining us on our Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us at the investor relations department.

Thank you. Mr. Holmes, you may begin your conference.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Dane Holmes</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning.

Harvey?</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thanks, Dane. I would like to thank all of you for joining us today. I will give an overview of our fourth quarter and full year results, and then David and I will take your questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Full year net revenues for 2012 were $34.2 billion. Net earnings were $7.5 billion. Earnings per diluted share were $14.13, and our return on common equity was 10.7%. Fourth quarter net revenues were $9.2 billion. Net earnings were $2.9 billion, and earnings per diluted share were $5.60. The operating environment in 2012 was defined by a few significant trends: Substantial central bank activity, improved economic data in the United States and continued political uncertainty. For example, actions and commentary by the European Central Bank played a significant role in moderating concerns about a European linked tail event. At the end of 2011, the ECB announced that it would enhance its long-term refinancing operations to provide term liquidity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">The ECB further demonstrated its commitment during 2012 by affirming its support for the euro and its willingness to make outright purchases in the secondary bond market. In the United States, the Federal Reserve also took steps to support markets and economic growth, announcing further increases in monetary stimulus during the year. In 2012, the U.S. economy posted stable to improving economic data, particularly with developments in unemployment and housing. Over the course of the year, the U.S. economy added nearly 2 million jobs and the housing price index increased by 4% over the past 12 months.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Despite the systemic benefits of Central Bank activity and improved U.S. economic data, our clients continue to struggle with the complex set of issues facing the global economy and the political backdrop. The most obvious recent example was the debate in the United States surrounding the fiscal cliff. These factors translated into mixed activity levels for our corporate client base. For example, global debt issuance increased by 11% year-over-year, with high-yield issuance increasing 38%. In contrast, global equity underwriting volumes were only up 1% and completed global merger and acquisition volumes actually decreased 18% in 2012 and remain very low as a percentage of market capitalization.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We experienced lower activity levels in most of our businesses and general risk aversion by our investment clients. This was offset by improving asset prices and lower volatility, which created a more favorable market-making environment. Although equity and fixed-income asset prices trended up over the course of the year, volumes generally declined given the previously mentioned factors. For example, U.S.-listed equity volumes declined 18% in 2012. And as we all know, the S&amp;P 500 declined by 13%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">While macroeconomic challenges persist, our leadership teams remain focused on enhancing our returns. Drivers of our long-term success include focusing on our clients, prudently managing our risk profile and being disciplined about capital and expenses. I'll now review each of our businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Investment Banking produced fourth quarter net revenues of $1.4 billion, up 21% from the third quarter. The increase was due to higher equity underwriting revenues following a weak third quarter and continued strength in debt underwriting. For the full year, Investment Banking net revenues were $4.9 billion, up 13% from 2011 due to a robust environment for debt issuance. Within Investment Banking, fourth quarter Advisory revenues were $508 million, flat with the third quarter. Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced and completed M&amp;A for 2012. We advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the fourth quarter, including Kraft's $36.1 billion spinoff of its North American grocery business; Walt Disney's $4.1 billion acquisition of Lucasfilm; and Dollar Thrifty's $2.3 billion sale to Hertz. We also advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the fourth quarter: Ralcorp Holdings' $6.8 billion sale to ConAgra; the $4.5 billion sale of eAccess to Softbank; and Gambro's $4 billion sale to Baxter International.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Fourth quarter underwriting net revenues were $897 million, up 37% sequentially as issuance improved relative to the third quarter. Equity underwriting revenues of $304 million increased 61% compared to the third quarter, reflecting increased fuel activity. Goldman Sachs was ranked first in worldwide equity and equity-related and common stock offerings for 2012. Debt underwriting revenues increased 27% to $593 million due to our involvement in several significant transactions and a favorable new issue environment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">During the fourth quarter, we participated in noteworthy underwriting transactions, including AIG's $6.4 billion sale of its remaining stake in AIA; AvalonBay Communities' $2.2 billion follow-on offering; and Clear Channel Outdoor's $2.7 billion high-yield offering. Our Investment banking backlog increased compared with the end of the third quarter. It was also higher than year end 2011.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Let me now turn to Institutional Client Services, which is comprised of FICC and equities client execution, commissions and fees, and securities services. Net revenues were $4.3 billion in the fourth quarter, up 4% from the third quarter. Net revenues within Institutional Client Services improved as the fourth quarter included an approximately $500 million gain from the sale of our hedge fund administration business. Full year net revenues of $18.1 billion for Institutional Client Services were up 5% relative to 2011 and included a $714 million DVA loss. Excluding the impact of DVA, revenues were up 13% year-over-year and benefited from an improving market environment with tighter credit spreads, higher equity prices and lower levels of volatility.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">FICC Client Execution net revenues were $2 billion in the fourth quarter, including a DVA loss of $79 million, and were down 8% sequentially as certain businesses reflected seasonally low levels of activity. Credit revenues increased significantly as client activity was supported by a favorable market backdrop, which included a relatively benign macro environment. Robust primary issuance and tighter credit spreads also helped.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Currency revenues also increased. Commodities revenues were higher compared to weaker third quarter results, although absolute levels of client activity remained pretty low. While rates and mortgages were lower sequentially, both businesses were strong contributors to the franchise. For the full year, FICC Client Execution net revenues of $9.9 billion were up 10% relative to 2011. Excluding the impact of DVA, revenues were up 20% compared to 2011, as markets in 2012 were less turbulent and benefited from an improved backdrop in Europe, modest growth in the U.S. and strong central bank activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees and securities services, net revenues for the fourth quarter were $2.3 billion, up 18% sequentially and included $47 million in DVA losses. Excluding the impact of DVA, revenues were up 12% relative to the third quarter. Equities client execution revenues decreased 10% sequentially to $764 million, reflecting fewer client-driven opportunities in our cash market-making business. Commissions and fees were $722 million, roughly flat with third quarter levels. Securities services net revenues of $818 million reflected the $500 million gain on sale that was previously mentioned. For the full year, equities produced net revenues of $8.2 billion, consistent with 2011.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to risk. Average daily VaR in the fourth quarter was $76 million, down from $81 million in the third quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Now I'll review Investing &amp; Lending, which includes both direct investing and investing through funds across various asset classes, as well as lending activities. Investing and lending produced net revenues of $2 billion in the fourth quarter. Our investment in ICBC produced a $334 million gain in the quarter. Other equity investments generated $789 million in gains, reflecting realized and unrealized gains on private equity investments and mark-ups related to public equity investments, as equity markets were stronger in Asia and Europe.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $485 million, largely driven by tightening credit spreads and net interest income. Other revenues of $365 million consists primarily of operating revenues from our consolidated investment entities and are largely offset by equivalent expenses. For the full year, Investing &amp; Lending generated net revenues of $5.9 billion, driven by a $408 million gain on our investment in ICBC, $2.4 billion in gains from other equity investments, $1.9 billion of net revenues from debt securities and loans, and $1.2 billion of other investments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In Investment Management, we reported fourth quarter net revenues of $1.5 billion, up 26% from the third quarter, primarily as a result of $344 million in incentive fees generated from the firm's alternative asset products. Management and other fees were 5% higher at $1.1 billion. For the full year, Investment Management net revenues were $5.2 billion, up 4% from 2011 levels and stronger incentive fees.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">During the fourth quarter, assets under supervision increased $14 billion to $965 billion, largely due to net inflows of $15 billion into other client assets, mainly as a result of Advisory mandates. Total assets under management were essentially unchanged. On a full year basis, assets under supervision increased 8% as other client assets received $39 billion of net inflows. We ended the year with $111 billion of other client assets. Assets under management increased 3%, reflecting net market appreciation and was partially offset by outflows.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior-year equity awards and other items such as benefits, increased 6% to $12.9 billion for 2012 and translated into a compensation-to-net-revenues ratio of 37.9%. It is important to note that our lower compensation ratio in 2012 is, in part, a byproduct of our efficiency efforts that began in early 2011.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Fourth quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.9 billion, 24% higher than the third quarter. Other expenses were significantly higher, reflecting net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings of $260 million, an increase of approximately $200 million over the third quarter. Based on the provision taken this quarter, combined with previous reserves, we have fully accounted for the independent foreclosure review settlement. The fourth quarter also included a $157 million donation to Goldman Sachs Gives, our donor advised charitable fund. Finally, depreciation and amortization increased by approximately $100 million, driven by impairments to certain investment entities and our New York Stock Exchange designated market maker rights. For the full year, non-compensation expenses were down 4%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Total staff at year-end were approximately 32,400, down 3% from year-end 2011, and 9% from year-end 2010. Our effective tax rate was 33.3% for 2012. During the quarter, we repurchased 12.7 million shares of common stock for a total cost of $1.5 billion. For the full year, we repurchased 42 million shares for a total cost of $4.6 billion. Historically, our financial success has been a function of broad and deep client relationships, our best-in-class people, our disciplined approach to locating financial and human capital and a culture of collaboration and partnership. The value of this partnership is highlighted in challenging market environments and drove our results in 2012.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Looking forward, we believe that we are well positioned to expand our client franchise globally. For corporate clients, we will continue to leverage our strong M&amp;A, equity and debt underwriting positions. For investing and other institutional clients, we will continue to rely on the quality of our content and execution. We will remain very disciplined in our approach to expenses, balancing near-term benefits to our margins against longer term revenue opportunities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As we gain greater clarity on regulatory changes, particularly capital requirements, we will respond accordingly. For example, given the Basel III capital changes that we incur as an owner of our own reinsurance business, we are considering a potential sale of the majority stake in the business. We have strong risk-adjusted capitalization, which provides protection to shareholders against tail events. In addition, our capital levels also create opportunities. First, it positions the firm to help our clients navigate an uncertain economic event. It also allows us to provide capital where capacity is diminished. We are committed to effectively deploying our capital and maintaining dry powder to meet future client needs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We will also return capital to shareholders when appropriate returns aren't available. And our capital trends in 2012 reflected our measured approach as our estimated Basel Tier 1 capital ratio increased from approximately 8% to nearly 9%, despite returning $5.5 billion to shareholders via share buybacks and dividends.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">We are encouraged by the early signs of improvement in the markets and economy but remain cautious given the complexity of the risk and challenges. The quality of our advice and execution in today's challenging markets serves as a foundation for maintaining long-term client relationships and ultimately meeting the needs of all of our stakeholders.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Everyone at Goldman Sachs remains steadfast in their commitment to serving our client franchise. We have a deep appreciation for our responsibility to all of our constituents: clients, shareholders, regulators, our employees and, of course, the broader financial system. We believe that there's a shared interest among our constituents to manage the firm in a way that supports economic growth and sustainability. Our firm is fully committed to filling that responsibility.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">With that, I'd like to take a moment to thank David on behalf of the firm for his significant contributions to Goldman Sachs over his 32-year career. There is no doubt that our clients, employees, regulators and shareholders have all benefited from his unwavering commitment, sound judgment and devotion to the firm's culture and principles. As a personal note, I really want to thank you. You've been a tremendous partner, David, and not only during this transition. I truly can't thank you enough. I look forward to working with you as a member of our Board of Directors. For those of you who aren't keeping track, this is David's 55th consecutive earnings call. It is only fitting that he provide some closing comments. David?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Thank you, Harvey. As many of you know, I spent my entire career at Goldman Sachs. So it's all I know. I always believed that it was a special place. That is a perception which has been validated over the last several years given my experiences during this period of stress. I witnessed the strength of our client franchise, the quality and dedication of our people and the commitment of our shareholders. It was an honor to be asked to join the Board of Directors. I look forward to continuing to serve as a steward for shareholders in that role. It is a responsibility that I take with full confidence in the strength of the client franchise, the financial health of the company, and the caliber and devotion of our people. I would also like to thank all of our shareholders, debt investors and research analysts for their support of the firm and me, personally. I leave knowing that I am turning the role over to Harvey, who has the skills and judgment to warrant that same level of support.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Thank you, again, for listening today, and now Harvey and I are happy to take your questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p5\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">[Operator Instruction]</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">[Audio Gap]</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Your first question is from the line of Howard Chen with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">I think everyone would acknowledge 2012 was a pretty tough year for the industry, but yet when all is said and done, the firm posted nearly 11% return on equity. Just given where revenues and where you decided to accrue comps, can you just discuss the significance of that 11%? Is that in a threshold ROE that we should think about that you don't want to fall below in a challenging environment?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So what I would say about 2012, obviously, as you mentioned, certainly some elements of the marketplace were particularly challenging. What put us in a position to achieve the ROE, really, were the steps we took over the last 2 years in terms of managing expenses and being quite disciplined. But in terms of what we're able to achieve in the future, we're going to have to see what the market opportunity brings to us. But this was a year where, like all years, we took everything into account, performance, the competitive dynamic. And as I said, we benefited from the steps that we took over the past 2 years. But quite frankly, I don't think  -- while we'll be pleased with the performance of the environment, it's not particularly aspirational. We'd like to do better.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay. And then switching gears, Harvey, with respect to Investing &amp; Lending, you noted the improved realization environment and mix, as many of your investments have been in the ground for a few years now, I was hoping you could provide us some thoughts on how you think about the realization pipeline, give us a little bit more detail on that appetite to sell today if markets were cooperative.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So the ability to monetize, as you know, is really driven by 2 factors. Obviously, it's market performance, but it's also the idiosyncratic nature of your own portfolio. So in the past year, obviously, there are opportunities. You could argue that our performance exceeded that of the marketplace in terms of what you might expected. But that was this past year, and our portfolio performed well. I think in some quarters, it will perform well; in some quarters, we won't perform as well relative to the marketplace, but the market will drive that. Certainly, over time, with events around the world, we feel like we'll see attractive investment opportunities. But in terms of the scheduled monetization, difficult to predict.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay, great. And then just finally, for me, I realize we are now 10 trading days into the new year. But just given all that happened at the end of 2012 with the fiscal cliff and so forth, just curious how the year has begun.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Too early to tell with only 10 business days into the quarter. You could paint a picture of concern given events in Europe and certainly, events in Washington that could be disruptive. If you talk to our economist, our economist would say that we'll see pretty modest growth for the first half of the year in the developed economies and it'll exceed that in the growth economies in maybe the second half of the year. But it's difficult to anticipate that. We do feel pretty well positioned from a business point of view, whether in our Investment Banking franchise and certainly across the firm, to capitalize on opportunities. But too early to tell.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Nomura.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">I think risk-weighted assets were down 8% quarter-on-quarter, but GAAP was down only about 1%. I know those are different animals. Just curious what drove the RWA in the quarter and then if you had any thoughts on as we look forward, obviously, just on what's the path going forward for RWA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So I wouldn't focus so much on the quarter-over-quarter move, more so, really, on the end of last year to the end of this year. So that's roughly 100 basis points, 8% to nearly 9%. And as we've said before, as we get visibility into the rules, we will deploy our teams with tools, and we'll be able to react. So what we're really seeing over the course of the year is the effort to be more efficient with capital and, of course, the earnings performance. And so we will continue to react as we get more visibility into all the rules.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So is that a way of saying that as the rules come out, I think this quarter, many companies have been pushing through getting other model approval. This was a little more driven by that versus actual assets going out the door?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Yes, we're not in a position to comment on any model approvals.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay. How about in a different way. And I understand the sensitivity. As the rules come out, I think Goldman's, historically, been very good at pushing out whatever the new rules are to the trading desks on the technology on the desktop and it makes the company more efficient in that manner. Can you just maybe comment where are we in that process? And am I correct to say that, that is how we can envision higher ROEs going forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Well, the way I would think about it is the performance is going to drive the ROEs, and that will be about our competitive position and ability to deliver our franchise to our clients relative to others in the context of what the market provides. With respect to managing our capital, I think you should expect us to continue to be disciplined. And when we get visibility around rules, we will look to be particularly responsive. But we want to be very careful not to overreact before we have a rule, and we don't want to underreact after we have a rule. So we hope to do more.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Excellent. On the positive side, the competitive landscape has definitely shifted a little bit. I think there's a lot of pressure under some of the European Investment Banks to do some form of shrinkage, small or large. Do you view that as big opportunity? I know that over the past year or so or 2 during the European crisis, you guys have commented that it might be your best near-term opportunity. Is that still in motion? And how are you going about positioning for it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">I wouldn't say that it's the best near-term opportunity. I think those things are always difficult to weigh. But I think if you -- if you're thinking about sort of longer-term strategy across multiple years, certainly, capacity leaving the industry broadly and specifically opportunities in Europe, we think we're well positioned, and they look attractive to us, but we'll have to see what materializes. I think the reason why I focus on near-term is it's very difficult to be too precise about how these things unfold and certainly when.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Got you. Last one's a quickie, and I -- if you're schooled in David Viniar answers, I know it's going to be a quick answer, too. But this year, revs were up 19%, comp dollars were up 6%, and non-comp was down 4%. That's a fantastic mix for shareholders. I know we can't predict the future, so let's just make believe for a second that revenues will be flat on the go-forward basis. In a flat revenue world, does comp ratio stay and non-comp expenses keep trending lower?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So I think you have to go back again to the -- to how we manage the company and how we think about compensation specifically. So there are a whole host there of factors that go into that. One is going to be how our performance is and certainly, that's going to be reflected in compensation. The competitive dynamic is certainly in there. And then, of course, this is a balance issue, obviously, in terms of providing returns to shareholders. And this year, we hope we got the balance right. As I said, we're not satisfied. We'd like to do better. But again, it will be determined by what the market opportunity provides us in the future.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So we've seen 2 quarters where core revenues have probably come in a bit better than expected, not only for you, but the industry. It feels like activity may be stabilizing, hopefully improving. But when we look at the liquidity reserve, it still seems pretty high. I think in the past you said when the environment gets better, you could see that trend down. So I guess basically, does that relationship still stand? Do you sense any improvement? Or are there still enough regulatory uncertainties on liquidity and funding side to remain ultra conservative?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Well, I think what I'd say, just as a matter of principle, we're always going to be conservative with our liquidity. I'd like to say there's 2 core lifebloods to the firm: one is our clients, and the other is our liquidity. And so we're going to stay very focused on both. Look, there's a lot of uncertainty in the world, and I agree with you that when you look back over the past 6 months, certainly, the world feels a bit better. Clients, generally, although there was a fairly significant amount of risk aversion, got better towards the end of the year. And we'll see how this year goes. But there's still a lot of things in front of the world, so I wouldn't expect any significant shift.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. And then just a follow-up on Glenn's question on the RWAs. Maybe just -- like when you look at the rules and trying to manage the assets and the capital, what percent -- I know it's a easy question, probably tougher to answer, but what percent of the rules do you feel you have clarity on? Meaning, like what inning are we in that process, fully getting clarity so you can manage your assets?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So, yes, that's a hard question. I would say that I'll try to be as narrow as possible. I would say that on capital, I don't know. Maybe we're in the sixth inning in terms of capital rule visibility. Maybe some people could argue the seventh. But that's kind of it using a baseball analogy. I think the broader issue is the collective visibility into all rules, whether it's Volcker, the impact of Dodd-Frank, things that impact globally. And so -- and there, I don't think we have a lot of collective visibility into the weight of that. And actually, I think it's difficult for the regulators to really assess all of that, which, quite frankly, is a concern for the industry and, obviously, it's a concern for the global economy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Right, okay. And then last one, you mentioned just the reinsurance business maybe putting that up for sale. Just wondering, I mean, it might be too early, but any size of that business? And maybe same thing on Investing &amp; Lending, you guys have said in the past, there's areas of that business where it's on the lending side. So you'll continue to operate that business and then there's other areas that will wind down over time. So any update on the assets or the revenues related to those businesses and then capital that would be released and redeployed elsewhere?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So I'm not in a position to comment on the reinsurance business beyond what's in the release. What I would say with respect to Investing &amp; Lending is those are core competencies of the firm. And so when we've -- for example, when we had visibility on part of the Volcker Rule, we took steps around certain businesses. But at this stage, this will be about how we adapt to rules as we get further visibility. And so I don't know necessarily that we would say we'd deemphasize anything in Investing &amp; Lending at this stage. Now of course, over time, as businesses like the reinsurance business are maybe better held in other people's hands and we can be a minority owner because of capital reasons, then we'll make those decisions. But that'll be on a business-by-business basis.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">One question to follow up on that. I'm just sort of assuming that if you guys hold the minority stakes then in the reinsurance business, it would probably be below the Basel III threshold to avoid a hickey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">[indiscernible]</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. And then also how should we think about [indiscernible] shot, how should we think about a comp ratio on [indiscernible] revenues [indiscernible] that would be at a lower rate than it would be for other businesses in the firm? But can you maybe provide some color to help us out on that front?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I think it's really important to emphasize the point that when we think about the comp ratio, we think about it in terms of the aggregate of the firm. And then within that, we compensate across the various business units, and we build it up individual by individual.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. So -- but you'll clearly take into account revenue mix when you start to think about those allocations, right? Because that's basically what is the sum of the parts.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yes. I would say it more simply. We don't look to overpay anybody.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. So then with that in mind, then you could easily say that given the competitive environment right now for talent on the Street, that the improvement in the comp ratio should be at least somewhat sustainable for the benefit of shareholders here in the near-term, is that fair?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Well, I guess you could surmise that. As far as I can tell, even as capacity has been leaving the industry, there's been a huge demand for Goldman Sachs people. And so the competitive dynamic in aggregate may feel much better. But for very talented people at Goldman Sachs, they're very attractive.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Brennan, it's David. You've heard me say this many times before, so I'll just say it again. We don't set a comp ratio. We don't start the process and say here's the comp ratio. We compensate our people individually, and we take into account the performance of the firm, the competitive environment all the time. And we're always looking at those things. So it's hard for us to say what it's going to be going forward.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yes, no, that's fair. Unfortunately, we have to set a comp ratio in our model, so I've got to give it a shot. And then I guess last one for me, any color on deferrals? I mean, it's been sort of my understanding that you guys have historically had less deferred comp than peers, which clearly gives you greater flexibility. We're hearing a lot of noise around deferrals here given the calendar and where we are. But do you intend to try to keep that flexibility? What's your view on that front?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So there are no deferrals. And I think you're right to say that you have to be very thoughtful when you do that because there's a bit of mortgaging the future. And so, no, there's been no deferrals. I'm sorry, no additional deferrals.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay, I was going to clarify that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I'm getting my -- I got my last bit of mentoring from David there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski from Autonomous Research.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research LLP</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">The CFTC obviously pushed back timing of some of the OTC reforms with respect to central clearing, at least to -- pretty close to the middle of the year. And I know this is kind of a narrow question, but I'm just interested in how you think about it. All else equal, would you expect that revenues in FICC from or broadly from OTC Derivatives transactions would be higher in the first half as a result of just that change, or is not -- that not the right way to think about it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I think it's a good question. I think that the only case study we have is really history. And when you look back over history, history is proving that -- a couple things: One, it's proven that rule changes, and the ultimate impact on market structure, incredibly difficult to predict. I would say -- and I didn't really feel this way about a year ago. I thought that the rule delays or uncertainty around rules, I didn't think was having an impact in terms of client activity. I do think as we get more clarity on rule certainty, it may ultimately impact client activity to the positive. Now having said that, I wouldn't trade off that delay for bad rule-making, and I think the CFTC and other regulators have been pretty thoughtful about taking the steps to delay rules because the single most important thing is that the market has an opportunity to adapt because we just -- we don't want to increase systemic risk while the regulators are trying to put the rules in place. So I think all these delays have been quite thoughtful.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research LLP</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And from a competitive perspective, just to one of the points that you just alluded to, as the changes in the regulatory environment, for example, Basel III capital requirements get better understood and your competitors move closer to full adoption, do you feel like the pricing dynamic for transactions that have a big slug of capital that has to be priced into them has become more rational?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I'm not so sure it's necessarily capital rules. I think broadly speaking, it's a level-playing field and so we all have the same rule set. The way we have to differentiate ourselves is by leaning into our strengths. And we have a history of our clients wanting capital, and we want to differentiate ourselves by providing capital. And so I think it's really how you execute. Everybody's going to live with the same rule set.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research LLP</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">But do you feel like over the last couple of years, competitive pricing has really been rational with respect to what those medium- to longer-term capital requirements are? And if it hasn't been as much so as you would've liked, do you feel like it's gotten closer?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I think that -- and now we're getting into more art than science. I think that competitive response as it relates to things like capital changes, that's a very -- that's something that plays out over the intermediate to long term. In the short run, you can see a rational behavior by competitors, which can't be explained by any capital rule. I would say -- and I'm not sure this is related all to capital, but I do think that the crisis itself at the margin had made people much more disciplined about their capital deployment. And so, for example, I don't even know if this is an indicator that you could extrapolate into your question, but in the fourth quarter, there was an amazing amount of log activity. There were days where David and I were working with our teams in banking and the financing group on sometimes 4 or 5 inquiries. If you ask me on that particular day in December, did pricing feel a bit more rational? Yes. But I couldn't tell you if that same day occurred this January, whether or not it would be as rational. But over years, the market makes people more rational.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research LLP</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes, it's helpful. And then one last question, which follows up a little bit on something that was being talked about before. In Investing &amp; Lending, as you'd said, when it became very, very clear that proprietary activities were going to be precluded, you shot a bunch of that down. What other business adjustments, not necessarily shutdowns, but significant changes to parts of I&amp;L, are you either doing or contemplating? For example, in the lending and distressed debt trading parts of the business?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Well, I would say there are obviously a number of rules that can have incremental impact there, Volcker being one of them. But we'll see Volcker when it comes out, and we'll respond accordingly. But also, those businesses obviously tended to have more capital. And so we have no immediate plans for any changes, but to the extent we need to respond again, we'll do it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research LLP</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">David, farewell. Thanks again so much for all your help over the years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Thanks, Guy, I appreciate it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question is from the line of Roger Freeman with Barclays.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Let me just pick up there on Guy's question. On I&amp;L, I mean, you've kind of got, I think you said, a decent amount of clarity on the capital portion. There's still other pieces, including Volcker, outstanding. But -- and some more of this sort of traditional, sort of the equity investments area, I mean, is that -- that's an area that presumably you'd continue to invest in or maybe even pick up again because I think that's been somewhat of a lull, if the returns are there, right? I mean, you'd look at this just like any private equity investor, just with the return threshold based on the capital requirements, right?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes, it would be just like that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. And then separately, in -- on comp, the -- so some of the reduced ratio sounds like it kind of came out of the restructuring efforts over the past 1.5 years or so. Like how much of that sort of decline in the ratio do you attribute to that versus sort of the market environment, competitive environment?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes, we don't -- we don't think about it that way in terms of parsing it. I understand why you'd ask the question. I think that what we would say is the following: obviously, there was a lot of operating leverage in the business this year, and you see the translation of that in terms of the increased revenues into all the metrics. But in terms of how we think about commenting, David discussed it earlier, it's going to be performance-driven and then we take all of those other factors into account, including the balance and what our shareholders need.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. And then -- and I guess you've kind of touched on this, but the liquidity levels remain still at the highs. With the environment more stable at this point, what do you kind of look for to bring that down, if you have any plans to?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I have no plans to bring it down, so I haven't looked at it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. That's it for now. Okay, thanks and good luck to you, David.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">One kind of nitpicky question. But on the Investing &amp; Lending in the debt side, can you give us a sense as to realized versus unrealized?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes. I think it's something like a little more than 1/2. Feels like it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">On the debt side, remember, there's interest...</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I'm sorry, on the debt side.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">There's interest in there as well. And I would think that it would be more unrealized on the debt side than realized. But we can come back to the breakdown. But remember, a big part of that is interest also.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Right. No, I'm definitely taking the interest piece out. Just asking on the noninterest piece. Okay. And is that...</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes, we can follow up with you. I don't think I'm far off, but we'll double check for you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. All right, cool. And then on the equity side, we can follow up on that, too?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Sorry, can you repeat the question?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">On the equity side, the realized versus unrealized. Is that mostly unrealized? Is that fair?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yes. It's a bit more than 1/2 on that also.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. All right. And then I know we discussed the clearing question. I just wanted to understand how you're thinking about managing the potential outcomes here. Because as initial margin does get charged to the buy side, whether or not it goes on schedule or is a little bit delayed, how are you thinking about setting yourselves up for what could be a changed behavior on the client side when initial margin comes through?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So this is an important question because you could extrapolate, in some respects, our strategy and philosophy around reg reform pretty broadly in this context. So it's incredibly important for us to serve our clients as best we can today. And so hard to truly anticipate what any will change, initial margin, for example, will have on their behavior, but we know we need to be there for them today. And so we'll adapt as they adapt. And again, this is a very careful balance because our view is you need to be incredibly focused as the rules come into frame, clearly. I think that's obvious. But there can be quite a penalty, I think, paid for overreacting. And so if you ask me -- if I answer the question very narrowly, we have no explicit plans to adjust around that. But when we see the rules and we work with our clients, we'll work with them as closely as possible to adapt and make sure that their needs are fulfilled.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Right. So we have some examples of this in the energy market, right, because we've already seen some rule change and had some behavior move from swaps to futures. And so I'm just wondering if that has given you any sense of experience with regard to how you might behave as the other products come online.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I don't think it's as much, for example, swaps to futures, although it could be, and it could end up looking just like the energy market. But clients, of course, have been large users of futures for many, many years. And so they always could have used futures. So that was always a choice. I think a good example of regulatory reform impact would be the collection of rules, whether it was decimalization or Reg ATS, et cetera in the equity markets in 1999. I think it was in 2000 in the early part of the decade. And I think that had transformational effects, obviously, on the equity markets. We all know that now in retrospect, and that forced us to make significant changes in our business. We had to reduce staff significantly. Back in the day, a very small portion of what we did in the equity business was electronic. Now, on any given day, the vast majority of what we do will be done electronically. And so I think it's hard to predict, but the key issue is being very close to our clients during that period. But it's really about how we adapt. And so I'm not trying to evade your question. I'm just saying it's too early to speculate on how we'd adapt. But we just have to execute.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Right. So be nimble and carry some capacity to manage through it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes. I mean, I can't imagine reducing capacity and then trying to rebuild it. That would be really hard.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question is from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Christoph M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Just kind of always believing that people's actions speak louder than what they can say sometimes. Looking at your share buybacks and going back to 2010, every single quarter, the kind of the share buyback has been in the range of somewhere between $1 billion and $1.5 billion. And conversely, every single quarter since late 2010, your tangible common equity at the end of the period has been $63 billion or $64 billion. So I'm curious, which is the target and which is the plug? Is it that you've decided that at this kind of level of profitability, yes, $5 billion or $6 billion a year is the right amount of buyback? Or is it just that $63 billion, $64 billion is all you need to run a world-class investment bank and anything above that, you can return to shareholders?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes. So I wish the science was that precise. But unfortunately for you all, and for us, it's not that precise. It's much more dynamic. And the way I would frame it is we want to be very conservative about our capital. And that's the first priority. And so we will evaluate it on a quarter-by-quarter basis. And certainly now with CCAR, we work hand-in-hand with our regulators to make sure that we have a conservative capital plan.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Christoph M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. But I don't know -- just as a follow-up to that, I guess. In the context of JPMorgan allocating about $40 billion to its investment bank; BofA, I think is in the same area code; and obviously all the other banks and European banks generally have less than that, what would be the argument that you need more than $63 billion; $64 billion of tangible common to run a world-class investment bank?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Well, as it relates to us, like I said, we want to be conservative about our capital, but we also want to be positioned because capital can make us -- can put us in a very competitive offensive position. I don't know how JPMorgan and BofA allocate their capital, but probably a better question for them.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">If I could circle back to the OTC derivative topic here, just as we think about the FICC businesses specifically, have you talked about the mix of cash versus noncash?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I'm sorry, did you say can I talk about it? I couldn't hear the exact question. I apologize.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Sorry. The question is, within the FICC trading businesses, have you talked about what's driven by cash versus noncash?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">No, we've not.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I had one large investment bank, when I was talking to them about the whole potential revenue give-up from swaps, they had noted to me that probably only about 15% of FICC revenues were noncash. And obviously, within that, there would be some structural stuff that wouldn't be at risk.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yes. So we haven't talked about it. I'll give you the following observation. Certainly, post 2008, there was a real desire, I think a very rational desire and a natural shift by the whole industry, driven by the clients to really focus on simplicity away from complexity. So you lost some of the most -- what I'll call the most complex aspects of derivatives, the correlation businesses and things like that. And I don't see those returning. So I don't see those as lost revenue opportunities although who knows, maybe someday, far away, they will. But I think that because of that, you've seen a mix shift that was to cash, but that feels to me like it's been in place for a while.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. And just any comment on whether it's for you or you think for the fee pool overall that 15% is noncash?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">No. No comment on that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. And then just separately, as we think about kind of the FICC revenue drivers, whether it's this year or beyond, I get a lot of questions that debt issuance has been so strong the last couple years. How can that be repeated? Credit spreads have tightened so much, how can that be repeated? And then obviously, when you talk to people in the business, they remind you that secondary trading has been weak, and it's been very low-margin business or a lot of low-margin business. Can you just talk a little bit about the puts and takes and if there's any way to quantify the drag from weaker secondary trading or some of the opportunity as you move away from lower margin areas to higher margin areas?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Well, I think that in all these businesses, and let's just take the securities vision because you're talking about, for example, cash bond trading and secondary market activity, we benefit from basically the diversity and the collection of businesses. So yes, credit -- the credit business may be busier than the mortgage business in a particular day and a particular month. So that's how we think about it. In terms of secondary volumes, it's not really particularly surprising to me. Although maybe if you'd asked me this question a year ago, I would have gotten the answer wrong, that just given the incredible influx of capital into the bond space, that managers themselves are not rotating positions as much. It's been very directional. And so I don't know. I wouldn't be making any forecasts that secondary bond trading levels would be dramatically lower or dramatically higher the second half of this year, for example.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. And then just lastly, on the reinsurance business, and I apologize if you disclosed this in the Q, but within the equities business, you talk about -- in a footnote, there was $1 billion of reinsurance revenues for 2012. Is that all one -- driven all by one company or the one stake that you're talking about? Or would there be a couple other pieces in that as well?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">At this stage, I really can't comment beyond what's in the footnote.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I just would like to get maybe your thoughts longer term. I think if we look at the return profile, certainly, double digits is positive. But I think a good contribution came from private equity, which, under the Volcker Rule, may shrink over time and the core business being dragged down by still pretty low returns in fixed income. So when we think -- not just the next year or so, but look further out, do you see whether it's long-dated derivatives, things like that? Is it -- are we just missing that there's significant amount of RWA mitigation over time rather than just looking out the next year or 2, but beyond that, that is significant enough to get returns up? Or do we have to see some material improvement in the business mix to get the returns up in FICC?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So again, I'm going to sound kind of redundant here. I think predicting multiple years in the future is really hard. I actually think predicting 6 months in the future is really difficult. And so again, what I would say is the following: we're going to focus on making sure that our institutional clients can deal with us in any business they want, and we want to be best in class. And we're far from perfect. So there's certainly businesses we need to work on, and we can be better and we can take advantage of our improvements relative to competitors. But...</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">But you should have a view though. I'm sorry, you should have a view though, at least internally, of what your long-dated high RWA-type products that you expect to roll off, if there's a lot -- do you have any sense? Or can you give us any sense of is that a lot, a little or just -- that would be helpful.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yes, I don't have that data with me. But if you're talking about sort of additions that are on the books with clients versus roll off, passive roll off, which we've disclosed previously, yet we obviously -- I think you should -- rest assured, we study all that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. Maybe just on the liquidity, can you give us any thoughts on what the new LCR ratio language -- how you guys you feel you're positioned for the LCR?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So again, we finished with a strong liquidity position, with $175 billion in GCE. We have no immediate concerns regarding the LCR. We thought it was good. Actually, like a lot of these rules, that the regulators revise the rules in the process, and the final rule deemed more thoughtful and well considered than the proposed rule. But no immediate concern.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question is from the line of Kian Abouhossein with JPMorgan.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yes. I just wanted to come back to capital. And apologies if I missed it. But have you given the Basel III risk-weighted assets for the quarter, as well as the ratio? And if you have, could you please repeat it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">No, we haven't yet. But we did talk about the fact, obviously, that we finished near 9%, up 100 basis points over the year in Basel III.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. And you have -- and in terms of -- you have given a risk-weighted asset guidance in the recent presentation, November, of $700 billion relative to about $725 billion in the third quarter, and it sounded to me like a very small number. I know you don't include proactive mitigation in your number. But I wonder, in the $700 billion, how much growth of risk-weighted assets have you included there between that number in the third quarter and the fourth -- in 2013 year end that you've given? Is there material growth in that number?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">No. There's no material growth in that number.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And in terms of mitigation, can you give us any more details of how we should look at that, considering that you're talking about how your systems are built in order to allocate capital more efficiently? How should we think about the $700 billion versus what is really achievable, even if you talk more in terms of subjective measures?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Kian, I'm not quite sure what you're trying to get at. But if you really want details of all of this, we're happy to follow up with you later. You know we're very focused on this. And you can see, we increased where we are by about 100 basis points over the course of the year. But if you want more details on that, we're happy to follow up with you later.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yes. I think the reason why we're struggling a bit with the question is because quite frankly, you'll see this as we do it. And so it's difficult for us to forecast in a way, obviously, that you'd like us to.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yes. But you are constantly beating expectations, and you're kind of -- your mitigation seems to be much well ahead of the curve than I think what you're clearly alluding to in the $700 billion, which doesn't include any mitigation for your proactive measures. And I get the impression that the number that could be achieved is significantly lower, and that's kind of what I'm trying to get to. But we can discuss it afterwards. On the -- just on the Investing &amp; Lending expenses, to be honest, I don't understand that line. I mean, you have expense of about $2 billion to $3 billion. I always think about this business like a private equity business. And your cost-to-income ratio, however, is significantly higher, and your expense line is higher. What is in these expenses? I would have thought this should be more like a 25%, 30% cost-income-ratio business but obviously, I don't understand it. So can you explain to me what these expenses are? I mean, I assume there are only a few hundred people. I assume there are only a few hundred people in this division.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Dane Holmes</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Are you referring to the segment?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yes. Yes. Sorry. The segment Investing &amp; Lending where you give expenses on the filing -- in the filings.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I don't know that off the top of my head, so why don't we come back and follow up with you?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">But I assume there are only a few hundred people running...</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">If David can do it off the top of his head, I'd have him answer it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I mean, there are only few hundred -- I assume there are only a few hundred people running in this division. I can't believe there's thousands of -- I would be even surprised if it's 1,000 people. So I'm just wondering why you're having $2 billion to $3 billion of expenses. Is it interest expenses or is it something else? I just don't understand why there's such a big expense level.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yes, we'll come back to you on it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. And last question, staffing. Can you talk about -- and you've done a great job on reducing staffing this year. But can you talk a little bit about staffing trends that you would expect to see in your business this year? And maybe, business or geography, if there's maybe a mix change.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">No. So there are no plans one way or another I think worth discussing. That'll all be driven bottoms up by the businesses, as it always is, in terms of the opportunities they see and how they're investing around the world in talent.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">And should we -- does that mean -- staffing sounds like -- it's fair to say that staffing levels today are not -- shouldn't be too dissimilar to the end of this year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">That'll be very driven by the environment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Your next question is from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Just a couple of, I guess, quick questions for you, Harvey. First of all, in terms of the net outflows in the non-money market side of things in the fourth quarter, they were negative net 18. That's down pretty visibly from the third quarter, but more in line with the fourth quarter. Is that just a seasonal trend? Or is there something else going on there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Are you talking about in asset management? Asset management?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Yes, on Page 12 of the release.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Money markets had inflows in the fourth quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Oh, I'm sorry. I meant non-money market flows.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Yes. I don't think there was anything particular there. I think that's just related more to client and investor activity. There's nothing significant in there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay. And then, I guess, in the bigger picture, Harvey, you mentioned that the backlog was up a bit versus third quarter and up a bit year-over-year. I guess I'm just curious in terms of your outlook, if you care to provide it, on M&amp;A. There seems to be a lot of media attention and I think some client attention on the potential opportunities for M&amp;A, given the potential slowdown in the U.S. and possibly in Europe, in those economies, and the cash balances. Is there any greater sense of M&amp;A volumes coming in -- or announced M&amp;A volumes coming in 2013 than you've seen in 2012?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Whether or not things are going to be announced, obviously, very difficult to predict. And I think it's most -- when you talk to our investment bankers and our clients, what they'll say is that the uncertainty in the economic environment globally and certainly the political backdrop in the large economies has left CEOs in a position where they've been quite conservative. And as you see, it translated into all the things you described: large cash holdings, lots of efficiencies. And so I think that will be -- my own opinion, that'll be a lagging outcome in terms of -- when people really feel there's confidence and certainty, then there'll be more motivation to consummate transactions. But very difficult to predict those, as you know.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">What's the dollar amount of the backlog quarter-over-quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Oh, we don't disclose that. Sorry.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay. What is Goldman's ROE target?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Is that a question for David or is that a question for me?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Well, we want to go with the guy who's going to be around to try to achieve it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Sorry, I didn't mean to make light of that question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>David A. Viniar</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">You'd get the same answer.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I apologize. So look. With respect to the ROE target, or the absence of an ROE target, there, quite frankly, over the past several years, there just hasn't been enough information in the marketplace, whether it was capital rules, clarity on Volcker, Title VII, et cetera. And so at this stage, we just don't feel we have enough information to give you a target. Now having said that, what you should expect from us and you will continue to see from us is that we remain committed to superior returns over the long term, and we want to provide absolute superior terms and relative superior terms. So that's our focus. But we have no target.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">When do you think you'll have enough information on the capital rules, Volcker and anything else that's holding you back from having a formal target?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I think if you had been sitting here a year ago, you probably would have felt like maybe there's more clarity. But as I said earlier, I think the regulators have done a very, very smart thing, locally and globally, by delaying the implementation, because it's so much simultaneous change. Even in Title VII for itself, which is one suite of rules, the regulators have an enormous task in front of them in terms of rolling out these rules. And so that's just one set. And so we'll have to see.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">The assets are down 2% quarter-over-quarter. What's happening there? And should we extrapolate that downsizing the balance sheet?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Nothing -- there's nothing meaningful in that. I wouldn't read anything into that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">The buybacks. You certainly got some great prices during the year, but you wind up buying back 8% of your stock but shares only declined by 5%. Is there any way to narrow that gap?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">No. But I think if you want to go through sort of the mechanics of share count, I'm happy to have Dan and the team follow up with you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And then compensation. This is lower than last year, if you look at the entire year. How should we think about the comp ratio? I'm going to talk about the ratio, by the way. How should we think about the comp ratio going forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">So as we said earlier, we're going to evaluate compensation on a year-by-year basis, and we're going to incorporate everything that you would expect us to, which is performance of the firm most importantly, and then the competitive dynamic and all the other factors that go in. And of course, we have to get the balance right with the shareholders. So we'll evaluate it as the year progresses.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And then last question. Well, David's line was, \"Live to fight another day.\" So Harvey, we want to hear your line. But if you look at the VaR, it's down again. But you have the election over, and seems like sentiments improved in certain areas. I noticed the equity VaR is up, the other areas are down. So what's Goldman's thought process on taking risk as of today?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Right. So I wouldn't read too much into the decline in VaR because virtually all that's attributed to the decline in market volatilities and not actual positions on the desk. And in terms of deploying our capital, we feel quite confident in our ability to do that. And so -- but that VaR number is going to really be driven by client demand and activity, all else being equal. And so as we continue to see a pickup in client activity, positions may change now that may translate into lower things in the number, given offsets, et cetera. But the bulk of what you're seeing in the decline is market volatilities. It's not a reduction in risk or capital commitment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Just a clarification on that last point. The VaR is what we have to go on, it's the best indicator in your release, and you're saying we shouldn't really rely on that. Then what else can we rely on? I guess do you have an apples-to-apples VaR number that adjusts for the decline in market volatility? Or if I simply ask you the question, did you guys position yourselves for more risk absent what VaR is telling us?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Yes -- no. First of all, I wasn't saying you can't rely on the disclosure. So I want to be really clear on that. I was actually trying to give you extra information by saying the following: There are factors that go into VaR, one being the positions that we have. And then obviously, a big contributor are volatilities in the marketplace themselves. And so all I'm saying is in this particular instance, the decline was mostly attributed to a decline in volatility. It was no top-down directive, for example, to take less risk. Our risk-taking, as I said, will be reflective of the client flows and demand for capital.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Your next question is from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Eric Edmund Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Harvey, I hate to come back to the Basel I risk-weighted asset question that Glenn put out several minutes ago, but I'm afraid your answer was maybe too nuanced for me to understand. But it looks like over the past few quarters, your RWAs were in a fairly narrow range of between $430 billion, even $440 billion, and then have fallen quite significantly in this particular quarter. Can you just help me understand better why that occurred?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">So the movement there is -- I think what you're going to see there -- and we'll double confirm -- but I think what you're seeing there is probably the knock-on effect of our Basel III mitigation efforts having an impact on the ratio. You asked about Basel I, correct?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Eric Edmund Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Correct. Correct.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Yes. So it's the It's the Basel III capital efficiency efforts that are having a knock-on effect on the Basel I ratio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Your next question is from the line of Christopher Wheeler with Mediobanca.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Christopher Wheeler - Mediobanca Securities, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">A few questions, if I may. The first one relates really perhaps not just to you but to your peer group in the United States, having seen Basel III in terms of capital pushed out really till next year. Obviously, if we look at Europe, that's not really the case. There's a much closer scrutiny by the regulators, particularly, say, in Switzerland, of the Basel III ratios as they stand. And obviously, a lot of European banks continue to deleverage. I mean, do you see the opportunity to actually carry out some slates, which look pretty unattractive under Basel III but would look attractive under Basel I, while we go through this kind of -- this period of transition? Or will your regulator actually find that's something they would rather you didn't participate in?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I don't think that the pace of development, for example, of rule making, whether it's the Basel capital rules or, for example, in the U.S., much farther ahead on, derivatives and et cetera, I don't think that'll drive -- I could be wrong, by the way. I don't think that'll drive material differences in how firms compete in opportunities. I think a lot more of that is going to be driven by relative competitive position in aggregate. And so if you're well positioned in a particular business, that's how margin capitals input. But it doesn't strike me that the gap is so wide. But in some cases, we are seeing competitors, for example, in Europe, exit businesses. And there, for sure, there'll be opportunities. But I think for people that are competing and electing to stay in businesses, you work within the rule set you have and you try and bring your competitive advantage to bear.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Christopher Wheeler - Mediobanca Securities, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I see that. I suppose what I'm really thinking is that, for example, if -- as they are, a number of European banks are trying to sell securitized assets, which have very high risk weightings because they are being scrutinized slightly more closely by the market. But as I said, also by their regulators. Surely, some -- in terms of the U.S. banks, there is this opportunity to say actually, in terms of reporting, we don't have to worry about that from a short-term perspective and the ability to buy some quite attractive assets and then obviously place them out to your clients. I'm just thinking that might be actually quite an interesting opportunity for you. Or do you think it's still something that might lead to sort of some unattractive commentary in the press?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">No. I mean, look, we look at Basel III over the long term, too. And like I said, I think it's not the pace. Having said that, do I think some European banks and just many institutions around the globe have maybe been a little slower to sell assets than they might otherwise wanted to be in retrospect. And I think there's opportunities there, but those are opportunities that our clients are very focused on. And if we can be the firm that can bring the collective resources to bear to actually deliver those assets to our clients, then that's a good opportunity for us. But like I said, I'm not sure it's so much rule driven as it is situation specific.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Christopher Wheeler - Mediobanca Securities, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Okay. And then a second question. Really, it's related to what Kian asked you and, I guess, it's a rhetorical question for that reason. But can you give us any clue as to what your Basel III -- or what portion of your Basel III risk weighted assets at the moment are deployed in Investing &amp; Lending?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">No. I just can't [ph].</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Christopher Wheeler - Mediobanca Securities, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">I think that was a pretty much expected question.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Yes. But at least I paused.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Christopher Wheeler - Mediobanca Securities, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Yes, you did indeed. And just a final question really. Obviously, one of your closest competitors sheared a number of jobs in the last few days. And what was intriguing was, I think, something like a 6% reduction in their investment banking staff, but something like 15% in Asia. And I was just wondering, you obviously had another quarter where you were very tight on staff numbers. But is Asia the market you're still investing in? Or is it one where maybe you're also thinking, \"Have we perhaps overlicked the pudding at this stage,\" and we need to also look at our staffing there, as you obviously are in the developed markets?</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">No. As we look at it today, we think the growth markets broadly, and Asia specifically, look quite attractive. And we're comfortable with our level of investment. Having said that, again -- I'll caveat that. And of course, if the world got much brighter or turned the other way, then we'd adjust. But we feel pretty comfortable.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">And at this time, gentlemen, there are no further questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Dane Holmes</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Great. I'd like to thank everybody for joining us for our fourth quarter 2012 conference call. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us in the Investor Relations group. And otherwise, have a nice day.</p>", "<p class=\"p p19\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p19\">Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call.

I\u2019d like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question-and-answer period. (Operator Instructions) Also, this call is being recorded today, April 16, 2013. Thank you. Mr. Holmes, you may now begin your conference.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Dane Holmes</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Director of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. Today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm\u2019s belief regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain and outside of the firm\u2019s control. The firm\u2019s actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm\u2019s future results, please see the description of risk factors in our current annual report on Form 10-K for our year ended December 2012.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets and Global Core Excess. And you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that is posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com. This audiocast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Our Chief Financial Officer, Harvey Schwartz will now review the firm\u2019s results. Harvey?</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thanks, Dane, and thanks everyone for dialing in today. I will walk you through our first quarter results and then take your questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Net revenues were $10.1 billion, net earnings $2.3 billion, earnings per diluted share were $4.29 and our annualized return on common equity was 12.4%. Overall, a solid result. As we\u2019ve talked about in the past, client activity levels are generally correlated to the broader macroeconomic environment. This certainly proved to be true in the first quarter as activity levels were mixed as the quarter progress. Early in the quarter, continued positive development from U.S. economy, specifically in housing and unemployment drove increased client activity and greater risk appetite. In January U.S. new home sales grew by almost 15% month-over-month, one of the largest month-over-month increases in the last two decades.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">The U.S. nonfarm payroll report for February came in significantly higher than expectations with 236,000 jobs created versus expectations of a 160,000. In addition to driving increased client activity and risk appetite, these economic developments help support driving asset values. Most notably the S&amp;P 500 was up by 10% and key credit indices, such as the LCDX and high yield CDX reached higher by more than 50 basis points. This created a back drop to generally improve liquidity and a more favorable environment managing client flows.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">However, later in the quarter, market sentiment was mixed at political uncertainty in Europe and U.S. began to resurface. The Italian election and the situation in Cyprus added further complexity to the European outlook. Specifically its events like these that create uncertainty for market participants who struggle to understand the mechanism and approach for resolving sovereign issues within the Eurozone. Likewise in the U.S., our clients' focused on the potential negative impact to sequestration and the continued impacts related to budget negotiations.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">In aggregate, as the quarter progressed, these concerns impacted both client activity and risk appetite. Client activity levels were mixed across our investment banking businesses during the quarter. Debt underwriting activity continued at the robust pace we experienced in the fourth quarter as corporate issuers took advantage of the low interest rate environment and strong investor demand.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Equity underwriting activity improved sequentially with higher issuance activity, but is still relatively muted by historic standards. And announced M&amp;A volumes were down 37% sequentially. Macroeconomic uncertainty has been an understandable and consistent theme following the onset of the financial crisis and had quite naturally led many of our clients to approach strategic decisions with greater caution, as CEO confidence is such an important input to M&amp;A and IPO activity, continued improvement in the macro environment will be a key driver of opportunity in these businesses. Regardless of the macro uncertainty, our people remain focused on serving our clients by providing them with superior advice and execution and of course the capital necessarily to meet their goals.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">I'll now run through each of our businesses. Investment Banking produced first quarter net revenues of 1.6 billion, up 12% from the fourth quarter. First quarter advisory revenues were 484 million, down 5% sequentially. Year-to-date, Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide completed M&amp;A. We advised on a number of important transactions that closed in the first quarter, including the 21 billion Swedish Krona sale of Ahold stake in ICA to Hakon Invest. The $3.3 billion sale of select SuperValu assets to an investor group led by Cerberus Capital Management, and the $2.4 billion sale on McGraw-Hill Education to Apollo.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We're also an advisor on a number of significant announced transactions. These include the $23.3 billion sale of Virgin Media to Liberty Global, the $6.7 billion sale of Repsol's liquefied natural gas assets to Royal Dutch Shell, and the $2.6 billion acquisition by Orix Corporation of a 90% equity stake in Robeco Group. First quarter underwriting net revenues were 1.1 billion, up 21% sequentially, a record debt underwriting quarter with revenues up 17% to 694 million. In particular, this reflects significantly higher net revenues from leverage finance and commercial mortgage-related activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Equity underwriting revenues of 390 million were up 28% from the fourth quarter, reflecting an increase in IPO activity and secondary offerings. Year-to-date, Goldman Sachs ranked first in global equity and equity-related common stock offerings and IPOs. During the first quarter, there were several noteworthy transactions. Sinopec's 3.1 billion private placement ArcelorMittal\u2019s $4 billion dual-tranche equity and mandatory convertible offering, and Intelsat\u2019s  $3.5 billion high yield offering. Our Investment Banking backlog declined modestly from year-end levels.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Let me now turn to institutional client services. Total net revenues were 5.1 billion in the first quarter. These businesses produced stronger results in the seasonally weak fourth quarter, driven by an overall improvement in activity levels and market sentiment. FICC Client Execution net revenues were 3.2 billion in the first quarter, significantly better than the fourth quarter. This quarter's results reflected a broad contribution across businesses. Rates reflected generally higher activity levels as clients reacted to the improved economic outlook at the beginning of the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Our credit business experienced solid client activity and a favorable market environment with strong issuance trends and generally tighter credit spreads. Mortgages continued to benefit from strong client demand, relatively limited new supply, and improving prices. Our currency business reflected higher levels of client activity. And finally commodity results improved from what was a relatively weak fourth quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to equities, net revenues for the first quarter were $1.9 billion. Excluding the $500 million gain from the sale of our hedge fund administration business in the fourth quarter, results were up 7% quarter-over-quarter. Equities client execution revenues were 809 million, up 6% sequentially; commissions and fees were 793 million, up 10% from the fourth quarter on improved market volumes and generally higher market values in Europe and Asia. Excluding the one-time gain in the fourth quarter, security services net revenues of $320 million were roughly flat sequentially. With respect to risk, average daily VaR in the first quarter was $76 million, consistent with fourth quarter levels.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Let me now review Investing &amp; Lending. We produced net revenues of $2.1 billion in the first quarter. Investing &amp; Lending includes direct investing, investing we do through funds, as well as lending activities. These activities occur across a diversified set of asset classes including both equity and debt. Other equity investments generated net revenues of $1.1 billion, primarily reflecting gains from private equity investments.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">This strong performance reflects higher global equity prices during the quarter as well as increases in fair value driven by company specific events. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $566 million, driven by continued tightening of credit spreads as well as interest income. Our investment in ICBC produced a $24 million gain in the quarter, other revenues of $375 million were driven by the firm\u2019s consolidated investment entities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Switching over to investment management, we reported first quarter net revenues of $1.3 billion, down 13% from the fourth quarter due to lower incentive fees. Management and other fees were consistent with the fourth quarter at $1.1 billion. During the first quarter, assets under supervision increased $3 billion to $968 billion, primarily reflecting net market appreciation and net inflows in both fixed income and equity assets, partially offset by outflows and money market assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior-year equity awards, and other items such as payroll  taxes and benefits was accrued at a compensation  to net revenue ratio of 43%, which is a 100 basis points lower than the firm\u2019s accrual  in the first quarter of 2011 and 2012. Over the past two years, we\u2019ve focused extensively on cost reduction and efficiency efforts.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">From the headcount perspective, total staff at the end of the first quarter was approximately $32,000, down 1% from the end of 2012 and 10% from year-end 2010. First quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.4 billion, significantly lower than the fourth quarter due largely to lower other expenses. In the fourth quarter, other expenses included higher litigation and regulatory expenses and higher charitable contributions. Non-comp expenses was essentially unchanged from the first quarter of 2012, and our effective tax rate was 33% for the first quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">In terms of capital, there are a number of items to cover with you. During the quarter, we repurchased 10.1 million shares of common stock for a total cost of $1.5 billion. These repurchases reflected the completion of our 2012 capital plan. We also recently amended the terms of our warrant agreement with Berkshire Hathaway to acquire  net share settlement on October 1<sup>st</sup> of this year. At the end of the first quarter, our Basel 1 Tier 1 common ratio was approximately 12.7%. This includes the revised market rich framework that became effective on January 1<sup>st</sup>. Our estimated Basel III Tier 1 common ratio was approximately 9%, of course with all the caveats that the rule has not been finalized. During the first quarter, the Federal Reserve announced that it did not object to our proposed capital actions that as required by the Federal Reserve we will resubmit our capital plan by the end of the third quarter incorporating certain enhancements to our stress test processes. We intend to work closely with the Federal Reserve to implement these enhancements.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Before I take questions, let me close with a few summary thoughts. As I mentioned earlier macro uncertainty continues to be a meaningful consideration for the global marketplace. While the environment is slowly improving, there will clearly be bumps along the way. So despite an improvement in the outlook some uncertainty remains. Another uncertainty that has occupied investor\u2019s minds is the potential impact of regulatory reform on our industry. While everyone would like clarity, it's natural for these rules to be developed over multi-year timeframes, especially given the complexity and the potentially significant ramifications for the global economy. As a firm we remain a constructive participant in these discussions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">We understand the importance of creating a safe financial system while meeting our client needs and supporting global economic growth at the same time. In light of the continued macro uncertainty, we\u2019ve continued to stay focused on managing the firms risk exposures, capital usage and our expense base. It has allowed our people to be principally focused on serving our clients. We believe the combination of our operating discipline and our steady investment in our client franchise has us well positioned competitively. In addition, it has provided the firm with the opportunity to generate significant operating leverage as the environment improves.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Regardless of the operating environment, we will continue to rely on the strength of our client relationships, the diversity of our businesses, the caliber of our people, and the adaptability embedded in our culture to deliver superior results for our shareholders.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">With that, I'd like to thank you again for listening today, and I'm now happy to take your questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p4\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">(Operator Instructions). Your first question is from the line of Howard Chen with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Hello.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Hello, yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Hi, Harvey. I was hoping to get your takeaways on the 2013 CCAR now that it's all set and  done, there was some disparity on the PPNR and stress ratios between you and the Fed, and I was just wondering how that impacts your view on capital planning or running that process internally if it does at all?</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">So when we think about capital planning, obviously first and foremost Howard, we think about making sure that we strike that careful balance between making sure that we have capital from a defensive  perspective, but also we want it to be positioned for the opportunities for our clients, and we manage that process obviously dynamically as we go through. Specifically with respect to the CCAR, what I would say is we don't have visibility into their numbers. So, I really can't comment to any extent on the differences between our submission. I know when we go through our submission, we think about the event and we approach it from a very conservative framework. Did I answer your question, Howard?</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Okay. And we'll move on to the next question. It's from the line of Glenn Schorr with Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Hi. How are you?</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Fine, Glenn. How are you?</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">All right. Curious with the market up so much and sluggish revenue backdrop across the industries and everything that we know about balance sheet and cheap debt, normally this would be a pretty good world for M&amp;A, but of course there are some bigger overhangs out there. I'm just curious to see what you're seeing? You made a comment about pipelines, but as a general comment as you look out the next year plus why don't we have a better M&amp;A backdrop? I mean that backdrop is good, why isn't there better M&amp;A activity?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So, I think and I highlighted in my prepared remarks, I really think it's a question of we're very close still to the epicenter of the crisis at least in the context of history, right? And so people's memories are very fresh. And when you have periods of uncertainty, as I said bumps along the way, like events in Europe or big shifts in employment data and economic growth, it doesn't translate well when you think about CEOs who are making what obviously is the most significant decision they're making for the organization strategically. And so, I think it's going to be a bit of a lagging indicator, because it will be one of those things that when we really have stability and confidence, you'll start to see it come out of the pipeline. Having said that, obviously we feel really good about our position competitively in our M&amp;A franchise, and it really is just a question of when activity picks up.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">But I wish I could tell you when.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">I hear you. Investing &amp; Lending, is there anything you can tell us in terms of much realized this quarter, I mean markets were up huge, so I would imagine that there were some gains along the way, but a lot of that is marks?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">It really was in line with broad equity markets, so in the past, we have pointed you to the MSCI, and so there are going to be periods where we obviously outperform that because of the idiosyncratic nature of the portfolio on periods where we underperformed, but more or less in line.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">And you still -- there's a decent private component to it, so I'm assuming that there's still some big liquidity discounts used on the private positions?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">I don't know that I'd say -- I do want to be careful about the word liquidity discounts. What I'd say that we're, as you would expect us to be very thorough in terms of how we mark the portfolio and as well as our orders, so yeah, these things will be in line with the market as appropriate.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Understood. And then in commodities, I get the component of the business that would be weak due to just trending lower prices and less structured transactions. Is there anything on the regulatory front that\u2019s changing how you do business, how you think about the business going forward, or is it strictly a cyclical phenomenon  right now closing the weakness?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">No, there is nothing on the regulatory environment that\u2019s impacting the way we think about the business, specifically no, of course there are lot of rules to come, and so we will get more visibility in commodities and other businesses could be impacted as we see \u2013 as we get more transparency, but there is nothing in the regulatory aspects of it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Okay, excellent. Thank you, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Your next question is from the line of Roger Freeman with Barclays. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Roger Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Hi. Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Hey, Roger.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Roger Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Hi. The Volcker Rule presumably getting pushed out further, I guess, latest reports are not until sometime during the second half. How do you view that good or bad being the uncertainty lasts longer good as potentially better outcome?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">I think in the end, it\u2019s all about quality rule making process. These are \u2013 and it\u2019s not just Volcker, these are exceptionally complex rules. So, these are obviously incredibly critical, not just with the financial institutions that will limit the rules, but really quite frankly more broadly in terms of their impact on the capital markets, and given the complexity, I think it\u2019s quite natural that these are going to take time to implement. And the regulators themselves -- it\u2019s a massive amount of work that they have to go through to get to a place to introduce these rules. So, I think this process in terms of the time it\u2019s taking, I think we would love to \u2013 I think everyone would like to have the final rule set in front of us, clients would certainly want that, we would want that, our constituents would want that, but I think it\u2019s very natural and on balance, I think if it improves the quality of the rule making, which to-date is what we\u2019ve seen for example in clearing, I think it\u2019s a good thing on balance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Roger Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay. And that BDC you\u2019re setting up, is that in anyway tied to sort of you or the regulatory outcome. It seems like that might be investing in things that SSG does?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">No; not at all. That\u2019s very much just part of our asset management strategy where we\u2019re managing assets on behalf of our clients as a fiduciary. We obviously have asset core competence in there, credit risk management skills, so no this -- that has nothing to do with Volcker.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Roger Freeman \u2013 Barclays Capital, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay. And one another on the reg front, the -- I guess the first phase of the mandatory clearing has been effective over a  month or so now, any comment on how that -- how that\u2019s going, and specifically anything or you can identify on activity levels like rate and CDS that\u2019s sort of separate from broader market impact?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">No, as you know -- and we talked about this a lot in the past, we\u2019re huge proponents of clearing, and obviously that comes with the caveat, the obvious caveat that as long as it is done safely, but in terms of as a mitigant to systemic risk, we think it ranks quite highly, and so we\u2019ve been a huge proponent of it. I think just getting back to the earlier question, I think in terms of things that were delayed, I actually think the delay here was quite thoughtful, and I think the CFTC in their rollout plan by having the first rollout in March, a second wave in June. I mean that\u2019s a very constructive way to approach the market because it gives clients an opportunity particularly the second wave appliance not the most frequent users an opportunity to adjust. And they have a lot of work to do. There are work flow issues, processes et cetera that go into this, and so I think it's been thoughtful. With respect to impact on business activity et cetera, I do think this is one of these things that as we gain more clarity, it definitely provides people the rules that they can operate in, they\u2019re more willing to engage, but it's way too early to measure the impact.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Roger Freeman \u2013 Barclays Capital, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay, just lastly inventory levels across FICC, I think they were higher in the first quarter. Did they end at around the average of the quarter, any sort of kind of trends coming into this 2Q?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">I didn\u2019t hear the very first part of what you said. Did you say, is it inventory or activity?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Roger Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">No, inventory levels.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">No, no big trends. Nothing meaningful in terms of inventory.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Roger Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay. All right, thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Thanks, Roger.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay. Thanks. Just on the OTC side, you've just given out we're starting down that process. If you think about the different users in the market, so like corporates, pensions, asset managers, hedge funds and if you look at the increased margin requirement, when they're thinking about alternatives, meaning using a future versus an OTC contract, is there something that Goldman or the deals, particularly on that margin, are disadvantaged? Is there something that you can provide to make that less of an issue, so maybe like on the collateral management side, just trying to figure out because it seems like there's going to be some users that there will be more incentive to try to use an alternative if they don't have the hurdles like hedge accounting, but I don't know if on the dealer side if there's something that you can provide to kind of ease that burden?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Yeah, I think that when -- first of all, I would say the following. We in the industry have lived with uneven requirements in terms of whether its margin or a capital standard and so some of these things are going to run like this. I think as we get the full view of everything that's out there, I think that the regulatory community and all of our as participants will then have to view the extent of which there's differences and understand whether or not those incentives are actually the right incentives in terms of reducing systemic risks because remember, the overarching objective here is to reduce systemic risks and that's again I'd go back to my earlier comment about clearing. So you don't necessarily want to have significantly different collateral requirements for essentially the same type of risks, because then you can get some unwanted incentives. Now having said and putting that aside for a moment, our clients are driven by the long-term incentive goal so they're going to make the best choice they can for executing and at times, collateral maybe a more significant component of their thought process; other times other issues will guide how they execute.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay, makes sense. And then just on the market share opportunity, there's a lot of stuff that's shifting around whether it's the increased cost or regulation on the fixed income side, you guide different roles on comp coming out of Europe, maybe foreign entities in the U.S. having different capital requirements going forward. When you got to size up just given the competitive landscape in the different product areas, how much market share opportunity do you think is kind of shifting around and potentially up for grabs over the next, call it one to two years?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So it's a great question. It's a difficult thing to quantify. And so strategically the way we approach it is making sure that, and let's just take for example the security division, if you think about the diverse nature of that business, what you really need to be successful in terms of having scale, but awesome ability to deliver the full range of services to your clients, so whether it's commodities or interest rates or prime brokerage, executing blocks of equities. So furthermore you need to be at scale in this market environment because trying to build I think the headwinds are hard given the activity levels we feel like we are at scale and feel quite good about our position both within those individual businesses but of course geographically also. So I'll have to see over the next several years, but it feels like there's reasonable market share opportunity given the environment, because as I said that's leader in some of these businesses, I think it's a difficult time to build.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay, all right. Thanks a lot.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Hi, good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Hi, Betsy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">A couple of questions. One on the reinsurance business, you broke that out which is helpful. Just wanted to understand what kind of impact that has on capital relief when that deal closes?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So in the insurance business, we're in the midst of the sale process. So if it's okay, Betsy, I will come back to you with that when the sale process closes. However, as we go through the new capital rules, the driver here was as I mentioned earlier, the amount of capital that business attracts under the new rule set. And so we like that business, but under new capital rules its really better held in other people\u2019s hands and so it just felt like it was appropriate to move forward the sales process, but as it completes we will certainly update you with more info.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. And then you\u2019ve in the past outlined opportunities for active and passive RWA mitigation, is there any changes at all to the outlook over the next year or two?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">No, there are no changes in the outlook. Obviously, we continue to focus on it very closely and I talked about the tools that we\u2019ve been rolling out, that will continues on schedule. So we just continue to work through the process.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. Because it just looks like maybe there wasn\u2019t as much this past quarter is in average what you suggested. Is that fair or \u2026?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">No, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say that, but I think it \u2013 I think its hard to look at it in a quarter-over-quarter period. I think we\u2019ve to look at over longer periods, but we\u2019re comfortable with our progress.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Sure. Okay. And do you give details just on numerator-denominator on the Basel III, the RWAs for example?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">No, we\u2019ve not.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Good morning. Its like a follow-up with a couple of questions on the commodities business, there was a blurb last week that you might be selling the metals warehousing unit, I was just wondering if there was any comment you could provide on that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">No, we have no comment, although the only thing I would say that, I don\u2019t want those things come out and they\u2019re picked up in the press, they often have not knock on question that relate to our commitment to commodities or anything like (inaudible) we got into that business in 1981 and have invested a huge amount in being a market leader, so we\u2019re very committed to that business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And then just related to just commodities pricing that we\u2019ve seen in the last couple of days, obviously a lot of volatility and maybe its too early to know, but is this potentially good for the business because maybe volumes increase or bad because there was just too much volatility or again maybe too early to know.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Well, its definitely too early, but it's really a question of degree of volatility and causes. I think some of the volatility we have seen particularly in commodities it looks more like liquidation of crowded positions. So, I wouldn\u2019t read too much into it. And in all the time investors will digest the information and then that will translate these either into expanded client activity or not. But I think in the near term the action is what I said, mostly liquidation.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. And then just separately some other firms have talked about structured products being a little bit better in 1Q and I would assume that\u2019s somewhat broad based, but any thoughts on what's driving that, is it just as clients look for yield or optimism over the economy or a combination of both?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yeah, I can\u2019t comment on anything else, any of what the competitor said. What I would say is that and you certainly see it in terms of yield activity and it was reflected in the quarter in respect to both issuers -- the opportunity issuers have to issue and obviously investor appetite as people search for yield.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I guess any thoughts on, I mean rates have been so low for so long and obviously this is broadly an area that\u2019s been fairly quite and it seemed to pick up quite a bit at 1Q so it just seems like rates have been low for a while and it was a combination of that in the economy or?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Well there\u2019s certainly, there\u2019s certainly a cycle of reinvestment that\u2019s occurring. I think back to last year a capital committee we were reviewing financing opportunities for our clients, committing capital, bringing things to market and many often \u2013 many times those same clients were back six to nine months later in a position to refinance because of the compression of credit spread and the market appetite. But if you\u2019re asking me when that will change, that\u2019s a question I definitely don\u2019t ever view on and I can guarantee I\u2019ll do wrong.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay. Thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hi, Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hi. So your prior ROE target was 20%. You haven't given a new target I don't know. You were 12% this quarter. Can you just give us some sense what sort of ROE you guys would hope to have over several years?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So with respect to the ROE, it's an important question Mike and we still don't have enough information in terms of capital rules, all the regulatory activity to give you a view. What I will tell you is that we remain very focused on our returns, both on our relative and absolute basis and certainly in the way that we're deploying and managing the balance sheet.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And you said your Basel III tier and common ratio was about 9%. With your passive strategies if they were all done today, what would that 9% ratio be?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">We haven't updated that, Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. And I guess -- I won't get an answer to the active strategies either. I'm just trying to figure out how much potential there is with both the passive and the active strategies for managing the risks with the assets to create a whole lot more capital, because it seems like you're willing to buyback a lot of stock here. You bought an average price of $150, the stocks below there, so why not be even more aggressive I guess?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Well, with respect to capital, first of all, in terms of the ratio, you're going to see the work as we do it. So we want to present it to you. I'm sure there's a whole lot of value for guessing it. In terms of how we think about share repurchase and how managing the capital dynamically from quarter-to-quarter, we're going to make adjustments as we work through. And so if we think the best use of our capital is to return it, we'll do that. And if we think it's best to deploy in the business, we'll do that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And then just lastly a separate question. In terms of rightsizing the business, how do you know if you've downsized too much you or your competition? Some are cutting a lot more than others and how do you know what's the right amount when you've cut too much?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Right. So that's a great question because if you look back over the past two years, in some respects if you knew you were going to end up down 10% in headcount, you would have rather done that on day one rather than take two years to do it, okay. We don't have a crystal ball. This is a really important strategic point about how we have to think about the business. First and foremost, we need to be there for our clients in all aspects of our business; Investment Banking, Asset Management, Securities Division. And so we can't shape the opportunities, instead we can only shape how we respond and compete with other market participants. And so we're constantly reviewing it and that's why you've seen us take the steps that you've seen us take. Right now for the current environment, we feel quite comfortable. If the opportunities had expanded and the environment can improve, you could see us deploying more resources and likewise. If the environment was to trend downward, I think you'd see us responding there too of course.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">All right. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Thanks, Mike.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research LLP</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Good morning. So I'm looking at your FICC revenues, if I adjust them for DDA year-over-year and I look at the percentage change. You're down about 9% and the couple of big peers that have reported so far are also down but more like mid-single digits. You've identified the drag on the year-over-year comparison as being rate products, but I would expect that some of those other guys who are more sort of big banks would have been maybe more by that just based on mix. Are we still seeing a process of [assessment] to your business mix towards the new regulatory realities and can you comment maybe on the revenue mix between cash and derivative instruments on a year-over-year basis?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Those quarter-over-quarter numbers we don't view those as a big deal. There is -- I don't think there's a lot of information in there. If the numbers were completely reversed, I wouldn't be pointing -- I wouldn't be pointing you to that as a material item. There's going to be noise in the numbers back and forth and we feel quite comfortable with the position of our FICC business. But again just a problem that a little bit, you talked before about the opportunity relative to the some of the issues that a lot of the European banks are facing and I believe that Goldman Sachs should be able to actually benefit pretty meaningfully from some of that. Is that something that we\u2019re going to see longer term and again I\u2019m going to come back to this idea that given that you\u2019re seeing some change in the regulatory environment because of the change in OTC protocols and everything else, are you making changes to your business in the short-term debt or that are driving short-term revenue contraction and preparing yourself for some of these market share opportunities longer term or is there is something else that I\u2019m kind of missing here, as I tried out to figure out what\u2019s going on?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yeah, so \u2013 okay, it is a very important question, so I want to make sure I\u2019m clear on that. So, in terms of again the quarter-over-quarter I don\u2019t think there is a lot of read through for you there. I think in terms of the opportunities that as it relates to the \u2013 to regulatory issues, really difficult to speculate on for example the impact of clearing swap execution facilities we don\u2019t have yet and many of the rules are still outstanding. If you ask me I think as you get more clarity rule set, clients respond well to that. Now with respect to how we adjust, this is the strategic issue. You can \u2013 and I covered this, I don\u2019t know, if you saw I covered this a bit at the Credit Suisse conference back in February, but one of the things that we\u2019ve found is that trying to anticipate rules can be quite costly and you can make major mistakes. The mortgage business being a really concrete example of when you first saw the Notice for Proposed Rulemaking for mortgages a couple of years ago versus responding to final rules. So, you\u2019re not seeing us dial down or up our businesses in anticipation of rules. With respect to market share opportunities, those are all always in my experience multi-year events and they will play out over time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research LLP</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. That\u2019s actually very helpful. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question is from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Matthew Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Good morning, just a couple of I guess relatively quick questions. We\u2019ve heard from a couple of your competitors that the client activity levels over the course of the first quarter was sort of strongest in the first -- earlier part of the quarter, weakest or absent in March. I guess I\u2019m curious given that your assets were up about 11% quarter-over-quarter, but borrow was stable. Can you give us a sense as to sort of what your activity levels were over the course of the quarter and what the level of I guess, conversations were in the advisory businesses over the course of the quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So client activity as I said in my prepared remarks was \u2013 it was more active really in the first month of the quarter and then it slowed down a bit in March based on just the data that came through. And what we have seen is that clients whether it's in the advisory business or those on the investing side are obviously very sensitive to data and information. And so for example as issues started to come back more on to front screens as it relates to issues in Europe, clients obviously pulled back towards the end of the quarter. But I would say that overall the trend in terms of outlook feels like it's continuing to improve steady, but it's not going to be a straight line from here to there and so our strategy during this time period obviously is to stay extremely focused on our clients. It is an environment where there is, you can really compete on content with your clients because there is uncertainty that you\u2019re dealing with.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Matthew Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Right. And then just back on a quick question on I&amp;L, can you \u2013 given the strong performance of the markets in the quarter, did that incent you to potentially accelerate a bit of your realizations in the first quarter given the strong performance of the markets or was that pretty much at steady state?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">It's always going to be a function of the market and idiosyncratic events, and obviously I said there was a correlation. But there aren\u2019t things \u2013 we don\u2019t look opportunistically and the market will give us opportunities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Matthew Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And I guess just back to VaR, given the volatility in the market of Cypress in March, did that have a meaningful impact on VaR over the course of the quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">No. With respect to VaR over the quarter, it was virtually unchanged from the fourth quarter\u2026</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Matthew Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Right.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Well, you see a bigger drop is from first quarter last year to this year, but that's virtually all driven by market volatilities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Matthew Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So a question on the competition for talent here and maybe potential impact on expense flexibility. Could you give us some color on what you're seeing so far and maybe where you guys trying to signal something in that regard with the moderate drop in comp ratio? I know where you guys peg it in the first nine months, it almost turns out to be arbitrary given how big the fourth quarter delta is, but was that something you were trying to get across?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">No. In terms of talent, quite frankly it feels like one of the better market environments we've seen in quite a long time. Our ability to acquire and add people to our team seems pretty good. And in terms of attrition, attrition is very manageable. And it's not reflected at all in how we think about the competition ratio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. And then a follow-up on Howard's question. Is there any color you can give on the resubmission process, how those discussions are going with the Fed? Maybe any granular specifics about what drove that request and such?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So we don't have any color yet and to the extent which we can share it over time, we will. Of course, it's supervisory level data but whatever we can share over time, we will. What I will say is that as a firm that invested a lot of time and energy both in terms of analytics but culturally around risk, we always look for opportunities to learn. And so we'll work closely with the Fed or with the Federal Reserve over the next six months. And we look forward to enhancing any process changes we make.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. And I guess following up on that the idea of learning is we're going through this. Given that we now are starting to see the impact of the stress test as we move closer to Basel III and some of these rules start getting implemented and included in stress test, do you continue to think that firms with large comps or global investment banks running with about a 10% tier 1 common ratio is realistic, or do you think that it might end up working out higher than that given how the stress test process has been going so far?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I think it's too early to tell and I do think -- but what I will say is the stress test is a really good concept and quite frankly it there was a version on the stress test prior to the crisis, maybe it would have had some mitigating effects in terms of the crisis. But it's evolutionary and it's complex, and so we'll have to see how it evolves.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. And then last one from me is just sort of a net question. Incentive comp in investment management stood out as pretty high particularly given it's the first quarter. Was there anything specific behind that or were it just the strong markets?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">No, I think you're referring, sorry, just to incentive fees\u2026</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yup.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">No, there was\u2026.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">I'm sorry, yeah, incentive fees.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yeah, I'm sorry, it's okay. No, nothing specific to highlight for you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay. Thanks a lot.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question is from the line of Christopher Wheeler with Mediobanca. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Christopher Wheeler - Mediobanca Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yes, good morning. Three questions if I may. The first one is on the VaR, just interested in the increase in the currency and rates. Obviously -- and anyway you don't normally see too much movement, but you seemed to have seen the increase there. Perhaps give us some background on that? Second question is on revenue mix. I think 59% of the revenues last year in the United States, I wondered if you could give us a flavor for whether that has changed much in the first quarter, given obviously how rather more vast the U.S. markets were? And then finally just to follow-up really on that question on the realizations in I&amp;L on equities, because I think you had about 120 billion of Basel III [RWA] in the end of the year and I wondered had that moved a great deal on the back of the gains you've made, and really what sort of progress you want to make on that over the next 12 months? Thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. So, let me make sure, I rattle through those. So, on VaR, so as you know, VaR is measured with a lag. Our VaR I think relative to competitive reason we\u2019re heavily weighted to the more recent observable time period, so about 50% of the contribution. But there is nothing meaningful in those shifts and they reflect generally speaking client activity and obviously the result in position. So there is nothing meaningful about VaR. The more \u2013 I think more significant observation that everybody should take away with the one I made with respect to last year versus this year, and that as market volatility is increased I think you can easily see increasing VaR over time, but perhaps with the same position profile. So people shouldn\u2019t be \u2013 we\u2019re certainly not lulled into any complacency as a result of the fact that the VaR signal is low because that\u2019s mostly driven by market volatilities. With respect to your second question on business mix, its nothing significant we would highlight for you there obviously as you would expect activity in Europe towards the end of the quarter a little more impact, a little more impacted but it really just natural outcome of client activity. And so where you see uncertainty, client activity obviously is going to be impacted. But I wouldn\u2019t say that the mix is used materially. When you asked a question on I&amp;L, your last question \u2026</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Christopher Wheeler - Mediobanca Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yeah.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">\u2026 you had \u2013 I think also a question on I&amp;L, we\u2019re going to continue to manage that business as we have in the past and so that is obviously about investment selection, but that includes obviously the lending activities, the debt and equity, so it\u2019s a diversified portfolio, its diversified geographically and so, we will continue to manage that business we have in the past. So nothing really to comment there.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Christopher Wheeler - Mediobanca Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Thank you very much. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Sure.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question is from the line of Douglas Sipkin with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yeah, hi, good morning. Two questions. First, can you just sort of update us on the framework or thinking around capital usage at this very point, obviously you\u2019ve talked about capacity coming out of some businesses. The stock is at about $143. You have a pretty significant authorization, so any change in the philosophy there? Or is it sort of \u2013 should we be thinking about the 2012 dynamic? And then on the Asset Management side, I know \u2013 not mentioned yet, but it did look like you guys had one of your better quarters in a while with respect to some long-term flows and I\u2019m just wondering if there was anything you guys could attribute that to? Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Sure. In terms of capital no there is nothing there and with respect to -- asset management we obviously continued to stay very focused on performance and improved performance always attracts client flows and we\u2019re still missing that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So if I could just follow up at the first question I guess, when we think about repurchase activity I mean the framework for 2012 is a reasonable framework for \u201913, is that a fair statement?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I wouldn\u2019t extrapolate 2012 into 2013, because it will be based on the environment and so if we see continued improving opportunities which again will be driven by our clients then we may deploy capital into the business and it's a balance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Got you. Okay, great. Thanks a lot.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question is from the line of Fred Cannon with KBW. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Frederick Cannon - KBW</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Hi, so I just had a follow up on the BDC issue on the Liberty Harbor, I was wondering if you might be able to kind of size the opportunity there in terms of growth you mentioned it as part of kind of an asset under management and also if that\u2019s part of a broader strategy to kind of attack mid-size firms?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Well it's not a strategy to sort of be targeted against any firm. It really is just again what I said earlier about the point our compensations, the opportunities that we feel our clients are interested in and would benefit from. And so, we\u2019ll have to see how the business grows over time but of course this will be a multi-year effort. And I think it really gets to the point that we\u2019re always looking for opportunities and new products to introduce that our clients want to utilize.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Frederick Cannon - KBW</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay. And then just another \u2013 one other follow-up by, you\u2019ve addressed a lot of the issues about the U.S. regulatory environment. I was wondering if you could comment on some of the issues going on in Europe particularly the push for a financial transaction tax.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So of course we\u2019re monitoring all that and we\u2019ll engage with regulators in terms of discussion, of course it's unclear at this point exactly how this will ultimately be adopted so it's really not possible at this stage to ask me to give a little impact. I guess I would say that when evaluating any of these rules, all the market participants, obviously we all have a huge obligation, regulators and clients and ourselves to make sure that we strike the right balance because we want to make sure that we're insuring that the best capital markets are build with proper liquidity and so these are important things.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Frederick Cannon - KBW</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And then along those lines, I guess I would just kind of follow-up is, is there any sense of kind of where regulation seems to be headed to be the most ownerless, whether it's Europe or the U.S. or does it feel like it's the same kind of across the globe?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">No, I don't know if I'd say ownerless. I think I'd say that if there was a consistent pattern, I think generally speaking for the rules that have been proposed versus how they've been finalized, they generally start in one place. There's been engagement with market participants and they generally have migrated to a place that's better for the capital markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Frederick Cannon - KBW</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">All right. Thanks so much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Sure.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question is from the line of Fiona Swaffield with RBC. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Fiona Swaffield - RBC Capital Markets, LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Good morning. I just have two quick questions. One was on the issue of Basel III where I'm struggling to reconcile what's happened with the new market risk rules. It looked to me like it came in a bit better, because you talked about 350 basis points of improvements and I thought I'd see that in the [RWAs] under Basel III and I wondered if you could talk about why that's not the case? And the second issue is just if you have any comments on security services just in terms of year-on-year, there a seasonal impact or is there anything in particular you wanted to note? Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So on the second question, nothing in particular to note. The only other thing I would say with respect to the ratios, you're right, reference what we -- I think you're referring to what we put in the 10-K. And so it was in the 10-K. So obviously the performance for the quarter and also we received some feedback from the Fed despite the numbers which improved them.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Fiona Swaffield - RBC Capital Markets, LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">But then what I can't quite understand is why we didn't see that in the Basel III number because obviously it's part of the components?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">No, well, I did say approximately, so I'm not going to specific guess the number but it is improving there as well.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Fiona Swaffield - RBC Capital Markets, LLC</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question is from the line of Jeff Harte with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Jeffrey Harte - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Hi, good morning. Kind of a macro thought question thinking about the FICC revenue outlook and I guess I'm specifically thinking we've been waiting for higher margin businesses like mortgages to pick up for a while. Now that we're seeing it, we're actually kind of seeing thick decline but I had a little trouble balancing between the importance of larger what I usually think of as being lower margin businesses like rates versus the smaller of a typically much higher margin businesses like mortgages?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So as the activity picks up, obviously you're going to see it. But I think the key for us is the diversity of the franchise. And so as I said earlier, we just want to make sure strategically that -- and we're far from perfect and there's always work we can do on improving our businesses and we stay very focused on that. But we want to make sure that we're positioned within each one of the businesses where we really get the benefit in a market environment like this is the diversity both within products but also geographically.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Jeffrey Harte - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Should we kind of sitting here today be happy because we see mortgages picking up or should we be more concerned that rates are probably not going to hit the revenue levels that is did historically?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">We don't. I don't know if I'll describe it as happy or sad. I think again we have to -- we don't create the environment, we just have to make sure we're best positioned for our clients to respond to it. So for example right now as you point out and I mentioned in the earlier comment, a bit improvement in housing. There's also been investors desirous of yield and so you see things starting to turn off in terms of the mortgage business, but it may not correlate for example with the rate business which is why I highlighted the diversity aspect. It will be the case -- we don't expect necessarily very frequently all the cylinders to fire at the same time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Jeffrey Harte - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. And as we're thinking about comp expense, what should we -- and this may have been touched on but what, if anything, should we read into a year-over-year decline in the accrual ratio, despite I&amp;L actually being a smaller portion of revenues year-over-year, I mean should we be looking for continued comp expense efficiency-driven improvements going forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">No, there are no change to the way we thought about the compensation ratio this year versus prior years and just to be thorough as you know and we talked about this a lot, it's driven by performance other issues the competitive dynamic and what's happening in a broader environment and in the end it's our best estimate. Now what I would say is that certainly the expense efforts that, and the controlled efforts we put in over the past two years give us some degree of flexibility and that\u2019s represented in the number.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Jeffery Harte - Sandler O'Neill &amp; Partners</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. So your best estimate now is lower than your best estimate a year ago and can I paraphrase to say that\u2019s at least partially structurally driven, as opposed to business mix driven?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I think about it that exactly, I think that\u2019s fine.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Jeffery Harte - Sandler O'Neill &amp; Partners</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question is from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with SunTrust. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thanks. Harvey, I just wanted to return to the VaR issue. Most of my questions have already been answered, but you made a comment, I just want to make sure I understood it, which was that \u2013 that we should directionally expect the VaR dollars to increase but in a similar mix of categories. Is that correct?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So what I was trying to say was the following. So, there\u2019s obviously multiple inputs that go into the VaR calculation. One dominant factor obviously is market volatilities that we experience during the process. So, for us there\u2019s a bit more of a waiting towards the more recent time period, roughly 50% of the VaR calculation is impacted by the last three month volatilities and so when we saw what I was trying to was just draw a line under the 95% from last year, I think it was down to 76% this quarter and that is coming mostly by drop \u2013 a decline in implied volatility in the market place.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Not from position change and what I was really saying was it wouldn\u2019t surprise me at some point the volatility will increase, who knows. It could be soon, it could be a long time from now. But I also wouldn\u2019t read too much into my comment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay, so I guess the real crux of my question now is that it sounds like based on what you\u2019re seeing from client activities that this trend VaR profile would remain pretty consistent without any changes in broader volatility?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">That\u2019s too hard for me to predict, I mean if you\u2019re basically saying the second quarters were exactly the same as the first quarter it might look like that, but I think clients are going to drive activity as they always do and it's a dynamic world.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Great. Thanks very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Hi, Chris.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Christoph Kotowski - Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yeah, hi. I just wanted to see if I could pin you down on the compensation question with a little bit more specialties at the end. Should we read into that decline that the Goldman Sachs Company is dedicated to achieving positive operating leverage, in the sense that if revenues are flat to up by when we see the fourth quarter number the compensation ratio should be slightly down.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yeah, I don\u2019t want to attach too much to the compensation ratio itself. What I would think was that, you should a 100% assume that in all aspects of our business we\u2019re always looking for operating leverage. And at the same time we\u2019re making sure we find that balance between how we compete for talent, compete against our competitors in Uruguay and most importantly how we serve our clients.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Christoph Kotowski - Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Okay, fair enough. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with The Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Hi, good morning. Just one follow-up on the derivatives reform, with the May 1 deadline looming for signing up clients with for them to register for swaps trading. Do you see that as an issue in terms of activity levels? Do you think it gets extended, how do you think of \u2013 how should we think about that impact this quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So this is again one of these things that\u2019s really, really difficult to predict and so we\u2019ll monitor and -- one other things that we\u2019ve learned in terms of regulatory changes and market structure changes is that, the key is lessen our predicting effort outcomes and more about responding to them. And so we have a long history of adapting and so as these rules become [live], we're going to have to adapt as our clients. And we'll have to adapt better than our competitors. Historically, we've been good at that but we'll have to deliver in the future.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Fair enough. Maybe taking a little bit of a longer term view as you get more prepared for and moving things to clearing and increasing electronification of FICC, do you see offsets here? What's your view on how expenses react to greater electronification and should that offset, I guess, most people's view of declining revenues in that type of environment?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So again, difficult to predict so I think it's better to look at history of the guide. The electronification of FICC has been obviously happening for a number of years. You go back to early part of 2000 with the advent of trade web and government bond and then simultaneously the foreign exchange markets. So, electronification is not new to us, even FICC and obviously equities broadly. And so it's for us, the electronification I think is a bit of a muscle memory issue and of course as you know, we think we have some competitive advantage given than we have one platform in (inaudible) which when will it become final and as markets become more electronic, a lot of this is about speed and ability to adopt new procedures and respond because that's what our clients need. And so with respect to the forward, obviously there's some operating efficiencies that can be gained. You may get new revenue development and new products, but I think those things are much harder to forecast. You really have to look at our experience in terms of how we're done it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So I guess if we look at equities, it did seem like you had following more electronic, moved to commission you had less volatility and better returns. Do you think that that's a logical outcome for fixed income as well?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Again, like I said, I think if you look at the case study and we didn't -- and Dane I think can walk you through more specific examples offline. But if you look just at us, case study of equities, foreign exchange, government bond trading, et cetera, I think our history is good but we have to execute.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay, fair enough. Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">At this time, there are no further questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Dane E. Holmes</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Great. This is Dane Holmes. I'd like to thank all of you for joining us for our first quarter earnings conference call.

I\u2019d like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question-and-answer period. (Operator Instructions) Also this call is being recorded today, July 16, 2013. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Mr. Holmes, you may now begin your conference.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Dane E. Holmes</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. Today\u2019s call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm\u2019s belief regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain and outside of the firm\u2019s control. The firm\u2019s actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm\u2019s future results, please see the description of risk factors in our current annual report on Form 10-K for our year ended December 2012.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">I\u2019d also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly, as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets and Global Core Excess. And you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures and regulatory capital ratios that are posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com. This audiocast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Our Chief Financial Officer, Harvey Schwartz will now review the firm\u2019s results. Harvey?</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thanks, Dane, and thanks everyone for dialing in today. I\u2019ll walk you through our second quarter results and then take your questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Net revenues were $8.6 billion, net earnings $1.9 billion, earnings per diluted share $3.70, our annualized return on common equity 10.5%. For the first half of the year our return on common equity was 11.5%. All in, a solid outcome and what continues to be a dynamic market environment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">On our earnings call last quarter, we discussed how the evolving economic outlook impacts client activity. Narrowing economic data and substantial central bank actions during the quarter caused our clients to continually reassess their expectations from global growth. As a result, our clients risk appetite in activity levels fluctuated over the course of the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">At the beginning of the quarter, our clients remained focused on the European economic outlook. As the quarter progressed, solid economic data out of the U.S. began to moderate economic concerns. Client activity, risk appetite, and asset prices improved as a result of the increased confidence in the U.S. economy. Macro concerns emerged again towards the end of the quarter and refracted \u2013 reflected in lower activity levels and risk appetite in certain businesses. In addition, the market volatility created more challenging periods within the capital markets for managing client flows.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">As I previously mentioned, central banks around the world were particularly active during the second quarter. This activity was a key driver of market sentiments during the quarter. In Japan, the Central Bank undertook unprecedented monetary action to stimulate their economy. During the second quarter, the yen declined by approximately 5% versus the U.S. dollar and 7% versus the euro.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">The marketplace tried to weigh the potential near-term benefits for the Japanese economy against the relative headwinds for other parts of the world. In the U.S., commentary from the Federal Reserve about potentially tapering its bond buying program led to a significant rise in interest rates. Market participants continue to debate the timing and impact of tapering on both the market and economic activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Clients were also concerned with the potential slow down in China during the quarter. Ultimately our clients are assessing the broader global economy, specifically whether a recovering U.S., will offset potentially slower growth in other economic regions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">I\u2019ll now run through each of our businesses. Investment banking produced second quarter net revenues of $1.6 billion, roughly consistent with the first quarter. Second quarter advisory revenues were $486 million, consistent with the first quarter. Year-to-date, Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced and completed M&amp;A. We advised on a number of important transactions that closed in the second quarter, including News Corporation approximately $9 billion spin-off of its publishing business. Hess\u2019s 2.1 billion sale of its Russian subsidiary to Lukoil and Siemens 1.7 billion British pound acquisition of Invensys Rail.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We are also an advisor on a number of significant announced transactions. They include Canada Safeway\u2019s CAD$5.8 billion sale to Sobeys. Springer Science and Business Media\u2019s \u20ac3.3 billion sale to BC Partners and Lender Processing Services $4 billion sale to Fidelity National Financial.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Second quarter underwriting net revenues were $1.1 billion, relatively consistent with a robust first quarter. Debt underwriting revenues were very strong at $695 million and represents a record quarter. While the pace of commercial mortgage related activity slowed, leverage finance activity remains strong. Equity underwriting revenues of $371 million were down 5% compared with the first quarter. Year-to-date, Goldman Sachs ranked first in global equity and equity-related common stock offerings and IPOs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">During the second quarter, there were several noteworthy transactions. Apple\u2019s $17 billion first ever debt offering. Valeant Pharmaceuticals $9.6 billion debt and equity financing and J.C. Penney\u2019s $2.3 billion term loan. Our Investment Banking backlog was consistent with first quarter levels.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Let me now turn to institutional client services. Total net revenues were $4.3 billion in the second quarter. FICC Client Execution net revenues were $2.5 billion in the second quarter, lower than the first quarter, but higher than the second quarter a year-ago. This quarter results continue to reflect a broad contribution across businesses and reinforce the benefits of having a diversified franchise.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">While activity levels in our currency business remains strong as clients reacted to increased volatility, particularly in Asia, resulting other businesses were lower than the first quarter. As you would expect during the period of increasing interest rates and widening credit spreads, client risk appetite declined at rates, credit and mortgages and inventory management was a bit more challenging during the later part of the quarter. Commodity results increased relative to the first quarter as volatility remain low in many of our core products and client activity was lower as a result.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Turning to equities, net revenues for the second quarter were $1.9 billion, down modestly from the first quarter. Equities client execution revenues were $638 million, down 21% sequentially; largely reflecting the impact of the sale of our reinsurance business. Commissions and fees were $836 million, up 5% from the first quarter due to improved market volumes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Security services net revenues of $376 million were 18% higher sequentially due to seasonally stronger client activity. With respect to risk average daily VaR in the second quarter was $81 million, up 7% from first quarter levels due to higher volatilities mainly in currencies. Adjusted for volatilities, VaR was relatively unchanged quarter-on-quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Let me now review Investing &amp; Lending. We produced net revenues of 1.4 billion in the second quarter. Investing &amp; Lending includes direct investing, investing due to funds as well as lending activities. These activities occur across a diversified set of asset classes, including both equity and debt.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Equity securities generated net revenues of 462 million, primarily reflecting gains from private equity investments. This increase in fair value was driven by company-specific events and strong corporate performance. Also, we sold our remaining stake in ICBC during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">The net gain over the quarter was a modest $7 million. Net revenues from debt securities and loans was 658 million, driven by company-specific events and interest income. Other revenues of 295 million were driven by the firm's consolidated investment entities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Switching to Investment Management, we reported second quarter net revenues of 1.3 billion, roughly consistent with the first quarter. Management and other fees were 1.1 billion, up 4% sequentially. During the second quarter, assets under supervision decreased 13 billion to 955 billion primarily reflecting net market depreciation and fixed income assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior-year equity awards and other items such as payroll taxes and benefits was accrued a compensation to net revenues ratio of 43% which is consistent with the firm's accrual in the first quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Second quarter non-compensation expenses were 2.3 billion, 5% lower than the first quarter, largely due to the sale of our reinsurance business. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 27%, driven by earnings that were permanently reinvested abroad. Year-to-date, our effective tax rate was 30.4%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On capital we repurchased 10.5 million shares of common stock for a total cost of 1.6 billion during the quarter. Our basic shares outstanding were 468 million at the end of the second quarter, down close to 6% over the last four quarters. At the end of the second quarter, our estimated Basel III tier 1 common ratio under the advanced approach was approximately 9.3% and reflects the final Basel III rules that were issued by the Federal Reserve on July 2nd. Obviously, we are still reviewing the final rule but this is our best estimate subject to change depending on regulatory clarifications.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Now, over the quarter, we took a number of strategic actions to bolster our capital position. As you will recall, we announced the potential sale of a majority stake in our reinsurance business even the Basel III capital charges that we incurred as a 100% owner of the business. We completed the sale of our reinsurance business in the second quarter. The sale includes our Basel III capital ratio by approximately 50 basis points and reduced the firm's balance sheet by $17 billion. This benefit was partially offset by implementations of the final Basel III rule set.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Now, at 9.3% we are close to having achieved our previously-stated target of the 8.5% requirement plus an approximate 100 basis point buffer. Regarding the leverage ratio, we also received the NPR last week. Even it's in the proposal stage, it's hard to speculate on how it will ultimately be finalized. However, we have significantly reduced our leverage since 2007. Since then we've reduced our assets by roughly 180 billion while increasing our equity base by over 80%. As a result, we feel reasonably well positioned for the new leverage requirements at both the holding company and the bank's subsidiary. But once again, it's a proposal so we will work with the regulators over the coming months.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Effectively managing the firm requires us to comply with a variety of different regulatory measures. Just as we've improved our Basel III capital ratio, we will have to continually adjust to any new regulations as they are finalized. As we have said in the past, a high level of risk-adjusted capital not only provides protection against tail events to all of our constituents, it also creates the foundation for capturing opportunities.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">With higher risk-adjusted capitalization, we are better positioned to help our clients navigate on uncertain economic environments and we can provide them with risk capital where capacity is diminished. An essential part of our role as managers on behalf of you, our shareholders, is to manage our capital effectively and efficiently in order to generate superior long-term returns.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Now in closing, we are cautiously optimistic about the outlook for the operating environment. Nevertheless, we remain vigilant regarding expenses and risks. Given the dynamic nature of the marketplace it's natural for people to become somewhat short-term focused. However, everyone at Goldman Sachs remains keenly aware that our success will be measured over years as opposed to weeks or months.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">To that end, we are going to continue to invest in deepening and expanding our client franchise, building relationships that will pass the test of time. We will continue to invest in our people, recruiting and retaining a group of professionals who are committed to providing solutions to our clients and driving value for our shareholders.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">With that, I'd like to thank you again for listening today. And I'm now happy to take your questions.</p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p4\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">(Operator Instructions). The first question comes from the line of Howard Chen with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Hi, Howard. How are you?</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Well, thanks. How are you?</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Great, thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">The more challenging conditions that you spoke to in the back half of the quarter with respect to client risk appetite and inventory management, was hoping you could comment how those difficult conditions persisted as we rebased it at new higher levels of U.S. benchmark rates or have they abated a bit?</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">So, I'd say we don't feel like they've abated a bit. I mean you see in the day-to-day volatility and that really is about I think the adjustments to people basically recalibrating to both a somewhat wider credit spread environment and obviously higher absolute interest rates and you can see that obviously it's quite visible, for example, in movements in a 10-year. So I think people are adjusting. What I would say is that it's now a very information-centric environment. And what I mean by that is people \u2013 all of our clients are going to be very keenly watching data, economic data whether it's nonfarm payrolls in United States, GDP growth in Europe, Japan, China, really trying to form their view because for the very long period of time, I think there was an expectation that this unusual low rate environment would persists. And to some extent people could build expectations around that. And now that we might be entering a different regime, you'll see people probably respond more to data but then again it's hard to [grade]. But I would say to answer your question the short way which is it does feel like people have recalibrated at this stage. And by the way and some of this, Howard, is returning to kind of normal interest rate levels, it feels good in some respects in terms of economic activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">There's where I was hoping to go next. It feels like we've been talking for a couple of years now about this wall client liquidity that's out there and your interest rates creating more of a one-way market in certain clusters like credit and mortgages. Have we seen enough of a move in your mind to see more two-way flow in some of these businesses that we've been hoping for?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">I think it's too early to tell which I why I highlighted the sensitivity to economic data. People are going to form their own impressions over the next several months and certainly everybody will be watching \u2013 clients are basically sitting on the edge of their seat for every communique out of the Federal Reserve and so there will be some sensitivity. But it feels like we're tracking more back to a period of normalcy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Great, thanks. And then I was hoping you could just update us on all of what the firm experienced as we progressed through phase 2 of U.S. mandatory clearing not only in all of what you're doing with respect to centralized clearing efforts but also maybe just broad health, liquidity, bid out spreads of the over-the-counter markets as we went through that transition?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Right. So, obviously from a Goldman Sachs perspective and this is an industry participant, we're thrilled to see clearing really coming into vogue now. And as we talked about in the last call, while it's taken a while and people could be frustrating at the pace of things, the reality is that I think the regulators and market participants have done really an excellent job of the progression of phase 1 and phase 2. And as you saw, there was lots of concerns in the marketplace and for all intents and purposes it went through without any hiccups. I think as it relates to sort of any material move in bid out spreads or volumes, there are no material change there and it's too early for that. I think, to the extent to which clearing had a long-term impact on market structure it will happen over many months and years like we\u2019ve seen in other market places.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Okay, thanks. And then just finally for me, thanks for the color on Basel 3 preparation, but just given the brightest steps you took with the reinsurance business and ICBC stakes, I was hoping if you\u2019d just update us on your current Basel 3 RWA breakdown and just where you\u2019re on passive and active mediation? Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Sure, so it's been a while since we\u2019ve updated this audience on risk-weighted assets, so I just want to walk through this a little bit carefully. The last time we talked to you last year we gave you a number of $728 billion in terms of risk-weighted assets. That number is now $600 billion. I\u2019m going to break it down and then I want to come back and reference the $728 billion I just mentioned. So the $600 billion our best estimate giving the final rule is $180 billion for market risk-weighted assets, $340 billion for credits, $80 billion for operation. Now you can obviously do the math, but that translates into $56 billion of Tier 1 common. The reason why I want to draw everyone\u2019s attention to the comparison of the $600 billion to the $728 billion is because the way the final rules came out it was certain deductions that we were previously assuming would be risk-weighted assets which actually became deductions to capital. And so the $600 billion versus the $728 billion is not really apples-to-apples, the best way to think about our current position under the final rules is the 9.3% which obviously as I said during my prepared remarks is 20 basis points within range of the buffer. In terms of passive, you should be thinking about roughly $35 billion in risk-weighted assets that will roll off between now and the end of 2015.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Thanks, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Your next question is from the line of Roger Freeman with Barclays. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Roger Freeman - Barclays</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Hi, good morning, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Good morning. How are you?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Roger Freeman - Barclays</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Hey, good, thanks. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess one just, maybe bouncing off couple of things Harvey was actually the -- so the market quality in rates and credit; would you characterize that as more normalized now in July. It sounds like in June that lack of for the dealer liquidity provision since maybe you contributed somewhat to the gapping and spreads, and I\u2019m just wondering if that\u2019s kind of part of the new world we live in now with new regulatory environment where assets prices move -- and moves and dealers are less apt to sort of take positional risks?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Yeah, so I think I would describe it more as things are episodic. In other words I don\u2019t think there is a massive transition that\u2019s occurred in terms of four weeks ago till today clearly when you get big moves in interest rates all market participants are going to adjust their risk profiles and you\u2019ll see flows for example out of fixed income assets into other assets. I think that, as I said I think it's quite normal for us to see this and people are nearly in a position of reassessing their risk profile, but in terms of Goldman Sachs I can\u2019t speak for the rest of the street. Goldman Sachs is we feel quite well positioned in terms of our ability to make capital for our clients.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Roger Freeman - Barclays</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay, thanks. And in I&amp;L, I wonder if you can, and you have talked a lot about this in the past, but just help us think about maybe the average age of maybe buckets within there, I\u2019m trying to, you\u2019ve been coming in ahead of expectations obviously it's the tough one to forecast, but I think you like a lot of public private equity firms we have aged portfolios and there\u2019s a realization process going on, and I wonder if you can kind of help us think about kind of really where you\u2019re at in that cycle?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Well, as we\u2019ve guided every one in the past generally speaking for the equity portfolio or reasonable guide it could be the MSCI, obviously there are divergence in this period. And as we\u2019ve always told people it's really just a guide and there are going to be periods where idiosyncratically there\u2019s elements of the portfolio where we under perform, there\u2019s going to be periods where we over perform, obviously relative to that kind of benchmark in this quarter we outperformed and it really is a combination of things like debt repayments and adjustments obviously interest income is in there, and again idiosyncratically components of the portfolio. In terms of aging, I didn\u2019t bring specific numbers with me Roger, but the private equity portfolio obviously trend to have sort of a longer term frame on it relative to the debt portfolio, but we can follow up with you and give you more detail if that\u2019s helpful.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay, all right thanks, and just maybe lastly just the liquidity levels can either run high and again it's kind of early days and thinking about leverage ratios and how some of the liquidity assets are yet sort of calculate into that; does that kind of change just thinking about how much liquidity you want to run with?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So, we\u2019re always going to run with an amount of liquidity which is really designed to protect the firm and at the same time put us in a position where we can provide capital and liquidity to our clients. With respect to the sort of metrics out there things like the liquidity coverage ratio and we feel very comfortable with respective things like that. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re going there, but in terms of the, since you mentioned leverage ratio, the only comment I\u2019d say that, we\u2019re not -- we\u2019re going to modulate our liquidity down because of a given metric that\u2019s in the market place even if an incentive exists with that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Roger Freeman - Barclays</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Okay, great. Thanks a lot, Harvey.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Hi, Michael.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Michael Carrier - Bank of America</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Hi. First question, maybe just back on the leverage ratio some of your unit piers have put out some guidance in terms of kind of a first take. If we look at Goldman and what you\u2019ve done on the Tier 1 common ratio, and there\u2019s obviously some mitigation that can be done, so I mean if you\u2019re below 5%, how are you guys thinking about achieving that whether it's through areas of asset mitigation that won't have a significant impact on the earnings power of Goldman or raising preferred or just what are the leverage that you guys have to get there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Again this is a rule that just came out; it's in proposal form. And as I said, our first assessment is we\u2019re very comfortable with where we are. Now and again there probably shouldn\u2019t be a surprise to anyone given all the work that\u2019s been done on the balance sheet since 2007 with an 80% increase in shareholder equity and a decrease of $108 million in the balance sheet as I said that\u2019s the kind of metric that we should be really well positioned for. Having said that it's in proposal form, so we\u2019ll have to see the final rule, and the only reason I\u2019m not being more specific about numbers in this stage is our team really hadn\u2019t had a time to building the kind of diligence that we would normally want them to, but as I said first we feel comfortable, lets see how the final rule is, we\u2019ll work with the regulators.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Michael Carrier - Bank of America</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay, got it. And then the fixed side of the business there\u2019s a lot of I\u2019d say uncertainty or debate on what the outlook is. You\u2019ve just given higher rates and potentially a decline on the down rating side and then fund outflows in certain products. On the flip side though you basically have market growth and then if Centrum Banks are less are backing out and are not as intervening in the market. It seems like volatility levels particularly in rates and FX could resume to more normalized levels. So when you look at that, the longer term outlook of FICC, it doesn\u2019t seem as if it\u2019s that simple, that rising rates should be in a more negative to the business, but just wanted to get your take on, when you think about the headwinds versus the potential for a more normalized market environment in some of the product areas, what could we potentially see over the next couple of years?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">It's a good question, but obviously exceptionally difficult to answer. Time will tell on that and we as a firm have had to navigate multiple rate regimes. If you just think about the rate regimes that we\u2019ve experienced since 2000 and the volatility associated with that and not because just we haven't been on unprecedented period of sort of globally coordinated decline in rates, but I do think that the -- to the extent at which rates are a proxy for the thing about the fixed income business from a forward view, I think it really depends on what the driver is. I think even though it seems exceptionally unlikely if rate increases were due to things like inflation, then I think it's a different scenario than if it's as I said kind of a returning to a normal world of more steady economic growth. I think that's a reasonably attractive opportunity set not just for [FX] potentially but obviously across the entire firm. And so that's what we're routing for. Now in terms of strategically positioning the business and we benefit from the fact that it's diversified, we can interact with our clients across the full suite of their interest, whether its currencies, mortgages, interest rates and we have the global footprint required to do that. So, in a quarter like this where Asia becomes particularly interesting, we can deliver for our clients because we're positioned and we're strategically connected to do that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Michael Carrier - Bank of America</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Okay. That makes sense. And then just finally, so on the expenses, I think you mentioned non-comp impacted on the reinsurance business. On the compensation side, anything \u2013 it just seems like the pickup in activity, you get some higher competitive environment gets a little bit tougher. Just any update on that front? And then just on the tax outlook, when you said the earnings permanently being directed outside, is there something that's going to be more, like, ongoing in terms of the tax rate or was this more of a quarterly benefit?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">No, it relates to the tax where you could just think of this as a quarterly benefit. The [war for] talents, it's something we do every day. I would say that there's nothing that we see in terms of sort of a shift. Goldman Sachs people are always in high demand and our competitors are always looking to take them over to their firms. I will say over the past several months, we've always felt like we're well positioned to recruit; we'll say its stealth like, we've had some recruiting tailwinds this year. Whether this is sustainable we'll see.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Michael Carrier - Bank of America</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay, all right. Thanks a lot.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hi, Betsy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Hi. How are you?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Good.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">A couple of questions. One just on the leverage ratio when you say you're comfortable, what's your definition of comfortable?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Comfortable? So I'm not trying to be cute with you. Look, it's just come out. Our team has looked at it. Our early read is all the things we've done in the balance sheet over the past several years has left us reasonably well positioned. And so I know that perhaps you'd like me to get more specific into the [number] at this stage, I just want to give the team the final time to really dot the i's and cross the t's. But as I said, we think we can manage without any major adjustments certainly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Okay, just to get \u2013 by year-end '18 to get to the 5% and 6%, is that --</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Sorry, by comfortable I don't mean that timeframe. But again, I want everyone to really know this is a proposed rule. So let's see how the dialogue evolves with the regulators.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yeah, I get it. Okay. On the RWA walkthrough which was helpful, I guess I'm wondering \u2013 you mentioned the 56 billion on the common tier 1 and that there were incremental deducts, right, relative to what was in the proposed rule. So, could you help us understand what you think you can do to mitigate those deducts going forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Well, right now as it relates to the ratio we're pretty comfortable. As we stated before, we plan to run with 100 basis point buffer and putting us in range of 20 basis points of that given the incredibly long [flight] path to compliance in 2019, we feel pretty comfortable. And one thing I do \u2013 you didn't ask specifically about this, but one thing I do want to give people a sense for is we talked about this 100 basis point buffer so that we can give people an estimate of where we thought we would ultimately land. Of course that was operating under a proposed set of rules, not finalized. So the way we typically work with metrics at Goldman Sachs is we introduce our own metrics for example is we'll work with them, we'll monitor them; we'll see how they move. And so we're going to do the same with this final Basel III rule now that we have it. And so in that sense, we feel quite comfortable. Now in the terms of the specific deductions, it mostly relates to financial institutions and at the specific deduction we can get into the [ways] offline if you'd like, but it relates to investments in funds and other things on balance sheet. Now it has to be the case that that sort of coincidentally runs parallel with sort of mitigating actions that we're taking under the \u2013 what we think the vocal rule is going to be when finalized. So we feel pretty good about that too.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Yeah. I was just wondering what you \u2013 the optionality you have to reduce those deducts? It sounds like there's some and you'll work on it and you'll address it as it happens? Is that fair?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">It's always been the case and we like to build it into the muscle memory of the firm that everyone knows we're going to have to adapt. I think if you look at what we've done over the past 18 months as it relates to the Basel III ratio and now we have the final rule we can really discuss it with you in clarity which is nice, I feel very good about our team's ability to continue to make progress.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">On the tax rate, you indicated in the press release and on the call that you made elections to permanently reinvest some earnings overseas. Does that imply a tax rate going forward that's different from what it's been in the past? I mean the first half was 30%. Is that what we should be using going forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">No, I answered that question just a second ago, Betsy. You might have missed it. You should just think of it as a one-time event for this quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay, all right. And then lastly on the reinsurance business, did you go through how that's going to be impacting \u2013 I mean you indicated the capital impacts, but I'm just wondering is there more to come with buybacks since it is positive for your Basel ratios or did you do everything with the buybacks that you were going to do this quarter with the reinsurance business? The reinsurance business changed, it freed up capital. Would you finish doing what you wanted to do with buybacks relative to that this quarter or is there more to come in the forward quarters?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay, I think I understand the question but if I don't you should correct me. We don't think about the capital management necessarily as being specifically linked to one individual asset disposition. So, it's a much longer timeframe in terms of how we think about the capital management. And so an easier way for me to say that would have been based on the quarter that we just went through, if we ended up selling the reinsurance business in the third quarter, you would have seen the same repurchase activity. Am I getting to your question, Betsy?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Yeah, I got it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. So actually on the reinsurance business \u2013 again, I would say it was a business that we liked in Goldman Sachs. It didn't make sense obviously under the new rules and so we're in a position where quite frankly a win-win for us and our clients in the investing division because we're able to take the action that we did.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">All right, thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So a follow-up on Mike's question. If sort of the market is a big more data driven, does that mean that you guys would expect that the rates business should remain strong as clients continue to adjust and reposition based upon incremental data points going up?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Very difficult to tell, and we don't run the business week-to-week in terms of how the market's responding. Obviously we stay very focused on the risk dynamics in the marketplace when we go through the risk committee and obviously in the trenches. But strategically the way you have to interact with clients whether it's for example long-term investors that are managing pension obligations or insurance companies and the flipside this might even be more market sensitive to our total return business. So we just have to make sure that we stay very, very focused on our clients and it's a good opportunity because it's a content differentiating world right now. And so we have an opportunity to do that. We just have to deliver.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Okay. And then I guess when you think about in that context thinking about your business and how you guys are approaching it given what you're seeing, we're seeing some slowing growth out of China strengthening dollar. How do you think about positioning of the commodities business in that context and while certainly it might not change strategic perception to the business, maybe does it have an impact on your thinking from a tactical perspective?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I think it's actually to say it literally had zero impact on how we think about the data and management of the commodity business and I emphasized that zero only because we run that business for the long-term. We entered that business in 1981 it's been core to our clients and core to the entire integrated strategy of the security division which includes both fixed income and equities. And so those kinds of near term adjustments in the market place super relevant for the conversations that our people on the ground are having with their clients all around the globe, but not a dictator to us in terms of how we think about our multi-decade commitment to the commodity business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">No, sure. I just was curious about whether or not it might impact more short-term tactical decisions for those capital allocations and the like.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">No the capital -- we don\u2019t dial down the capital to the business. The client demand and the client activity levels will drive the capital needs that we provide.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay, that\u2019s fair. And then last one for me, it looks like there were some a moderate issuance of some preferred this quarter. Did that have anything to do with the leverage ratio coming out or was that something else driving that issuance?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">No, that was part of our long-term capital plan. We had no insight into the leverage ratio.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I had to given one last parting shot for the leverage ratio there, you know.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">I like the persistence.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question is from the line of Kian Abouhossein with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Hi, Kian.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JPMorgan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yes, hi. The first question is regarding [SEF] platform, we had some clarity in respect to the submission of [SEF] platform, just wondering how you\u2019re preparing for this, how you\u2019re positioning yourself, if you can give us a little bit of color in that respect?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So, we have a long history of adopting and participating in platform developments, obviously it goes all the way back to trade web and we both developed our own internal platforms and we participate in external platforms. So, I don\u2019t think this represents any specific hurdles in terms of participating in that. I do think it will be quite interesting as trading moves over to swap execution facilities later in the year maybe to the beginning of next year, I think it will be quite interesting to see the market dynamic around that and particularly as we interface the finalized rules how the business evolves.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JPMorgan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And in terms of technological platform, is there anything that you\u2019re developing new, now that you have a bit more clarity in terms of a technological platform is there anything you can add in respect to how your response to that, how you try to differentiate to keep flows or gain new flows?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">So once you have evolved, the way and we talked about this before. One of our competitive advantages assuming we execute is the fact that no we have SecDB, which is our internally developed platform. It is the platform that we use across all of our businesses whether you\u2019re trading currencies in Asia or if you\u2019re trading stocks in United States and so that should give us some advantage in terms of how we vision our self and our speed and our ability to adapt. But I think the early stage of this, I can\u2019t -- maybe I\u2019m wrong, but I think the early stage of this is somewhat similar to clearing and that it's all about educating the clients, interface with the clients and making sure that connectivity works for them, it's a big adjustment in terms of execution protocol for them. And then what we\u2019ve just \u2013 really the differentiating thing is the content, and we just have to keep providing content.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JPMorgan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay, that\u2019s helpful -- that\u2019s really helpful. Just on securitization, we clearly heard from some of the banks that at the current level of interest rates production of mortgages could decline, thus wondering and it could have a material impact. Now just wondering since you\u2019re such a big securitization player especially on mortgages, so wondering how do you see that business developing assuming that yields do stay the higher level, and would you call that material?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">You have a better view on the competitors and their exposure to securitization. We\u2019ve never really been big in securitization as it relates to sort of the new issue pipeline of for example residential mortgages, obviously we\u2019ve been a big participant over the past several years in our ability to connect capital for clients, moving portfolios -- secondary portfolios. For example people would be risking out of Europe and connecting investors in the U.S. But I don\u2019t know necessarily that I would attribute any concern to higher interest rates for us as it relates to the securitization activity level. Now that may translate into less activity for the entire industry. And it's really I think to some degree a bit of, of how it evolves over the next six months in terms of peoples expectations. Again if it's a particular volatile period it could have a different impact if we settle in and people feel a certain confidence around economic activity, it could clearly translate quite differently.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JPMorgan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay, that\u2019s quite helpful. And the last question is, on the securitization consultation document by Basel that came out quite a while ago, now six months ago. I am sure you had the chance to look through it and just wondering if this could have a material impact on your risk-weighted asset changes that you just outlined, assuming that it comes as it's -- assuming it becomes as discussed in the paper?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Yeah, so I don\u2019t have any specific comments as it relates to the details of the paper. What I would say is, I think the really important takeaway as it relates to all of these regulatory processes is it's all about an ability to adapt. All firms are going to operate in the same rule sets. And so historically we\u2019ve done a pretty good job of adapting and we just need to continue adapting. And one of the things I\u2019ve said is, and I like to think of a bit of as an operating principal is a very, very low premium on trying to predict the outcome of rules. But it's huge, huge premium on adapting once you see them. Predicting rules and responding can be incredibly costly, you can get widely misdirected and you can lose track to your clients. Responding to rules, once they\u2019re finalized that really is a differentiating factor and we have to execute.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JPMorgan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Thanks, Kian.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">A follow up question to your comment to the pipelines were relatively stable versus the end of last quarter, and I know it's early in the quarter here, but just any thoughts in terms of a change in the mix. I think a lot of people view that if rates increase like the way they did that\u2019s in the debt issuance for dry out, I mean as we know that\u2019s not always the case, but has there been any change in the mix in the pipeline maybe even within the debt business a mix change in terms of like away from high yield towards certain things?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Well, as I said in the opening the backlog was basically unchanged quarter-over-quarter from first quarter to second quarter, and just to give you a little bit of color, it was down a very small amount of advisory at the end of the quarter and it was up in underwriting. In terms of where it is, it's too early in the quarter to see how things will revolve, so I wouldn\u2019t take any material takeaways from any changes over the past two weeks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay, and then the sales of the reinsurance business was there a gain or a loss?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">So, there was nothing material with the sale of the reinsurance business. Just to give people some context on that business, obviously I have come through a lot of detail already, but since you\u2019re asking the question it represented just under 2% of last years pre-tax income.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. And then just separately, if we back out some of the revenues from the reinsurance business, you just have a stub piece this quarter, if you back that all out, I mean it seems like the equity derivative business is doing pretty well, and we\u2019re seeing that in some other banks as well. Just wondering obviously volatility had been low -- lowed out a little bit, sometimes that can be good, sometimes not. Just what's driving some of the good trends in the equity derivative area?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yeah, so as you mentioned last year second quarter 2012 there was $259 million from revenues in the reinsurance business obviously significantly less, 80 plus million in this quarter. So when you adjust after that you\u2019re right a strong performance in the equity business. Part of that equity derivatives I will say there was \u2013 there were \u2013 I'd say two other drivers; one is there was some good opportunities to provide our clients with capital around index rebalancings and other areas where we could really lean into the strength of client relationships, technology and capital committing in a way that I think leaves us quite well positioned, and obviously I noted that our performance in the equity derivative business broadly. But there's a little bit of a \u2013 everybody keeps talking about the rotation out of fixed income into equities and who knows how that will play out over the next decade. But certainly a lot of activity in equities space, particularly in Asia.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Okay. Thank you very much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question is from the line of [Jim Miller] with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Hi. It's Jim Mitchell.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Hi, Jim. Sorry about that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">It's okay. On the Central Clearing, just a follow-up. Have you done any work, and I know it's early days, in terms of what the potential capital benefits could be and moving to more of the business to Central Clearinghouse and what that may mean also with respect if anything benefit with respective leverage ratios that relates to derivatives?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yeah, we haven't \u2013 it's early days so we haven't spent a huge amount of time in terms of the capital benefits. As these leverage ratios unfold, one of the things I'm sure we'll get a lot of debate in the proposal process is the extent to which custody of client assets. Effectively people just putting money in a safe or holding collateral, how that plays out in a leverage ratio but we haven't done a huge amount of work as it relates to capital benefit at this stage.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I think it's fair to assume it should have some of that benefit but you just haven't really put your arms around it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Yeah, we would expect over long term, a capital benefit but I think more importantly we've always been quite conservative we feel relative to the broad marketplace as it relates to the extension of credit and the extent to which more activities is cleared, obviously that levels the playing field and removes the ability of our third or fourth quartile more marginal competitor in a specific space to compete on terms. They have to compete on content and execution. But look, again early days and not seeing any tailwinds or headwinds at this stage.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay, thanks. And one quick question on the asset management business. You guys have seen pretty consistent outflows in alternatives the last year or so. What's driving that I mean if you look at the industry and you've seen pretty much inflows and alternatives, is it just a performance or it is a mix issue, how do we think about the alternative space for you guys?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So we're very focused on it. In terms of the trend obviously it's been a very important component of our business. Nothing specific there. The only thing I would say is that obviously as we previously announced, in anticipation of adjusting for that component of the vocal rule which we think will be in the finalized rule, we have been removing our own capital.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And that would show up as outflows?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">No, not as third party.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Okay, all right. Thanks a lot.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Your next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous. Please go ahead, sir.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Hi, Guy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research LLP</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Good morning. This is a slightly different kind of the question that was asked a minute ago on OTC derivatives. As we transition to a regime of much more of what used to be OTC being centrally cleared, is it the right way to think about the existing OTC derivatives portfolio as essentially being a run-off portfolio in a way and therefore sort of a source of passive release?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">No. I want to make sure I understand your question clearly. The things that for example that we think are [indiscernible] businesses, for example, pre-crisis businesses like correlation books and things like that which just aren't relevant to our clients today and are quite capital consumptive under the new rule sets. So as it relates to clearing, given the number of instruments we have cleared now, I don't think the two really overlap. I do think that \u2013 I'll speculate a little bit here. I do think that as these rules get finalized and we're only living with really clearing for a couple of months now and then when we come into swap execution facilities, the venture \u2013 very interesting to see the impact that has on client activity which as best we can tell was a little dampened for the industry given the uncertainty around the rule sets. And so as we get certainty, it could be a little bit of a tailwind for volumes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research LLP</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Yeah, that was helpful. But the question really was sort of around as you think about for example leverage ratio and I'll stipulate to the fact that all my numbers show that you guys are pretty much where you need to be. But as you think about ways of mitigating down to where you might want to be if you weren't where you wanted to be and the add backs to the denominator of that ratio include a lot of off balance sheet OTC derivatives driven assets. Won't those be coming down quite significantly naturally over the next several years if in fact the regulatory shift towards centrally cleared derivatives really takes hold or am I thinking about that the wrong way?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">No, I think you're right. The extent to which [indiscernible] leads to depending on the metric that we're observing, reduced notionals or other things then that's a natural tailwind for the industry. I think more importantly one thing we're all subject to having sort of kneejerk reactions to these proposed rules when they come out. I will say the regulators consistently, as least so far, have been very thoughtful about the glide path. So the adjustment process if we needed to make one, the way we would approach that is the way we've approached all the other rules that we've lived with as they've come into place, which is we evaluate the rule, we deploy tools to our people and in that context of delivering to our clients and at the same time maximizing the return to the shareholders, we'd adjust. So that's how we would handle it. But I think the nuance question around whether clearing is a tailwind to reduce I think the answer is yes on that. But I'm not [keeping the weeds] on that specific issue but we will get back to you on it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research LLP</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay. That would be great. Just a couple of quick housekeeping type questions. Have you spoken to the RWA that was associated with the reinsurance business?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">No. And the reason why I didn't do that is not because I'm not happy to have the conversation but the way the sale to reinsurance has worked, it actually is it's a bit of adjustments to equity and it's also adjustments to RWAs, so I think the best way to frame it for all of you is just to say the net outcome is 50 basis points.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research LLP</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay, that helps. And then the final one would be you talked about your 9.3% estimated core tier 1 under Basel III under the advanced approach. Can you tell us what it would be under the standardized approach?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So with respect to the standardized approach, we're still finalizing the numbers there but our first review is we're comfortably over the minimum requirements. But at this stage it's sort of the same with the leverage ratio, I want the team to really finalize the numbers before I cross the i and dot the t's on that, but we're comfortably and hopefully in excess.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research LLP</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Okay, fair enough. Thanks very much for taking my questions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Hi. You mentioned some inventory management in June. Can you give us some sense for what sort of marks were involved?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">No, there's nothing specific to comment on that. I was just trying to give you a little bit of extra color on how the quarter wrapped up, but I'm sure it wasn't surprising to anyone given the volatility in markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Can you give some sense of break down between the U.S. and non-U.S. sort of revenue gross you're seeing and are you still as fully committed to the BRIC strategy as you've always been?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So no change in commitment and the mix hasn't changed significantly. It's down a little bit in the Americas, up a little bit in Europe but there are no material changes. But the core part of your question, which I think is the most important part is in terms of the strategic approach of the firm, very, very committed, very focused to those markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">All right. And I think the word of the day is comfortable and so I'll ask prior to the sixth or seventh question on the leverage ratio, but it just seems \u2013 you're comfortable with where you are which is I think what I hear you saying is trust us, we'll be there. On the other hand, you're not disclosing a number like your peers have done and perhaps other peers will do. So, on a disclosure basis, you\u2019re behind peers. I\u2019m just trying to reconcile the two thoughts?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">You know when we look at NPRs, our approach might be a little bit different and you\u2019ve seen from the peers, look \u2013 I suspect you could have said the same thing about Basel III process where I think you probably felt the same way in terms of being behind peers in terms of level of disclosure. Look one of the reasons that is, is because if we give you $728 billion and we update it quarter to quarter to quarter and then it dropped to $600 billion, I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re giving you a lot of value in that. I think there is much more value in sharing the process with you. Now when we have real confidence in the exact number, then we will be fine to share with you. But as I said, may be comfortable is the word of the day, we\u2019re comfortable.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Can you give us a sense of its above some number and give us that number?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">You\u2019re looking for shades of gray in comfortable?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Pretty comfortable.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Pretty \u2013 now just \u2013 last follow-up on that, because it goes \u2013 someone had said by 2018 you will get there or by 2015 or you will pass the Fed\u2019s stress test or will you be able to buyback shares as quickly as you\u2019ve done. That\u2019s really what it comes down to I think.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yeah, I wouldn\u2019t extrapolate too much information from the proposed rule set with respect to 2018 is miles away, if that gives you some context of how we\u2019re thinking about our initial review of the ratio. I\u2019m not trying to be flipping with you. When we really finalize the numbers, I\u2019m happy to come back to on it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>) Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">All right. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question is from the line of Fiona Swaffield with RBC Capital Markets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Fiona Swaffield - RBC Capital Markets</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Hi. Good morning. I just had questions in two areas. Sorry to come back to the 9.3% Basel III, but I was trying to understand the movement in the quarter. I think you mentioned some offsets to the 50 basis points. So it was really I thought ICBC would also being positive and you made a little bit of money over and above the buybacks. So could you explain where it was the rules got tighter versus your original expectations? And the second area was just generally there seem to be lots of discussion about wholesale funding, particularly secured. I wondered if you could discuss whether you\u2019re doing anything to change your weighted average maturity or what your kind of view is on the wholesale funding area.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So, with respect to the first, there are always going to be pluses and minuses when you get a final rule set in terms of things that impact your ratio. But the reality is that I think the key driver here and we\u2019re happy to spend more time with you offline is what referred to as the financial institutions deduction, and as I said before it comes \u2013 it\u2019s a deduction from capital and it relates to both investments and funds, and also financial institution assets that we hold on balance sheet as part of our liquidity provision to clients. And so we\u2019re happy to walk you through that in more detail. The rest of its kind of pluses and minuses back and forth.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Fiona Swaffield - RBC Capital Markets</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So just a follow-up, the $600 billion number that you gave for Basel III, has that been relatively consistent excluding the insurance kind of noise over the last couple of quarters?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Well, the one reason why I tried to draw the distinction between what you brought out in the fourth quarter of last year the 728 is just the change in the rule set. So, obviously there is passive things that occur, there is incremental capital built up during the quarter. But I think the primary takeaway should be the headline number of 9.3%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Fiona Swaffield - RBC Capital Markets</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">And now that \u2013 now we have the final rule, we will keep up updated with respect to how the RWAs move.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question is from the line of Douglas Sipkin with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Yes, thank you and good morning. Just wanted to drill down actually on some of the operations, specifically debt, just curious for your perspective, I think it was touched on earlier, I mean, what do you guys think if rates start to move up, obviously debt underwriting has been a real nice area for you guys, my first question. And then, secondly it does look like within that you guys are maybe out punching. I\u2019d be curious to hear where you think you\u2019re gaining some market share by product or geography with respect to debt underwriting? Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Sure. So, in terms of the recalibration of interest rates, I think very difficult to predict, near-term what impact that have in terms of the debt market\u2019s appetite for new issues and the issuers ability or desire to pull the trigger on a particular transaction. I will say that, I think one of the most frequently asked questions we got at the end of the fourth quarter was the ability of the debt performance to continue and it was the same question at the end of the first quarter. So, obviously we will see how things unfold.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">With respect to how we position the business, I listed off some of the transactions that we executed during the quarter, and really leveraged finance was a significant driver and this is all about again staying extremely focused on our clients. Particularly in our Investment Banking franchise where we\u2019re working with CFO's and CEO\u2019s and how they think about their balance sheets or how they think strategically about merger activity.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">But again, the core message here is we\u2019re less focused on the quarter activity and much more just focused on the client long-term.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Great. Thanks for answering.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Your next question is from the line of Christopher Wheeler with Mediobanca. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Christopher Wheeler - Mediobanca Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Yes, good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Good morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Christopher Wheeler - Mediobanca Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Perhaps I could go back to the leverage ratio without actually asking a direct question about that. But it was really about the other components of your Tier 1 capital; clearly apart from your core Tier 1 you have 7.2 billion now preferred stock and I think about 2 billion at the end of the last quarter in junior subordinated debt. I\u2019m trying to get my head around how much of that is Basel III compliance and whether or not any of that is going to have to be replaced if you go through the amortization, which obviously is important in terms of the leverage ratio. And also perhaps whether you\u2019ve already considered part of your efforts to improve the leverage ratio, not improve it, but to reach the number is to actually start to issue some of this additional Tier 1 capital, which is going to be compliant with [Basel] and whether the regulators have given you any clue yet, your regulator as to what exactly are the characteristics of that new debt would have to be?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">No, we don\u2019t have any specific insight in terms of any of the new debt proposals that you would have seen. As far as observation about the capital structure obviously preferred are fine. Trust preferred are being looked at, but we\u2019ll circle back to you with respect, but there is no change in anything as it relates to capital planning. By the way, I\u2019d say that with respect to how we\u2019re thinking about share repurchase too. No changes in respect to capital planning as a result of any of the finalized proposed rules that we see in the marketplace.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Christopher Wheeler - Mediobanca Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Have you looked at all what the cost of boosting your Tier 1 capital might be? Because clearly that\u2019s an issue a lot of banks are looking at certainly in the European markets at the moment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">We evaluate the cost all the time, but it\u2019s not a question of cost so much. It is a question about basically positioning the firm to run it conservatively and position it for clients. So, it look \u2013 I think if you were on a discussion with our treasury team and myself talking about how we should think about cost at the margin, we\u2019re much more concerned about the stability of the capital structure and less about cost.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Christopher Wheeler - Mediobanca Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Okay. That\u2019s encouraging. Thank you very much. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Thanks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Your next question is from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Hey, Matt.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Matthew Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Good morning, Harvey. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple of quickies I think. Your long-term unsecured debt at least according to the press release is down roughly 5 billion quarter-over-quarter. How are you thinking about debt levels going forward and have you changed your thinking at all on OLA and how that will affect your debt balance going forward?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">So, just Orderly Liquidation Authority just for everyone dialing in, obviously any wall set that conceptually is designed to create order, in principal, we don\u2019t have any issues with. We haven\u2019t seen the detail in the weeds on that. And it gets back to what I said earlier, we\u2019re not going to adjust the capital structure of the firm based on a discussion or where we kind of guess things will come out. That\u2019s not the way we\u2019re going to think about or manage the capital structure. So, no changes and now at best we can tell. Again, these are all in discussions, so we don\u2019t have details. So as best we could tell given the amount of debt we have at the Holdco, one might say that we\u2019re reasonably well positioned, but again, really big caveat on that. We haven\u2019t seen any details.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Matthew Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Let me come at the same question from a different direction. Are your capital markets team and debt underwriting looking positively at that idea or is that \u2013 or they of the same opinion?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I think we need more details. There is \u2013 we\u2019ve seen a lot of views in the marketplace.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Matthew Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Let me switch the question to activity levels across your broad geographic groups; Europe, Asia, U.S./North America, were there any meaningful improvements in activity level maybe outside the U.S. this quarter that helped the revenue side of things or were there any areas of particular weakness?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Well, certainly the activity levels in Japan and when I say Japan I don't necessarily mean specifically Japan geographically but activity that's driven around Japan. So, given the global nature of our clients one of the most important things that we need to do across the entire firm is make sure that we connect geographically in a way to deliver content. So it might be clients in Europe that are very focused on events in Japan, same as the U.S. So a lot of capturing that is making sure that they content mechanism works and a transmission mechanism works. And so I'll say Japan was a driver certainly of increased activity but not just isolated to Japan that's not on benefits.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Matthew Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And would you characterize Europe as still being a little bit below Asia and the U.S. in terms of activity levels given the economic conditions there?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">I mean that's fair. I think there's more upside in Europe and I think there's more upside specifically \u2013 and again, this could play out over many years. I think there's more upside specifically for U.S. based firms like ourselves Goldman Sachs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Matthew Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay, thanks for your time.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Your next question is from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead, sir.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Hi, Chris.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Christoph Kotowski - Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Hi. My questions were asked and answered. Thank you.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Harvey M. Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay, Chris. Thanks for dialing in.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">At this time, there are no further questions. Do you have any closing remarks?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Dane E. Holmes</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">No. We'd like to thank everybody for dialing into the call. Obviously, if people have any questions they should feel free to direct them to us in the Investor Relations department. Otherwise, enjoy the rest of your day and the week.

I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs third quarter 2013 earnings conference call. This call is being recorded today, October 17, 2013. Thank you. Mr. Holmes, you may now begin your conference.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Dane Holmes</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, director of investor relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Today\u2019s call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm\u2019s belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain and outside of the firm\u2019s control. The firm\u2019s actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm\u2019s future results, please see the description of risk factors in our current annual report on Form 10-K for our year ended December 2012.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, and Global Core Excess. And you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures and regulatory capital ratios that are posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com. </p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">This audiocast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced, or rebroadcast without our consent.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Our chief financial officer, Harvey Schwartz, will now review the firm\u2019s results. Harvey?</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Thanks, Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in today. I\u2019ll walk you through our third quarter results, and then take your questions. Net revenues for the quarter were $6.7 billion, net earnings, $1.5 billion, earnings per diluted share, $2.88, and our year to date annualized return on common equity was 10.4%.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">While there were some headwinds in the third quarter, our year to date performance remained solid, in what continues to be a challenging macro-environment. On last quarter\u2019s call, we talked about how market participants were trying to assess the outlook for the global economy, specifically whether a recovering U.S. economy could potentially offset slower growth in other economic regions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">In addition, the shifting commentary on monetary policy was leading our clients to question the potential economic and market impacts of reduced quantitative easing. These discussions continued in the third quarter. Ongoing uncertainty around the economic outlook and the traditional seasonal slowdown drove a significant reduction in client activity during the quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">This reduction in nationwide client activity obviously impacted the opportunity set in many of our businesses. In investment banking, equity and equity related volumes declined 27% quarter over quarter. Debt [unintelligible] volumes declined 10% versus the prior quarter, and completed M&amp;A volumes declined 36% sequentially.</p>", "<p class=\"p p1\">Within our institutional client services businesses, most product areas also experienced reduced levels of client activity. For example, within credit products, investment grade and high-yield volumes declined sequentially by 13% and 19% respectively when looking at trades data. In U.S. equity markets, stock buy-ins were down 13% to an average daily volume of 5.8 billion shares. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">However, activity improved in September with our investment banking clients. Announced M&amp;A volumes increased significantly, and overall backlog improved to its highest level in five years. During the quarter, we also saw continued positive trends within our investment management business. Assets under supervision reached a record level, aided by $17 billion of net inflows. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">I\u2019ll now run through each of our businesses. Investment banking produced third quarter net revenues of $1.2 billion, down 25% from the second quarter. Third quarter advisory revenues were $423 million, down 13% from the second quarter, reflecting a decline in industry-wide completed M&amp;A transactions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Year to date, Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced and completed M&amp;A. We advise on a number of important transactions that closed in the third quarter, including Softbank\u2019s $21.6 billion purchase of a majority stake in Sprint, Bausch &amp; Lomb\u2019s $8.7 billion sale to Valeant, and Apache\u2019s $3.75 billion sale of selected assets to Fieldwood Energy.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">We\u2019re also an advisor on a number of significant announced transactions. They include Vodafone\u2019s U.S. $130 billion disposal of its U.S. group, whose principal asset is its 45% interest in Verizon Wireless; Applied Materials\u2019 merger with Tokyo Electron for a combined value of $29 billion; and Grohe\u2019s $3.9 billion sale of a majority stake to Lixil.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Third quarter net revenues were $743 million, down 30% from a strong second quarter. Equity underwriting revenues of $276 million were down 26% compared with the second quarter, driven by a decline in industry-wide activity. Year to date, Goldman Sachs ranked first in global equity and equity-related common stock offerings and IPOs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Switching over to debt, underwriting revenues were $467 million, and represented a 33% decline relative to a record second quarter. During the third quarter, there were several noteworthy transactions: BHP Billiton\u2019s $5 billion debt offering, Schaeffler\u2019s $1.3 billion sale of a portion of its equity stake in Continental\u00a0, and ADT\u2019s $1 billion high-yield offering. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Let me now turn to institutional client services. Total net revenues were $2.9 billion in the third quarter. Fixed client execution net revenues were $1.2 billion in the third quarter, substantially lower than the second quarter, clearly not a good quarter for FIC. The significant decline in revenues was driven in part by seasonally slower activity levels seen across the industry and a more challenging macro-environment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">While rates were up relative to a weak second quarter, activity levels remained muted. Revenues within currencies decreased significantly relative to the second quarter, on difficulty managing inventory and reduced activity levels. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Commodities decreased significantly versus the second quarter under challenging market making conditions and also lower client activity levels. Revenues within credit decreased significantly on lower volumes. Mortgage results decreased sequentially as clients became more risk averse given the potential for tapering in the U.S.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Turning to equities, net revenues for the third quarter were $1.6 billion, down 13% from the second quarter. Equities client execution revenues were $549 million, down 14% sequentially. If you adjust for the sale of our Americas reinsurance business in the second quarter, revenues essentially flat. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Commissions and fees were $727 million, down 13% from the second quarter, again reflecting lower market volumes. Security services net revenues of $340 million declined 10% from the seasonally stronger second quarter. </p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">With respect to risk, average daily volume in the third quarter was $84 million, up 4% from second quarter levels.</p>", "<p class=\"p p2\">Let me now review investing and lending. We produced net revenues of $1.5 billion in the third quarter. Investing and lending includes direct investing, investing we do through funds, as well as lending activities. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">These activities occur across a diversified set of asset classes, including both equity and debt. Equity securities generated net revenues of $938 million, primarily reflecting gains from private equity investments. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">This increase in fair value was driven by company-specific events like IPOs, strong corporate performance, and higher equity prices. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $300 million, primarily from interest income. Other revenues of $237 million include the firm\u2019s consolidated investment entities. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Switching to investment management, we reported third quarter net revenues of $1.2 billion. Management and other fees were $1.1 billion, 1% lower sequentially. During the third quarter, assets under supervision increased $36 billion to a record $991 billion. Net market appreciation of $19 billion was primarily in equity assets, while $17 billion in inflows were concentrated in fixed income assets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior-year equity awards, and other items such as payroll taxes and benefits was accrued at a compensation to net revenues ratio of 41% year to date.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">This is 200 basis points lower than the firm\u2019s accrual in the first half of the year. The lower compensation accrual reflects year-to-date revenues and better visibility on expected compensation levels as we approach the end of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Third quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.2 billion, 4% lower than the second quarter, largely due to the sale of our reinsurance business and lower brokerage, clearing, and execution costs.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Year to date, our effective tax rate was 30.3%. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">On capital, we repurchased 10.2 million shares of common stock for a total cost of $1.65 billion during the quarter. Year to date, we have repurchased 30.8 million shares for a total cost of $4.77 billion. Today, we also announced an increase in our quarterly common stock dividend from $0.50 to $0.55 per share.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Moving on to regulatory capital ratios, our Basel III tier one common ratio on a fully loaded basis is 9.8%, up 50 basis points from the second quarter, driven by a reduction in risk. The risk-weighted assets are approximately $590 billion, $345 billion in credit risk, $165 billion in market risk, and about $80 billion in operational risk.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Our estimate for the proposed supplementary leverage ratio under U.S. rules is approximately 5% for the firm and approximately 6% for the bank. This is our best estimate, subject to change, depending on regulatory clarifications. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Like all other proposed regulatory requirements, we will work closely with our regulators as we evaluate and finalize the proposal. We believe it is our obligation to support safety and soundness within the financial services industry and the global financial system. As it relates to how we\u2019ll run the business, similar to other regulatory metrics, the supplementary leverage ratio will be an important input. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Clearly, concerns about the global economic outlook created a more difficult operating environment for our clients in the third quarter. These challenges were amplified by the seasonal slowdown traditionally impacting client activity in July and August. </p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">However, we don\u2019t build client relationships or build businesses for a quarter. Client relationships and operating businesses require years, often decades, of investment to build the durability that ultimately creates long-term shareholder value.</p>", "<p class=\"p p3\">Across the globe, our investment banking clients seek our advice on their most important strategic decisions. Corporate, government, and institutional asset management clients look to our execution and risk management capabilities across a variety of products and regions. We are entrusted to provide investment management services and offer investment products across all major asset classes through a diverse set of institutional and individual clients, making us one of the largest asset managers in the world.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">Our clients often value our advice and services the most when the outlook is less certain, and when finding solutions becomes more challenging. The U.S. government shutdown and the debate in the United States surrounding the government debt ceiling has become a concern for our clients. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">The political complexity involved in finding a long-term solution has created uncertainty about the world\u2019s economic outlook, and as we have all seen, has weighed heavily on market sentiment. Now that the political impasse looks to be resolved for the near term, we\u2019re hopeful that greater certainty will drive improved client confidence and activity levels. Having said that, a long term solution is critical to the sustained recovery for the economy. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">These fluctuations have not distracted us from focusing on the long term drivers of our business, so as a management team, we are focused first and foremost on our clients, building deep, meaningful relationships and providing solutions to their daily challenges. We are focused on conservatively managing our financial profile and being prudent allocators of capital. We are also focused on being efficient operators, while at the same time providing world-class service to our clients</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In the end, we are focused on creating long term shareholder value for you, our shareholders.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">With that, I\u2019d like to thank you again for listening today, and I\u2019m happy now to take your questions. </p>", "<p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"p p4\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">[Operator instructions.] Your first question is from the line of Howard Chen with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">I was hoping to come back to your commentary on FIC. Understanding all of your peers\u2019 business mix is different, but the relative revenue performance this quarter is pretty wide. So I was just hoping you could add a bit more color on how you would attribute that gap to your relative business mix, the positioning issues you noted, and maybe just more challenging comparables.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">As I said a few minutes ago, clearly a difficult environment for FIC, and we\u2019re not happy with the results. So having said that, with respect to business mix, I think there could be something there in terms of how different franchises are positioned. Certainly as we\u2019ve discussed with you in the past, our FIC business may be somewhat more weighted towards institutional asset managers. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">If I back up for a second, if you remember on last quarter\u2019s call, somebody asked me a question about how I thought the market would respond to the potential changes in monetary policy, and the discussion really is around how data-centric people would be. And of course we came into the summer with less certainly around monetary policy, and then there were events in the Middle East, and then of course people actually couldn\u2019t get data with the government shutdown. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">So I think there could be something in that. So, I think the whole market environment is not good for that particular client base. However, I don\u2019t want to sound defensive. Again, just not a good quarter for us in FIC.</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">And then you specifically mentioned foreign exchange in your commentary. Can you talk a bit more on what exactly happened in the quarter in that business, and are you able to size the potential facilitation issue and the impact it had on the quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p4\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">In terms of the currency business, obviously it was a business I highlighted, where it was challenging market making conditions and certainly from an inventory perspective. You know, we look at various metrics. </p>", "<p class=\"p p4\">I mean one metric I could point to, for example, would be the VAR schedule in the earnings release. And as you can see, basically from the first quarter to the second quarter, there was a lot of activity in the franchise, and risk had picked up in foreign exchange, and then you\u2019ll see quarter over quarter it\u2019s a pretty significant drop in the currency line. And that\u2019s virtually all driven by risk reduction.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">In terms of the franchise itself, this I will say, we look at a variety of metrics like you would think, all the numbers we can. We look at our own internal numbers, sales activity, where we can get transparency into the market. But there\u2019s nothing in that data that would tell us that when we look at the metrics, client engagement looks consistent with those kind of volumes. So, franchise feels good. We just had a tough quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">And then shifting gears to the comp accrual, it\u2019s pretty unusual to see the firm change the accrual in the third quarter. So, I was just hoping to better understand what\u2019s different this year. Is the message that in this still challenged backdrop, your desire is to not fall below a certain return threshold?</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Well, as always, the comp accrual is based on our best estimate for where we think we\u2019ll end up for the end of the year, but of course we still have a quarter to go. I think as it relates to compensation expense, as we\u2019ve talked about before, it\u2019s obviously the firm\u2019s largest expense, and so this process, no different. This I want to be clear with everyone. No difference in terms of philosophy in the way we\u2019re approaching compensation. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">So it\u2019s still all the same things we go through in terms of the pay for performance culture that we drive, and so we\u2019ll look at all the components, competitive dynamic, performance, as I mentioned. And of course shareholders and ROE and the way we incorporate that in our thinking, that\u2019s always of course an important meaningful component of it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">And finally, with a few more months since the initial proposals have been out, I was hoping you could just update us on your thoughts on supplemental leverage ratio, where the firm may sit today and potential mitigating actions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">As I said before, under the U.S. rules, which are proposed, we\u2019re at 5% for the hold co and 6% for the bank. We had time obviously in the quarter to analyze the proposed rule. And again, I caveat this that it\u2019s a proposed rule, will likely change. And of course, it\u2019s not effective until 2018. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">But I think you should assume that that\u2019s a somewhat conservative estimate, the 5% and the 6%, and in terms of mitigating actions, too early for us to really be thinking heavily about mitigating actions. We want to see how the rule evolves. We\u2019ll engage the regulators. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">And the way we incorporate this, for a lack of better language, it will be how we incorporate this into our toolkit will be no different than we do with other regulatory metrics. Just like we talked about at your conference earlier in the year, which is actually rolling out some sample tools has proved to be fortuitous in terms of giving people an example of how we\u2019ll deploy it. But it\u2019s pretty early in the process. We\u2019ll see how it evolves. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Your next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with ISI. Please go ahead. </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Maybe we could talk about I&amp;L for a second. I wonder if you could provide any update on capital and RWA in I&amp;L, not sure if you feel like breaking out equity versus MES. But I\u2019m thinking down the process of, is there a natural annual runoff rate or realization rate in I&amp;L, and if all that capital generation that you have, if you\u2019re finding opportunities to reinvest it back in? </p>", "<p class=\"p p5\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p5\">Really excellent question. We haven\u2019t broken down and disclosed the allocation by those segments in terms of the capital. And I think it\u2019s clear if we think about the capital allocation in terms of sort of the conventional market credit, etc. In terms of the way we\u2019re managing the capital deployment, as you\u2019ve seen, we\u2019ve been in somewhat of a harvesting mode, because that\u2019s what the market opportunity has provided. As we\u2019ve talked about before, we\u2019ve stayed very disciplined in terms of return characteristics. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">As it relates to capital itself, as you know, the investments in funds are deductions from capital under the Basel III ratios. Now, there are transitional provisions, so for example under the transitional provisions, our Basel III capital ratio would be about 100 basis points higher than the 9.8, but I\u2019ve been quoting you the fully loaded. That is the way I would think about it.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">So from that standpoint, given that the market\u2019s providing you harvest opportunities, but not the same level of investing opportunities, there is a natural runoff. I don\u2019t want to put words in your mouth, but the production of the business unit or line item in general has been great, but there should be some natural shrinkage until there\u2019s a reinvestment mode. Is that not a right way to think about it?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">I would think about it no differently than we\u2019ve approached it in the past, which is there will be cycles when reinvestment opportunities for us and our clients seem more attractive, and there will be parts of the cycle where harvesting is more attractive. We happen to be slightly more in a harvesting cycle. But recently, actually, we\u2019ve seen some good investment opportunities. They tend to be a bit more geographically based, given some of the geographic differences and stress around the world. But that\u2019s no different in terms of philosophy and I think the way to think about how we operate the business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Just shifting gears for a second, you just alluded to Howard\u2019s question a little bit, but just curious, the biggest users of gross balance sheet within FIC, and you guys were early and pushing down Basel III requirements out on to the desk. Is it way early on leverage? I\u2019m just curious on how the leverage focus even is going to start impacting yours and others\u2019 balance sheets.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Again, too early to tell in terms of how we\u2019ll incorporate it as an operating metric. But at this stage, based on what we know - again, I want to be really careful about the caveats here, because this is an evolving rule - a couple of things. One, based on what we know about the rule, something that we\u2019ll be able to incorporate again into this toolkit. And separately, remember again, of course, it\u2019s effective in 2018. So in terms of capital planning, given we\u2019re at 5% and 6%, again under the proposal, it could change. Right now, I see it as something that we\u2019ll digest into our processes no differently than other rules have.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Last quickie, the Basel III numbers you gave, is that standardized or advanced? What\u2019s the spread between the two?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">That\u2019s a good question. So, Basel III, again, fully loaded, was 9.8. Standardized is approximately 9.1. So lower than obviously the advanced. And again, referring to the transitional provisions, I\u2019m giving you fully loaded, as though we\u2019re standing many years out into the future. They\u2019re both about 100 basis points higher with the provisions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">And just target-wise, we should be thinking of the 7 plus the 2.5, plus a little buffer?</p>", "<p class=\"p p6\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">Yeah, you know, we\u2019d announced a buffer of 100 basis points and targeting around 9.5. We\u2019re now living<strong> </strong>with the metric. We\u2019re not too wedded to that particular number. I think the way I would describe it strategically is we want to run with enough capital first and foremost to position the firm defensively. We want to be in an exceptionally strong capital position. </p>", "<p class=\"p p6\">But also obviously the flipside of that is we really always want to be in a position so we can make capital to our clients. And it\u2019s been an environment, for the last couple of years, which has been trending better, but I wouldn\u2019t call it a first-quartile client opportunity set. And so we\u2019re moving across. And to be clear, it\u2019s 1.5, not 2.5.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Your next question is from the line of Roger Freeman with Barclays. Please go ahead. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Roger Freeman - Barclays</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">So I guess coming back to the FICC business, just broadly speaking, and you talk about client activity, client volumes, positioning, and then there\u2019s also sort of the factor of market liquidity, which ties across it too, but your ability to sort of trade around positions. If you kind of think about the impacts broadly on the third quarter, where would you sort of rate those three things? Just trying to think about the balance of the impacts.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Well, as I said before, I think from a client activity perspective, when we look at all those metrics, all that looks quite positive. So I don\u2019t think that was an impact at all. Liquidity is always a factor in markets, where you\u2019re in the summer, there\u2019s a fair bit of uncertainty. I wouldn\u2019t overweight it. Again, the shift from the second quarter to the third quarter, we just didn\u2019t execute as well as we would have liked to. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Roger Freeman - Barclays </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And what\u2019s your sense of how the market environment going forward here, with a whole evening to digest the deal in Washington last night, punting to January, do you think this is a headwind for client risk taking? Or a relief? Or what?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">Well, certainly a relief. We\u2019ll see how people digest what the events look like coming into the first quarter. But certainly to the extent to which our clients, which are evaluating transactions, whether it\u2019s mergers, debt-equity activity, institutional clients\u2026 </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">You know, one good thing about the crisis is it\u2019s made everybody focus on [tail] risk. And even though, as we came into the debt ceiling negotiations, while I think you could have argued maybe the tail risk was maybe quite low, the world and all of our clients are very respective of tail risk. It\u2019s much easier to do nothing than it is to do something. S</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">o in the short term, got to think having this removed from the marketplace is quite good. The longer term solutions, sort of the continued path back to normalcy, if you will, which I think we\u2019ve been marching along pretty steadily, but it\u2019s been kind of a two or three steps forward, one step back, I think getting to a point where we\u2019re just in a comfortable stride as a global economy, the long term\u2019s quite important, obviously. </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Roger Freeman - Barclays </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">And then on I&amp;L, coming back to Glenn\u2019s question, if you think about a future investing cycle, and factoring in the deductions to capital under the new framework, what do you think, and it might be too hard to answer here, but what kind of return hurdles would make that worthwhile? And do you think private equity, like investments, where those firms target 20% plus returns, with that kind of an outlook, is that still viable with the capital holdbacks on this? </p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">There have always been very high requirements to utilize the balance sheet for multiyear capital commitments. And those would be more than enough to be beyond the [unintelligible] of specific capital requirements. So that\u2019s not a concern. So that\u2019s a factor that I\u2019m not worried about. As I said, what we\u2019re really seeing is more of the cyclical back and forth.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">But you know, in some respects, and we\u2019ve talked about this before, you either get good new investing opportunities or you get the opportunity to deploy the capital into other businesses, or you can return the capital.</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Roger Freeman - Barclays </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">On commodities, what does it take, in your mind, to get that business getting, I guess, back to some sort of normalcy? It\u2019s just been challenging for you and others. Can this work inside of a broker-dealer with the capital [unintelligible] rules still to be determined?</p>", "<p class=\"p p7\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p7\">I would maybe add to your question a little bit. So, the commodity environment has been a little bit difficult. Low volatility and obviously impacted by the macro backdrop. But just to specifically get to your question, the commodity business for us, as you know, we\u2019ve been in the business for 30-plus years. It\u2019s been a central business for our clients. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">The nature of the activity is we\u2019re on the phone with CEOs, CFOs, treasurers. The nature of the business itself, in terms of their objectives, is no different than it would be, for example, for a retailer. It\u2019s about hedging, it\u2019s about managing revenue, it\u2019s about financing activities, timing of cash flows. For example, it\u2019s very akin to receivables financing for a retailer, or managing their expense base for a consumer of commodities. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Those are all normal corporate treasury functions that we perform now with clients for 30 years. And we\u2019ll see what happens in the regulatory discussion. It\u2019s an important discussion, but it\u2019s not distracting us from the focus on our clients. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">You had a comment that in September you saw a pickup on the investment banking side, and we can clearly see that. I guess just anything on maybe the FICC side, just given the environment in the third quarter, versus what you\u2019re seeing now. There\u2019s still some obviously macro uncertainty, but just any color. I know you guys don\u2019t tend to give too much color in terms of the current quarter, and it\u2019s only a short period of time, but any trends that have been different September and October?</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">Again, you had the July and August normal seasonal slowdown, and then of course you had a pickup in September. But activity from the client base was picking up pretty much really broadly in the early part of September, but then of course people got very focused on the government debate.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">So there really wasn\u2019t a chance for people to shift into what I\u2019ll call a mode where they had more conviction. It was still an environment of uncertainty. But I guess if I had to really sort of slice it for you, I\u2019d say certainly there was a seasonal pickup after August, with kind of this backdrop of uncertainty, which fortunately, at least for a while, is behind us this morning.</p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">And then maybe as we head into next year, and you look at the FICC business, it seems like we\u2019ve kind of gone through this clearing portion in the OTC markets with no big issues. It\u2019s run relatively smoothly. The SEF, it seems like it\u2019s a bigger implementation project for the entire industry. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">If we start looking at February as an important timeline, based on the different scenarios that can play out, meaning they work, they partially work, it\u2019s a complete mess, how do you think it impacts the FICC business heading into 2014 and beyond, and particularly heading into that? Are clients still going to be transacting? Do you think volumes are a bit weak? Just any color on that. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">We were, as you know, big supporters of clearing. And I\u2019ll give the market and the regulators really high marks on our clients. A huge amount of work went in by all participants, as you noted, to get clearing off. It was really uneventful, as it should have been, and I think the three stages of client introduction to clearing were quite thoughtful. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">As you pointed out, with kind of the launch of SEF, it was harder. There\u2019s a lot of infrastructure, and it\u2019s complicated for clients, various rule sets. And so it\u2019s going to take a lot of work, from everyone in the industry, regulators, SEF operators, market participants like Goldman Sachs, all of our clients, who have a deep, vested interest in getting this right, to be active in that dialog between now and the spring to really work out all of the issues. </p>", "<p class=\"p p8\">I don\u2019t think you can read too much into the October launch of Swap Execution Facilities other than there\u2019s a lot of work to do. And I think the regulators were quite thoughtful in pushing out some of the decisions to November 1. Then of course we had the government shutdown, so they haven\u2019t been there to focus on it. But we\u2019re going to all have to pay a lot of attention to this. I don\u2019t think we can, as market participants - and when I say \u201cwe\u201d I don\u2019t mean Goldman Sachs, I mean all of us - we can\u2019t afford to have a total mess. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an option that we should all accept. If it takes longer to get it in place, just like it took longer to get clearing in place, that\u2019s what we should do. It\u2019s just too important for our clients and for the industry. So it will be a big focus over the next couple of months. But there is a lot of work to do. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And then just finally, you guys haven\u2019t said any new, like, ROE or return on tangible equity targets. Obviously there\u2019s still a lot of uncertainty in terms of the rules. When you do look at it in terms of what management, the board wants to generate in terms of return that makes sense, and you\u2019ve been maneuvering, whether it\u2019s on the revenue side, the expense side, comp this quarter, what is still an adequate return between now and when we get clarity? Because obviously once we get clarity then you can make more strategic moves. But just trying to understand, it\u2019s been a fairly long time horizon in terms of we haven\u2019t gotten the rules, and so in this interim, before you can kind of set out that new cross-cycle target, something in the interim?</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">With respect to returns, this is what I would say. Strategically, the way we\u2019re managing the firm is, as we\u2019ve talked about, it\u2019s for the long run. So it\u2019s for the long run positioning. Now, having said that, we\u2019re very sensitive to components of the cycle. And as you point out, this has been a slightly longer cycle. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">So the simplified Cliff\u2019s Notes version of strategy for the firm over the past several years has been 1) extreme focus on the clients globally, 2) to make sure that while maintaining that focus that we\u2019re also managing the cost base, which is why a couple of years ago we announced the multiple series of cost reductions which brought it down roughly $2 billion, and then, along with that, a whole host of efficiency efforts. That\u2019s all been designed to create operating leverage. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And so we feel like we\u2019re really really well-positioned from an operating leverage perspective. We just need to move back to a market environment that, as I said earlier, is not two or three steps forward, one step back, because that\u2019s really what our clients will need to feel a sense of conviction. And then you get back to more of a run rate.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Now, the rule uncertainty is still pretty significant. And as we digest the rules, we\u2019ll certainly be evaluating them in the context of an overall ROE target. What I would say, because I don\u2019t want you to get off the call without this message, things that are going to be on the balance sheets for multiple years, we are still just as disappointed as we always have been. There\u2019s no change to those return hurdles. And we\u2019re exquisitely focused on that. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">Your next question is from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">If I could just drill into the equity trading business a little bit. I guess if we ex the reinsurance and DVA both periods it seems like it\u2019s down about 10% year over year. And I realize the base is always tricky, but the three universal banks that have reported so far have been showing up anywhere from 20% to 35%. So any additional color there would be helpful. </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">There\u2019s ins and outs, as you pointed out, year over year. Last year, of course, we facilitated the Knight transaction, which was obviously a component of revenues last year. And so there\u2019s back and forth, sort of ins and outs. I think when you sum it all up, really what you do is you get to a number that\u2019s more flat.</p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">And then just on the expense side, as we think about noncomp costs and litigation, just thoughts on those two going forward? </p>", "<p class=\"p p9\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p9\">On noncomp, as I said, a big part of the strategy, particularly in this environment, which is very news sensitive from a client activity level, we\u2019re staying very vigilant on noncomp. And just as we have in the past, you obviously would have seen in the earnings release we accrued $142 million for litigation reserve this quarter, $149 million last quarter. We\u2019re evaluating all the normal inputs we would with respect to litigation expense and reserving it quarterly.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And just lastly, on the comp, and I think you had said this in the prepared remarks, but making some of the adjustments that you normally do in Q4 this quarter, should we think about kind of a more straight line approach in Q4? So if we look at the year to date comp level, about 41%, is that a good starting point as we think about a fourth quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We\u2019ll get to compensation in the fourth quarter when we get to it. I more or less went through all the components of how we thought about compensation philosophically, which is no change. So it\u2019s our best estimate, but it also reflects the fact that on a year to date revenue basis, we\u2019re running $500 million ahead. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">A couple of questions. One is just on the comp ratio. I know you talked about it a little bit earlier, but in the past, I know you\u2019ve paid on all revenues. Is that still the same approach you are taking? I just wanted to clarify that, because as was mentioned earlier, the ratio coming down in the third quarter is a little unusual.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Yeah, no, I think it\u2019s our lowest accrual for nine months. But it reflects, as it always has, the collection of businesses across the firm. And I won\u2019t bore everybody with all the other components in terms of our processes, but again, it\u2019s our best estimate.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And then on the FICC, just a little bit of a cleanup question. You indicated the challenging macro-environment obviously. I\u2019m just thinking, from a competitive positioning standpoint, obviously underwriting can tend to be important as to how you are able to generate trading revenues over the course of the quarter. And do you feel like there was any reason that you might have been behind competitors, because you weren\u2019t involved in all of the high-profile deals that were out this quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">There are certain large transactions, obviously, where we were on one side of a transaction versus others. But that\u2019s going to be in the normal mix of business. And so some quarters we\u2019ll be a big, dominant participant, and other quarters [unintelligible]. But over the cycle, as you know, you\u2019ll see us be involved in most of the significant transactions.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And then the other question has to do with the SLR. You\u2019ve talked a lot about the [unintelligible] and the Basel common tier one ratio, so I got that. So I\u2019m just wondering, on the SLR side, is that also fully loaded?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Well, yes, you should think of it as fully loaded.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">And I know there\u2019s a couple of different ways that you can calculate derivatives. Which way are you guys choosing to do that right now?</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">We\u2019re just following the rules as we understand them. There\u2019s no difference in terms of different alternatives. But we\u2019re happy to discuss it with you more offline.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Okay. No, I\u2019m just wondering about the CEM approach, or not. I wasn\u2019t sure which one you\u2019re choosing.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Sorry, the CEM approach. Earnings [unintelligible] methodology, for anyone on the call who\u2019s not familiar with the shorthand. </p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong> </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">Your next question is from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer &amp; Company. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p10\"><strong>Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer &amp; Company </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p10\">There\u2019s been a lot in the press about how the regulators and the government officials want banks to divest their physical commodities business. There was another article in the Journal this morning. And I wonder if you can talk a little bit about A) how critical is the physical commodities business to the whole of your commodities business and B) if, hypothetically, there were a sale or divestiture of the physical business, does that free up capital above and beyond whatever proceeds you would realize, meaning does the physical commodity business come with meaningful RWAs or other operational risks or charges or things like that?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">So we haven\u2019t disclosed any specifics around risk-weighted assets or capital associated with physical commodities. The business for us, overly simplified, really splits into two parts. One, there\u2019s investments that we own. And then there\u2019s the franchise, which I talked a bit more about in an earlier question. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">As it relates to investments that we own, they\u2019re on a normal lifecycle where we would intend to hold them for years. As it relates to the commodities franchise, the extent to which we\u2019re involved in the physical business is the extent to which our clients need us to be involved in the physical business because in commodities, which is a bit different from other businesses, obviously, they need to, many times, receive delivery. And so we could be arranged in that. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Very often, though, under those types of transactions, we are not the holder of title, or may be the holder of title. But it\u2019s important from the standpoint of being able to fulfill those earlier requirements that clients have, hedging, financing, etc. But that\u2019s how I would, very high level, split out the way the physical aspect of our business is part of our strategy, if you will. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer &amp; Company </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Okay, so it\u2019s important to you?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Well, it\u2019s important to our clients, so by extension it\u2019s important to us. Now, we have a long, long investment in the commodity business, and we have, at this stage, no intention of selling our business. We\u2019re very committed to our clients here. And so we\u2019ll just work with the regulators. But ultimately the regulators will come to their own opinion about the business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead. </p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Can you size the investment banking backlog? You said it\u2019s the largest in five years.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">No, we don\u2019t size it, but it\u2019s a pretty significant move up, as I said. I\u2019ll give you a little bit of color. It\u2019s more significant in equity underwriting and in the advisory side of the business.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">And then back to FICC, we\u2019ve heard a lot of reasons why FICC was weak, and you said you\u2019re not happy with it. And I\u2019m still trying to get my arms around it. You said it\u2019s activity, it\u2019s seasonal, it\u2019s Washington, DC, it\u2019s macro. You said for currencies it\u2019s lower VAR and inventory, commodities market making. Credit, it\u2019s volumes. Mortgage, it\u2019s tapering. So let me just ask a real simple question. Do you think the decline in FICC that you\u2019re not happy with is a one-quarter blip, or that some of those factors should continue?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">It\u2019s just a quarter, Mike. And those factors, obviously, the marketplace has to do with a lot of those factors too, which is why I say we\u2019re not happy with it. But it\u2019s a quarter. We have a very strong FICC franchise, and that\u2019s why I highlighted earlier we react to these things and we\u2019re very data-focused, but when we look into, for example, all the indicators of client activity, it\u2019s just a quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">Well, a follow up to that. Is any of the decline related to how you\u2019re managing the business differently, whether it\u2019s the balance sheet - I know the rules don\u2019t take effect until 2018, but you can take actions now - or the business, due to some regulatory changes, which you\u2019ve talked about, or even how you empower the traders to manage around risk-weighted assets more?</p>", "<p class=\"p p11\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p11\">No, not that we can see. For example, look at the second quarter and the first quarter. There was no rule implementation or change in management in terms of the way we think about ratios or the proposed supplementary leverage ratio that would have affected the way we run the business - and this is a really important strategic takeaway - on July 1, and the way we\u2019d run it on June 30. Just not a great quarter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">I know you haven\u2019t disclosed this before, but can you give us some detail on FICC, what are the revenues for currencies, commodities, credit, and mortgage, from the second to the third quarter? </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Not beyond what I covered in my opening comments. I highlighted currencies. I think it\u2019s a good example of where we had some challenges. You know, look, year over year I think we have a bigger mortgage business than some other folks, and so you\u2019ll recall last year we were coming into the environment of QE, and so appetite from clients was significantly greater in mortgages. But I more or less covered it in my prepared remarks. </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question is from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Just wanted to focus a little bit on the inflows you talked about in assets under management, specifically in the $12 billion in fixed income. Can you provide a little more color on what those assets were and sort of your thinking about how that trajectory could continue into the fourth quarter?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">In terms of those assets, this is a bit of just the result of our strategy, and I want to sound old-fashioned on this, because there\u2019s nothing new here. This is just continued focus on performance. And the fixed income team has done a good job in performance. In terms of flows and broadly speaking where they came from, the flows were diversified. Institutional also from our private wealth franchise, which has had a long, long record now, multiquarter record, of inflows. But really it\u2019s kind of old-fashioned. Nothing new, just performance.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And are the flows generally focused in lower yielding fixed income assets, or slightly higher yielding fixed income assets?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">It\u2019s a mix. But quite frankly I don\u2019t have that detail with me. I\u2019d be happy to have Dane and Heather follow up with you afterwards. But my recollection is it\u2019s a mix.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And then just secondarily, the quarter end balances for the GCE were down a little bit, and granted maybe I\u2019m making too much of this, but I guess I\u2019m just curious as to why those were down, as you ended the quarter, given that we\u2019ve heard from a number of clients that they were increasing their liquidity as a result of some of the macro issues in DC.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">If you look at the last two quarters, you\u2019ll see second quarter I think we averaged 180, and then we finished at 183, so there was liquidity building up towards the end of the quarter. In a quiet market environment, you\u2019ll see us generally - not always, of course, but generally - build liquidity. And so you\u2019ll see that the average for the quarter was even higher than the endpoint of June. The average was 187. There were just individual one-off things that utilized liquidity at the end of the quarter as part of our franchise.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">And just finally, you talked about this a little bit in terms of the commodity VAR, but overall with the VAR being about $84 million for the quarter, up a little bit quarter over quarter, I guess I\u2019m just curious if the change quarter over quarter was as much due to market volatility, or is that just your positioning within the individual risk categories?</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">It was more due to volatility over the quarter. If you look, for example, in currencies, the decline was, as I mentioned earlier, more related to positions. Same with most of the other businesses. Rates was a little bit the other way, but not much.</p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Your next question is from the line of Kian Abouhossein with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. </p>", "<p class=\"p p12\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JPMorgan</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p12\">Starting with leverage, I\u2019m more interested in the Basel III proposal leverage, and I was wondering if you could give us also some indication how your leverage ratio would look like under the Basel III proposal which came out recently. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">It\u2019s just a proposal, so we\u2019re in the proposal phase on that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JPMorgan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">What are the issues that you see as nonworkable or, let\u2019s put it differently, in terms of concerns within the Basel III proposal relative to what you see from the U.S. proposal?</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I wouldn\u2019t want to draw a lot of distinctions between the two proposals. There are certain things that the industry broadly, and obviously you can check, we submitted a letter. I would say collateral for one, the treatment of collateral. I think at the highest level, we like metrics, and I think a leverage ratio can play a valuable role in a suite of metrics. I just think, like all metrics collectively, whether it\u2019s the U.S. rule or the Basel III proposal, I think we all, as market participants, always need to be focused on any unintended consequences. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">So the things that we\u2019re most focused on are things like liquidity pools and how they\u2019re incorporated into metrics. Because we just generally don\u2019t think people should be incented to hold liquidity at the regulatory minimums. And that might not happen tomorrow, but these rules will be in place for a very, very long time, and so we need to incorporate them that way. But as I said, collateral will be one thing that we would be focused on on the Basel III. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JPMorgan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">And credit derivative notional hedging, is that something where you feel quite comfortable with the Basel III guidelines and the proposal that you could meet a lot of [netting], or do you think that\u2019s something that you would have to change the way you hedge your positions in order to justify the netting under the proposal. </p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">It\u2019s very early to be thinking about responding to these. So, again, let\u2019s start high-level. So, getting gross notional down, it\u2019s a good thing. It\u2019s clean living. Gross notionals certainly can create risk, but not risk in the sense of the way that we think about market risk, and I\u2019m not talking about the market risk in an RWA sense. I\u2019m talking about risk in the marketplace.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I think that the focus on gross notionals is an important one, but I think, again, this is difficult, but I think what you would see the industry do is get very focused on collapsing gross notionals. To date, when the industry comes together to focus on gross notionals, obviously everyone\u2019s focused on the economics. I think you could see people be more open to the economic cost of shrinking gross notionals. But all this is included in our letter.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JPMorgan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">Moving towards the results, just I wanted to come back to FICC. If I look at the percentage decline that some of your peers have shown so far in this quarter, and as I even make an adjustment additionally considering you may be slightly more impacted due to your being more over credit [unintelligible], I calculate that the potential inventory FX impact could be around $500 million in terms of impacting your results. I\u2019m just trying to understand the material decline here in your FICC results, and I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s something that I\u2019m doing incorrectly, looking at it from this perspective of looking at [peer seasonality] giving you slightly more of a decline due to your mix, and then assuming the rest is FX inventory related.</p>", "<p class=\"p p13\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p13\">I think it\u2019s a little complicated to compare, in an individual quarter, if we\u2019re down a certain percentage and our competitors are down a certain perspective and really take a lot of information away from that. Now, obviously it\u2019s important, but I think trying to draw conclusions on the math is harder, so I don\u2019t know that I can give you any more information as we talked about. I think to sum it up we had a tougher quarter. By the way, we will have quarters where we will have outperformance, and we will have tough quarters. This will be a tough one.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JPMorgan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">But why would you have FX inventory in the first place, a very liquid market. I understand you run your FX with your EM business together. Just trying to understand what are the positions that would hold inventory on behalf of clients.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">As you would perfectly understand, I\u2019m not going to get into the details about specific positions. But as I said, you can see it in the VAR profile, the derisking, but I can\u2019t give you any more color than that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JPMorgan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Last question on this, then. Are the positions that you had in the inventory actually sold, or are they hedged?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I think you\u2019re misunderstanding my message at this point. There are no core positions that are something that are a significant concern. It sounded like that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking. I won\u2019t talk about how we manage the risk.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Kian Abouhossein - JPMorgan </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Yes, that\u2019s what I\u2019m more interested in, if you still have some notional on the books, or you actually sold the notional. </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">No, I didn\u2019t answer the question, actually.</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Your next question is from the line of Douglas Sipkin with Susquehanna. Please go ahead. </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">I just wanted to follow up a little bit, drilling down on the [iBank] pipeline. Just given the commentary around the trading environment and uncertainty, I\u2019m just trying to reconcile that with the five-year record pipeline, which would require CEO confidence to do things with M&amp;A and equity. So maybe you can sort of relate the two back. While it\u2019s great, it just seems like it\u2019s abnormally high for the environment that we\u2019re in to have such a high pipeline. What exactly are you guys seeing? What\u2019s happening that it\u2019s so big, given the uncertain environment that we\u2019re in?</p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">It\u2019s a great question. As you know, the dialog around M&amp;A activity and financing activity, but M&amp;A activity in particular, it\u2019s a very very long lifecycle dialog. And if we had one of our merger bankers in the room, very often, in a particular transaction, not just a client, but the particular transaction could be under discussion for multiple years. In an environment with very high uncertainty, which is a low-conviction environment, obviously, then transactions tend to get delayed. </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">So it\u2019s not one of these things that turns on or off like a light switch. So nobody blows the all clear whistle. But I would say there\u2019s certainly a desire in the corporate base to produce growth, and when they see strong underlying synergies, people will take action, but they need a backdrop in which they feel comfortable executing. And as I said, the trend in terms of the backdrop, regardless of the fact that this quarter there might have been a step back in terms of confidence and an increase in uncertainty, the trend is positive. But this is a multiyear phenomenon, obviously. </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Shifting gears, maybe you could just spend a little bit more on the asset management business. Maybe big picture, just from my vantage point, it seems like you guys are doing a little bit more to buy, build, etc. there. Do you guys have any long term targets as to how big you want that business to be relative to the whole organization? Obviously it\u2019s a capital light business. I know you guys have done some smaller acquisitions here recently. So any color on strategic steps you guys are taking there that are different from maybe three, five years ago? </p>", "<p class=\"p p14\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p14\">Well, the focus has been very intense for several years. But as I said before, it\u2019s a bit old-fashioned. The primary focus is performance, and with performance we know we will build assets. We\u2019ll look, from time to time, at acquisitions, if we think they make strategic sense and it fits our business, and it\u2019s additive to our clients and to our performance. But as I said, we\u2019re very pleased with the results in the growth, but we\u2019re relying on something that\u2019s a little bit old-fashioned. </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question is from the line of Fiona Swaffield with RBC. Please go ahead. </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Fiona Swaffield - RBC Capital Markets</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">I just had a follow up question on the Basel III all-in look through number, I think the 9.8 versus the 9.3. Could you talk us through, it looks to me like the deductions have gone down, because obviously you\u2019ve got buybacks offsetting profit or more than offsetting profit. And I think the [unintelligible] you said were down $10 billion. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong. But is there something going on in deductions? Or something else?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">You\u2019ll recall at the end of the second quarter obviously we got the finalized rule. One of the things about that rule, obviously, is there\u2019s the financial institutions deduction. What you\u2019re really seeing is a reduction in a component of that risk, which isn\u2019t a deduction from capital, as you know. And we\u2019ve talked about this before. The fact that our teams have both the tools and the ability to manage the balance sheets, what you\u2019re seeing now that we\u2019ve seen the finalized rule is you\u2019re seeing them take actions that affect the ratio. So, for example, selling certain cash assets. </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Fiona Swaffield - RBC Capital Markets </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">So it\u2019s not private equity deductions, per se, it\u2019s the other deductions?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">No. You\u2019re bringing up the subtlety of the significant versus the nonsignificant. And for anyone else on the call who\u2019s less fluent in this minutiae, I\u2019m happy to set up some follow up time with Dane and the team. The significant deductions obviously they will come with harvesting over time. Because we\u2019re in the funds with our clients.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Your next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Just a question on the investing and lending, the equity side. So the language that you used in the press release and I think you also said in your prepared remarks sort of made a distinction between corporate performance and company specific events. Could we generally think in our mind that the corporate performance ones are probably marks to a model, and then the company-specific events are more going to be either realized gains or marks to a market value that\u2019s visible?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">What I was referring to in the opening remarks, obviously, is public market equities versus private equities. And we\u2019re very rigorous, as you know, in our mark-to-market policies. So we incorporate all variables. I\u2019ll list a few. Obviously specific performance of the asset, which we have visibility into, and the market environment and pending events. So if, for example, we think an asset is going to go public in the next quarter, potentially, that\u2019s the strategic plan for the enterprise, or a subsequent quarter, if that\u2019s there, then we\u2019ll have other valuation techniques, which we\u2019re in receipt of, obviously. But it\u2019s a very rigorous process, as you know. </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"> </p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Oh, yeah. I don\u2019t doubt that at all. Is there any color that you can give us on the gains that you recognized in the quarter, how much of that was actually a realized gain versus some element of a mark?</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Well, it\u2019s all fair value, right? So I think if you\u2019re asking about specific monetizations, no, I haven\u2019t delineated that. But we\u2019re marking the balance sheet every day, as [unintelligible] is realized.</p>", "<p class=\"p p15\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p15\">Let me move on to the SLR. You\u2019re right, if the [unintelligible]\u2019s off, and you\u2019re already basically compliant, as you said. So you\u2019re not going to rush to do mitigation things. But you also had commented on the fact that compression and reduction of notionals was probably a healthy thing. So I\u2019m wondering to what extent you\u2019re engaged in more compression, more maybe looking to redocument existing transactions that are long term in nature into central clearing so you can get rid of the CVA drag on the denominator, the leverage ratio, things like that.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So again, just from a risk management perspective, we\u2019ve always been very engaged in trying to reduce gross notionals. As I said, it\u2019s just a good way to run the business. Now, because of the developing rule sets, the whole marketplace is more engaged, and we\u2019re very engaged. And that\u2019s not to imply people weren\u2019t as engaged as we are. </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">The nuance I was trying to explain earlier was that people historically, over many, many years, everyone likes to reduce gross notionals, but sometimes couldn\u2019t agree on cost. Now, there\u2019s just a greater forcing function, so there\u2019s more of a tailwind to everybody reducing gross notionals. </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Now, again, this is a little bit of the process of, I think, how we certainly - I suspect the rest of the industry - the leverage ratio, what it encourages you to do is to basically rank the exposures basically from a return on asset perspective, start with low ones, and mitigate from there. And this would be high on the list for the whole industry, I assume. </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">So I guess that I could interpret your remarks to mean that you probably are spending quite a bit more time and hopefully getting more resolutions when you\u2019re sitting across a table from a counterparty who\u2019s another dealer and getting these notionals down and maybe moving some of these elongated transactions, as I said, into a central clearing environment? Or does that not really work that well?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">That\u2019s a correct assessment, but it\u2019s just started. We just started, and the industry just started, so it\u2019s early going. But the answer is yes.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Fair enough. Like I said, I was just trying to get a sense for the direction of travel in that. And then just a final question on the intersection of the I&amp;L business and the comp ratio reduction. I know you\u2019ve generally had this policy of straight lining it for three quarters, but isn\u2019t it economically logical to conclude that the reason that the ratio came down as much as it did is just the degree to which your profit mix this quarter was driven by investing and lending activities that really have inherently a very low compensation ratio?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Again, no change in philosophy. I want to be really clear with everyone. It\u2019s our best estimate. It reflects the collective contribution of all businesses, certainly not an individual business segment. And we have reduced before in the third quarter. So it\u2019s not completely out of sync would have what we\u2019ve done historically, but it does reflect all these things I talked about earlier, the fact that we\u2019re running $500 million ahead, we have more visibility into year-end - which is another way of saying best estimate. We have more visibility into year-end, and of course the cost reduction efforts give us flexibility.</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. </p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Brennan Hawken - UBS </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">Just a quick one, at this point, and it\u2019s again on comp. Sorry. I hate to beat a dead horse, but just kind of want to take a slightly different angle on this. During earnings here we\u2019ve seen another dominant fixed franchise cut their comp ratio kind of materially this quarter too. And obviously you can\u2019t speak to the actions of a competitor, but in your view, is it appropriate to assume that as an industry we are maybe rationalizing FICC to a new regulatory and business environment through these actions?</p>", "<p class=\"p p16\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p16\">I have, as you know, zero visibility. You\u2019d have a lot more visibility in your engagement with our competitors than I would. Not to wax on and make the call long, but I remember the first day I showed up at Goldman Sachs. One of the first things I was taught and mentored was that compensation was first and foremost how the firm did, then how your division did, then how your business unit did, and then how you did as an individual. </p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">We haven\u2019t changed any of that. If anything, we\u2019re protective of that cultural mantra, and I hope that every new summer hire that we brought in this year, I hope they got the same lecture I had back then. So, again, it\u2019s the same culture, and you\u2019re just seeing it based on performance. And when I say performance, everything: the year to date run rate being ahead in revenues, and also all the multiyear efficiency efforts we\u2019ve built in. </p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Your next question is from the line of Christopher Wheeler with Mediobanca. Please go ahead. </p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Christopher Wheeler - Mediobanca </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">A couple of related questions. The first one really just touches on what the last gentleman said, because I suppose you\u2019ve been very, very honest about how difficult the quarter was for fixed income. But I guess we\u2019ve seen so many headwinds build up around fixed income since the crisis, and then during the summer we obviously saw the possible issues around tapering, which will come, of course, not just in the United States but elsewhere, where a lot of liquidity will come out of the market, interest rates go up. </p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And you guys have tended to be at the cutting edge of thinking through these issues, as you were post-crisis. And I suppose what I\u2019m interested in, and maybe compensation is one of the issues, but what else are you thinking about in terms of that withdrawal of liquidity, which may mean that if you want a market where fixed income revenues are not going to be anywhere near as robust as they were even in the post-crisis period, when you were having to deal with Basel III and the other capital issues?</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And I guess relating to that, perhaps linked to it, the 10.4% return on equity, I know you\u2019re not happy with that. You talked about the legacy assets. You\u2019ve always talked about when the markets pick up you will really perform very strongly, because of your clear strengths in the market. But I suppose when I look at some of your diversified competitors in the investment banking space, they are already moving towards the mid-teens. </p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">And I\u2019m just wondering again, given that you\u2019re normally at the front edge of these things, at what point do you start looking at the business model and enhancing it by looking to broaden it rather than actually perhaps narrow it, as you had to do with Dodd-Frank etc.? </p>", "<p class=\"p p17\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">Okay, that\u2019s a big question. So, in terms of fixed income, we don\u2019t really try and predict what happens in terms of the market reaction. And what I mean by predict, I mean over a multiyear period - and let\u2019s just say we go into a period of rising interest rates - a lot of what will determine the size of the market for fixed income - when I say that, I mean the activity levels for us and all of our competitors - won\u2019t be the absolute level of rates, it will be the backup of the environment. And so, again, an environment where it isn\u2019t so news-sensitive, and clients were high conviction, low conviction, and very nervous, is a much better environment for our clients, which, by the way, translates generally to better volumes in the marketplace and better liquidity for everyone.</p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">The best case history is really the equity business, which as you know went through a massive transformation from the late 90s to today, as an industry, and yet revenues continued to grow. So our responsibility to our clients and in running the business is how we adapt. </p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">So in the past we\u2019ve been good adapters, and we just have to continue to adapt. But the cornerstone of adapting will be the interface with the clients and making sure that we deliver to them. As we\u2019ve done in the past, we just need to continue doing it. But the changing interest rate environment, that will determine strategy over a multiyear period. </p>", "<p class=\"p p17\">As it relates to returns, look, we strive every day to ensure that we have the highest absolute returns while managing the firm conservatively. And we really want to make sure we have the highest relative returns. For us, this has been a good relative return environment. We\u2019d love to see better absolute returns, but it\u2019s been a pretty strong relative environment.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Christopher Wheeler - Mediobanca </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">We just talked about rising rates on taper, but [unintelligible] liquidity as well, which I think was one of the great fears that we\u2019ve just seen, and that does suggest the need to realign the business. And I think what you\u2019re saying is that you\u2019ll just keep an eye on that. You have no plans at the moment to do that in respect to something that hasn\u2019t actually started, albeit it will keep going for a long time, once tapering starts.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">What\u2019s critical about certain changes, or whether or not they change what clients need first, and then how it impacts market structure. I don\u2019t see anything in a rising rate environment that changes market structure. What will change is how clients view the marketplace. Again, if it\u2019s a high confidence, we\u2019re back to more certain economic growth, several years from now, and interest rates are higher, that could be a very positive environment for fixed income investors. But it might not be. All I know is we\u2019ll have to adapt and make sure we respond to it better than our competitors.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead. </p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Devin Ryan - JMP Securities</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">With respect to maybe some of the positive secondary impacts of regulation, could you maybe update us on which businesses you feel like you\u2019ve been gaining some market share in, and maybe where you\u2019re seeing some opportunities as competitors are just reevaluating their strategies or how they\u2019re allocating resources?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I think it\u2019s too early to see that. Obviously earlier in the year and continuing we\u2019ve seen some pullback from some competitors. I think that\u2019s a multiyear phenomenon as it relates to to impact of regulation. And so we\u2019ll see that again over time. That will be a big part about this operating flexibility that I was talking about earlier. </p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">The real differentiating characteristics firm by firm - and we all will live with the same rules, we\u2019ll have all the same resources - is which firm can better deliver to their clients and which firm can better adapt. And I\u2019ve talked about this a lot. Adapting too early can be a mistake, and adapting too late can be a mistake, and so we\u2019ll be watching it very, very closely and doing everything we can to deliver to our clients. </p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Devin Ryan - JMP Securities </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And then just lastly, not to beat a dead horse on FICC, but we have seen some flows out of bond funds in recent months, and understand they\u2019re small in the absolute, but just given your exposure to institutional asset managers, as you mentioned, did you see any change in client behavior in the quarter or anything that maybe was a little bit concerning just with some of the outflows out of bond funds?</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">It\u2019s been a while now, but obviously I grew up in that business, and I co-headed it before my current responsibilities. I think what clients did is just normal client risk management. Maybe a little different than what you would have seen pre-crisis, because people are just very, very sensitive to potential tail risk. Quite frankly I think it\u2019s a good thing for the marketplace, not a bad thing. But no, I think all the behavior was very predictable.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Operator</strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">And at this time, there are no further questions. Please go ahead with any closing remarks.</p>", "<p class=\"p p18\"><strong>Harvey Schwartz </strong></p>", "<p class=\"p p18\">I just want to thank you for joining today.
