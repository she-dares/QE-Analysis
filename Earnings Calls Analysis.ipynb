      "we've seen so many, what I would call, major public policy achievements compressed into a single year like we saw last year. And we're calling\n",
      "these achievements because the combined impact from these is going to be growth. It's going to be growth in U.S. investment, in jobs and in\n",
      "wages. And all of this began early in 2017 as regulations across all industries were being rationalized.\n",
      "In our industry specifically, the FCC returned us to a light-touch regulation of the Internet. And this was the approach that up until 2015 had allowed\n",
      "the Internet to flourish and the U.S. tech sector to lead the world in innovation. So we obviously believe this was a step in the right direction. But\n",
      "this regulatory pendulum is going to keep swinging back and forth unless Congress steps forward and writes new laws to govern all Internet\n",
      "companies and to protect the consumer.\n",
      "We believe that we need clarity. We need a long-term predictability on the rules of the Internet and on customer privacy. So we're calling for an\n",
      "Internet Bill of Rights. And you can expect us to take a leadership role on this as the discussion progresses.\n",
      "But unquestionably, the biggest development that came out of Washington last year was around tax reform. Our public policymakers pulled the\n",
      "greatest lever they had available to them to stimulate capital investment in job creation and wage growth. That lever was giving U.S. companies\n",
      "a competitive tax system, one that levels the playing field with the rest of the world. We're very early in the process, but you've seen it. Company\n",
      "after company is already announcing increased investment, hiring, wage increases and employee bonuses, and we were first out of the gate.\n",
      "We announced bonuses for more than 200,000 frontline employees and a voluntary medical plan contribution for a total of $1 billion. And we also\n",
      "increased our 2018 capital expenditures by another $1 billion.\n",
      "So while public policy stole a lot of the spotlight, we did make a lot of progress on several strategic initiatives last year. The most important is\n",
      "FirstNet, winning that FirstNet bid. And this was going to prove to be the foundation for taking wireless network performance to a completely new\n",
      "level. What we're doing is building a nationwide network with the latest technology. It's designed and it's hardened for America's first responders.\n",
      "And then that will be our foundation for broad 5G deployment.\n",
      "We're well underway with the build, including new sites in unserved or underserved rural parts of the country. We plan to deploy 40 megahertz of\n",
      "fallow spectrum that we've accumulated over the last few years along with the spectrum from FirstNet. And we'll also be deploying the millimeter\n",
      "wave spectrum from our FiberTower purchase, and this is going to give us a quantum leap in both capacity and performance.\n",
      "If we move to Mexico. I'm really pleased with how the team is executing. They're doing so well. We added 3 million customers in 2017. We also\n",
      "made great progress leading the industry in terms of software-defined networking: 55% of our network is now virtualized. And as a result, you're\n",
      "seeing our networking and our IT cost structure falling significantly.\n",
      "We also made progress moving our base of our high-value customers into multiproduct bundles, saving them money, driving down churn and\n",
      "earning more of their overall spend. And you can see the fruits of the strategy in our strong wireless performance this quarter and DIRECTV NOW's\n",
      "terrific first year in the market. Our fiber build continued to go strong. We now reach more than 7 million customer locations and expect to double\n",
      "that in the next 18 months.\n",
      "So that's a look at 2017. And what I want to do now is move forward to 2018 and talk about our priorities this year, and that's on Slide 5. And it's\n",
      "no surprise, our top priority for 2018 is closing our deal to acquire Time Warner. We were obviously surprised when the government decided to\n",
      "try and block the merger because it is a classic vertical merger between 2 companies that don't even compete with one another. And with 50 years\n",
      "of legal precedent, it's the type of business combination that the government has consistently approved with appropriate conditions.\n",
      "Now while we remain open to finding some reasonable solutions to address the government's concern, we do expect this case will ultimately be\n",
      "litigated in court. The trial date is set to begin March 19, and we remain very confident that we'll complete this merger.\n",
      "We're also going to be laser-focused in 2018 on building the world's premier gigabit network. And again, FirstNet, combined with our fiber and\n",
      "our 5G deployment, is giving us a powerful platform to accelerate our move into a gigabit world. And I got to tell you, I love our position here. We\n",
      "expect to be the first U.S. company to launch mobile 5G service by the end of this year, and our fixed 5G trials are also going very well.\n",

      "We're learning a lot. We're gaining great insights into making this product a very strong commercial offering. And then last week, the FCC issued\n",
      "an order that cleared the way for us to move forward with our acquisition of FiberTower and the vast majority of its millimeter wave spectrum\n",

      "think our customers are really going to like this. The experience is very good.\n",
      "And so then before year-end, we plan to launch the next-gen product in a home-centric configuration with a very thin hardware client. And just\n",
      "think about it this way, it's a very small, inexpensive streaming device plugged into your TV and then you connect it to any broadband service. It\n",
      "will be a voice-controlled user interface with an integrated search feature. And it will allow you to search across any streaming video service that\n",
      "you subscribe to. So it can be DIRECTV NOW, Netflix, Amazon, Hulu or even YouTube. It also gives you a premium live video experience in your\n",
      "home with the flexibility and the ease-of-use, what you would expect out of an OTT service.\n",
      "We're also ramping up our advertising and analytics business. This is being led by Brian Lesser, who joined us last quarter. I think he's one of the\n",
      "best minds in ad tech. We're really excited about this opportunity because advertisers have made it really clear to us that they're looking for a\n",
      "trusted option in premium video advertising, looking for an alternative to the current digital ad duopoly that can bring advertisers scale and deliver\n",
      "results that are transparent and brand-safe.\n",
      "Once Time Warner closes, we'll be well positioned to be that alternative. We think the entire industry -- advertisers, publishers and consumers --\n",
      "are more than ready for this alternative. And with Time Warner, we believe we'll have the right data, the right content and the right talent to build\n",
      "an automated advertising platform that can transform premium video and TV advertising.\n",
      "2018, we're also going to be focused further on Mexico. Our business there is going to continue to scale. We continue to move towards profitability.\n",
      "We have great momentum in the market, nearly doubling our subscriber base in the last 2-plus years. And our LTE build in Mexico is almost complete.\n",
      "And then finally, our industry-leading cost structure is proving to be a significant competitive advantage. We obsess over delivering the lowest\n",
      "cost per megabyte in the world, and we still have a lot of room to go. So that's kind of a synopsis of what we'll be focused on in 2018.\n",

      "The positive impact of tax reform led to some significant changes in both our reported fourth quarter and annual results. This impacted our balance\n",
      "sheet and fourth quarter earnings. It also led to us making some important decisions that impacted our fourth quarter cash flows.\n",
      "We'll walk through these impacts as we discuss the results. Revenues were essentially flat year-over-year as a strong quarter in wireless equipment\n",
      "and in our international operations mostly offset declines in legacy wireless and video services. Adjusted consolidated operating margins in the\n",
      "quarter were down year-over-year due to healthy increases in wireless sales and expenses from our Entertainment Group, offsetting, though, solid\n",
      "growth in our international operations. But for the full year, operating margins were up 40 basis points.\n",
      "In the fourth quarter, our adjusted EPS was $0.78, including a $0.13 positive impact from tax reform. Essentially, our ability to fully expense capital\n",
      "spending in the fourth quarter generated most of this benefit. Remember, tax reform expensing provisions were effective retroactively to September\n",

      "We also made a number of other decisions with regard to tax -- with tax reform in mind, including the $200 million in bonus payments to our\n",
      "frontline employees, an $800 million funding of our employee and retiree medical trusts, nearly $100 million funding of our AT&T Charitable\n",
      "Foundation and a number of other steps.\n",
      "Adjustments for the fourth quarter include these special items: a $20 billion gain from our preliminary estimate of net deferred tax liability reductions\n",
      "generated by the new tax law, asset write-offs in our copper plant as our consumer fiber footprint continues to expand and we continue to serve\n",
      "new customers with those fiber capabilities, and additional storm and natural disaster impacts. And in the fourth quarter, those are primarily from\n",
      "Puerto Rico. Other adjustments include our annual mark-to-market pension plan remeasurement and merger and integration costs, amortizations\n",
      "and some other adjustments.\n",
      "Free cash flow was up for the quarter and was $17.6 billion for the year, even with the $1 billion of benefit payments made in connection with tax\n",
      "reform. CapEx for the full year also came in on target at just under $22 billion. Let's now take a look at our operations, starting with mobility, where\n",
      "the team turned in outstanding customer growth. Those details are on Slide 8.\n",
      "AT&T's domestic mobility operations, as you know, are divided between the Business Solutions and customer wireless segments. For comparison\n",
      "purposes, the company is providing supplemental information for its total U.S. wireless operations, and that's what I'll discuss today.\n",
      "First off, we added 329,000 postpaid phone customers in the quarter, a significant increase on both the year-over-year and sequential basis. Postpaid\n",
      "smartphone net additions were even more at 400,000. Altogether, we had more than 2.7 million new subscribers with gains in postpaid, prepaid\n",
      "and connected devices. And looking at the full year, we added more than 2 million of our most valuable branded smartphone subscribers to our\n",
      "base.\n",
      "One big reason for this success is reduced churn. Postpaid phone churn continues to run at record levels, dropping to 0.89% in the quarter. Revenues\n",
      "were up in the quarter thanks to strong smartphone sales. These sales also had an impact on margins. We had a year-over-year increase of 700,000\n",
      "smartphone gross adds and upgrades in the quarter as our customers kept coming back and getting new phones.\n",
      "Our BOGO offer was also successful and helped drive this volume increase. This growth impacted margins. But with record low postpaid phone\n",
      "churn, these customers will provide financial benefits years into the future. With these and many other efforts, we expect service revenues to\n",
      "improve throughout the coming year and turn positive for the year.\n",
      "We take a disciplined approach in building our customer base. We'll continue to be keenly focused on cost management, but also look for efficient\n",
      "opportunities to reinvest in our customers and continue growing. Now let's take a look at our Entertainment Group results.\n",
      "Total video customers, IP broadband connections and bundles all grew. DIRECTV NOW had a tremendous customer growth in its first year of\n",
      "operation. The 368,000 net adds in the fourth quarter gives us nearly 1.2 million customers in service, and we believe the best is yet to come.\n",
      "As Randall mentioned, we're close to launching our second-generation platform. We're excited about the improved customer experience the\n",
      "platform will bring and the new revenue opportunities that will come along with it. These will include the cloud-based DVR, an additional video\n",
      "stream to the 2 we offer today and a more robust video-on-demand experience.\n",
      "You're also seeing us turn the corner with our broadband business. IP broadband gains continue to be robust even as the conversion of DSL\n",
      "customers to IP slows as the consumer DSL customer base dropped below 1 million. We added nearly 600,000 IP broadband customers during\n",

      "Now let's look at Business Solutions results on Slide 9. Wireless drove growth in our Business Solutions segment, but we also saw a sequential\n",

      "First, we derisked the existing debt portfolio by extending maturities, primarily beyond 10 years, as we prepare to close the Time Warner deal. And\n",

      "increasing shareholder equity by a like amount. This reform significantly improves our net debt to equity ratios as well as free cash flow and dividend\n",
      "coverage in future years.\n",

      "assets down to 7% from the current 7 3/4% assumption. All these measures have a profound impact on our financial position, and I would expect\n",

      "allowing the additional $1 billion in incremental investment in 2018, much of that targeted for fiber deployment. The lower tax rate is also expected\n",

      "will have an impact on our 2018 financials. We plan to move quickly with the build-out and the timing of FirstNet reimbursements could impact\n",
      "our 2018 free cash flow.\n",

      "reduced depreciation expense that will be generated by the copper abandonment that we recorded in the fourth quarter of '17.\n",
      "And finally, the new revenue recognition accounting standard will have a positive impact on our near-term financials. Several items will be impacted,\n",
      "but the biggest of these are deferral of commission expenses, which will increase profits in 2018; recharacterization of some service to equipment\n",
      "revenues for equipment that was provided with multiyear service contracts. This is expected to have an impact on service revenues, but not a\n",
      "material impact on total revenues or on profitability. And a netting of universal service and other regulatory fees against the related expense. This\n",
      "is expected to significantly reduce both revenues and expense, but have little impact on profits.\n",
      "We still have work to do on revenue recognition, but our initial estimate is $0.10 to $0.15 per share of positive EPS impact in 2018. Our results will\n",
      "differ from others because of our extensive Next program as well as our adoption of deferred installment accounting contemporaneous with our\n",

      "on Slide 12. On a stand-alone basis, excluding Time Warner, we expect adjusted EPS in the $3.50 range, as I said, inclusive of the items previously\n",

       "['And with that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions.', 'Question-and-Answer Session', 'Operator', '[Operator instructions.] And your first question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.', 'John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein ', 'I was wondering how youre feeling about some of the 2015 financial targets. If we look at the ROA target of 90 to 110 basis points in 2015, we look at this quarter at [59] basis points year to date, around 80, what do you see as the key driver to getting toward the 2015 goal?', 'John Gerspach ', 'As weve talked about, reducing the losses in Citi Holdings is certainly one of the key goals that we see driving us toward the goal of generating ROA of between 90 and 110 basis points in 2015. And wed also look for some modest amount of net income improvement coming out of Citicorp as well.', 'John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein ', \"On the Citicorp side, I guess the efficiency goal is part of those 2015 targets around mid-50s, I'd just call it 55. You had 61 this quarter on the efficiency ratio, and 57 year to date. So I guess that implies some additional savings to be realized or revenue growth? Can you talk about getting to those efficiency goals?\", 'John Gerspach ', 'Yeah, as we said when Mike laid out those efficiency goals back in March, the environment that we anticipated was low single digit growth in revenues, and I think thats pretty much the environment that weve seen, and certainly might expect to see in the near term.', 'So we do anticipate most of the contribution towards those efficiency targets to come out of the expense line. And, I think as youve seen, weve been delivering on the repositioning savings that we talked about after that fourth quarter reserve that we took last year, and we continue to try to find additional efficiency savings throughout the businesses.', 'John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein ', 'And just on that, you mentioned the incremental efficiency saves this quarter. Can you just remind us, if you tally up what you were shooting for with last years, I think it was 900 this year, where are you on that cumulatively?', 'John Gerspach ', 'As we said at the end of the second quarter, I walked everybody through where we were, and we said our estimate that was that youd see $300 million of the savings in the run rate in the fourth quarter. The $300 million, therefore, representing exactly what we had said we would get, which is a total annual save of $1.2 billion. And we had about $200 million of additional run rate savings to generate from the end of the second quarter. And as I mentioned, we generated about half of that, say $100 million, in the third quarter. So weve got about $100 million more to bake into our fourth quarter results.', 'John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein ', 'So we should look for that to kind of come off the 10.8 adjusted expense number, assuming a similar revenue environment?', 'John Gerspach ', 'If volumes and the environment stays the same, youll see the repositioning savings come through maybe partially offset by some incremental seasonal marketing expenses. So I dont want you to just take the 10.843 and take an even $100 off and get 10.743. The roundings could end up leaving us rounding at 10.8. But you should see the expenses come down, again, assuming the environment stays where it is.', 'John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein ', 'Understood. But thinking about next year, as we go from 2014 to 2015, it seems that if revenues arent going to get better, you would need to do more than 10.7, 10.8, or beyond the re-positioning saves youve announced for this year to get that efficiency ratio towards the 2015 target. So it seems reasonable to expect more saves, whether you announce them or not, in 2014?', 'John Gerspach ', 'Well, as I said, were going to be committed to delivering the efficiency targets as we laid out for 2015. And as you noted, year to date weve already got an efficiency ratio of 57% in Citicorp. So I think that weve already made a fair bit of progress this year in going from where we ended up in 2012. So I think well continue to make progress toward the 2015 goal in 2014.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with ISI.', 'Glenn Schorr - ISI ', 'A two-parter, quickly, on reserves. One, I just want to make sure the reserve build that you spoke about, especially on the international side, is a function of growth and not some concerns on credit?', 'John Gerspach', 'The two particular areas of credit concerns that we had in the quarter were the home builder loans that I mentioned and the impact of those two hurricanes that hit Mexico during the month of September. So when you think about the $170 million reserve build that I mentioned for Latin America, three quarters, maybe a little bit more of that build, were really associated with those two items. And the rest is portfolio growth.', 'Glenn Schorr - ISI ', 'And then you also said inside holdings, I think, this quarter, you had the 725. You broke down the portion related to losses, and the portion related to just overage, and led us to not more than just losses in the fourth quarter. Just curious, you follow that up with 40 months of coverage. Whats holding back a little bit more? Because the trends on credit seem great.', 'John Gerspach ', 'Yeah, the trends on credit are great, and like anything else, wed like to see where the environment is going into the fourth quarter. There still is a bit of an unsettled environment out there as you may know, and you may see yourself.', 'But in general, when you look at 40 months of coverage - and Im not saying were always going to stay at 40 months of coverage - it wont be unusual, or shouldnt be unusual, for us to have a fairly high months coverage ratio on NCLs when you think about the fact that TDR - troubled debt restructurings - represent just under 20% or so of our first mortgage portfolio on holdings.', 'And as you think about it, the LLR that you need to hold for a TDR is, for all intents and purposes, a discounted value of a life of loan reserve. So, as such, I just think you should expect that our LLR is going to continue to represent fairly significant months of NCL coverage for some time.', 'Glenn Schorr - ISI ', 'The mortgage revenue runoff will happen quickly, as weve seen, and typically theres an expense lag of a quarter or two. Is there anything material you can point to that over the next couple of quarters, as you adjust on that lag, that even in a no-change world, youll get some efficiencies just from running through the normal process?', 'Mike Corbat ', 'Youre referring in this instance to the mortgage business in corp, not the holdings run?', 'Glenn Schorr - ISI ', 'Correct.', 'Mike Corbat ', 'So what weve spoke to is weve clearly, as a company, clearly as an industry, seen the slowdown coming out of the changes [stance] in May for the Fed. And we started very quickly in anticipating that to take actions in the second quarter. Weve taken more actions in the third quarter. Youve probably read in the press some of those actions weve taken. Unfortunately, theres a lag to that, because in the area of fulfillment, weve got commitments that we need to process and get through the pipes. But were focused on it, and clearly making sure that our mortgage business fits what we see as the future capacity, future necessity and demand of that sector.', 'Glenn Schorr - ISI ', 'Last one is, just in [FIC], I understand the choppiness, and you referred to it a couple of times, on the macro stuff, that delayed the quarter or impacted the quarter. Just curious if it was particularly acute within emerging market FX or within credit, just so we can adjust for ourselves. Because were well below something like a 12-quarter average number.', 'John Gerspach ', 'And when you think about the impact on the [FIC] revenues, it certainly had the largest product that was impacted quarter on quarter and year over year, was certainly our rates and currencies business. And you wouldnt be wrong in thinking about the fact that there was a fair degree of that impact that was concentrated in the emerging markets.', 'And thats really due to the fact that in the third quarter, even towards the end of June, we saw a high amount of volatility in certain emerging markets. And in some cases we saw spreads widening between 50 and 250 basis points. So as a result, we pared back our risk in many of those markets, while still providing liquidity to our customers during this period of turmoil.', 'So Id say that the combination of the high volatility and our intentionally running a lower risk in many of the markets made for a more difficult environment for us to capture trading opportunities.', 'Operator', 'And your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.', 'Gerard Cassidy - RBC ', 'On the $300 million of Mexican loans that you identified, what types of loans to builders? Are they more land loans, or are they working capital loans? What type of loans are they?', 'John Gerspach ', 'Theyre development loans. Theyre, you know, building loans as far as people are building. They have the land, and theyre looking for construction type of loans.', 'Gerard Cassidy - RBC ', 'And in terms of your transaction business, you talked about the challenges that youre having with the spreads, and its been like this for some time, because of the low rate environment. Can you share with us what kind of interest rate environment would be ideal for that business to start seeing wider spreads?', 'John Gerspach ', 'Rising rates, but particularly rising rates in the current to five-year area. So far, to the extent weve had any sort of rising rate environment, its been more out towards the 10-year and higher. And we really need the shorter tenures to begin to rise to really benefit that business.', 'Gerard Cassidy - RBC ', 'Would you benefit more for the rates here in the U.S. or in the E.U., or is it 50-50? Which rates may work better, once they start rising?', 'John Gerspach ', 'U.S. rates would definitely have a faster and certainly more impactful hit on us.', 'Gerard Cassidy - RBC ', 'You, like your peers, I presume, have made comments to the Federal Reserve about the SLR that theyve proposed. Whats you folks view on the possibility of them easing up, or giving you guys some relief in the way theyre defining the assets that youre going to use, and the denominator for that equation, such as cash at central banks? Do you think they might pull that out of the equation? Or are they really focused on just keeping it the way it is?', 'John Gerspach ', 'Thats a little difficult to answer. The comment period only ended a brief time ago, and so theres a lot to see how the Fed and others take a look at the various comment letters that were submitted. And Id say that, as I normally do, we continue to have constructive dialogues with our regulators, and so well have to see how they react.', 'Gerard Cassidy - RBC ', 'Coming back to Citi Holdings and talking about the loan loss reserve releasing, if we were to see housing prices appreciate in 2014 in the mid to high single-digits, down from where weve seen low double-digits, would that give you more confidence to release more reserves?', 'John Gerspach ', 'I dont want you to think that the amount of loan loss reserves that we think we need to hold is solely linked to home price movements. Its that, its also a bit of the overall economy. So theres a lot. Theres whats going on with delinquencies. And, as I mentioned to one of the prior callers, it also has to do with the amount of TDRs that we have in the portfolio, where youre really then dealing with, like I said, almost a discounted life of loan reserve. And thats not necessarily going to get influenced tremendously by movements in HPI.', 'Gerard Cassidy - RBC ', 'And then finally, John, on slide 31 you guys give us good detail on the consumer credit delinquency trends, and obviously theyre going in the proper direction for the total portfolio. Are there any of those subsectors, whether its Mexico or Korea, that concern you the most, or what we should kind of keep an eye on? Because the total numbers are good, but some of the subsectors are going the opposite direction.', 'John Gerspach ', 'Id say that the ones that you would think about are the ones that were focused on as well, which is, as I mentioned, Mexico. Not that weve got a tremendous worry in Mexico, but we called out a couple of things with the home builders. And well have to assess the impact of the recent storms. Mexico is also going through a period where theyre still absorbing the change in administration and a lot of the reform work that is going on with the new administration, so we think that long term thats beneficial, but its certainly had a slowdown in growth in the near term in Mexico. But Mexico, Korea, those are certainly the countries where weve got the two largest portfolios, and so those are certainly two good ones to watch.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.', 'Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research ', 'Just a quick question. Youre down to 6% of assets out of Citi Holdings, but the RWAs are still at 20%. Is that all a function of the mortgage side? Or are there some idiosyncratic or large RWA assets in, say, SAP that we could see some more progress on the RWAs on the Basel III side?', 'John Gerspach ', 'Its a combination of both things. There are, as you put it, some idiosyncratic, but theyre somewhat small as well. The largest impact were going to have on driving down RWA, over time, will still be resident with the mortgages. But, you know, there are a few things that are in SAP, such as weve got a lot of the hold to maturity securities, and thats going to certainly impact us. And the other one that sort of exists below the surface is op risk. Dont forget, op risk also, when you get into a Basel III environment, theres a decent chunk of your RWA that is constituted by op risk. And that is a much longer term part of your capital base to try to get rid of. So its largely mortgages. Theres a couple of things in SAP that could give us a pop, but op risk is also going to take some time to work our way out of.', 'Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research ', 'Should we expect any pop from the sale of some of the hedge fund and private equity assets that looks like will close in the fourth quarter?', 'John Gerspach ', 'Not really.', 'Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research ', 'And maybe another question on the SLR. It seems like theres been more effort to use compression trades and its unclear on the benefits of OTC clearing, but I would assume that would also be positive on notional value. Have you got any sense whether you think thats a big item, a small item? And obviously you cant give any numbers, but do you think that could have some positive impact on SLR going forward?', 'John Gerspach ', 'I clearly think it could have a positive impact on the SLR going forward. I think the magnitude of the impact is something that well have to see over time, just to see just how much of that we can actually accomplish.', 'Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research ', 'And last question, just on CCAR. You guys, obviously with one of the strongest Basel III ratios, the new stress test will partially use Basel III, and your SLR is above 5% already, do you guys feel a lot better, still cautious? How do we think about your approach to CCAR at the end of this year?', 'Mike Corbat ', 'Well, I think versus a year ago, Id say we certainly feel better, and we feel better by a few things. We laid out that we wanted to get the right result in terms of last years submission. I think we got that, and I think, importantly, it just wasnt the quantitative piece, it was the qualitative piece.', 'And since then, I think weve shown the ability to generate capital in a meaningful way when we kind of get the right things working. The combination of corporate earnings, reducing the drag in holdings, the utilization, the DTA, and I think weve started to build a track record of that.', 'But I think weve got more work to do. We continue to be in a challenging operating environment, and as John and I have described, I dont think thats going to change. And at this point, we really dont know the scenarios and what theyre going to be, so well take those on board, well see how the fourth quarter shapes up, and then well start to make some decisions in terms of what our submission might look like.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research.', 'Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research ', 'First question is on one of the items that you think broadly you can control, which is your expense structure. Obviously securities and banking saw a pretty significant decline in revenue and we know that expenses can be sticky, but it seemed as if they were very sticky when you look at the efficiency ratio there, even ex the DVA issues. And I was wondering is there some high level of litigation reserve build maybe thats encompassed within the expenses there this quarter?', 'John Gerspach ', 'Theres a minor amount of litigation expenses, but I dont think its anything that would be driving the expense [due] in securities and banking. Otherwise we would have called it out for you.', 'Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research ', 'I think you might have mentioned in a [unintelligible] or earlier today that you saw private label securities as still an open issue, and I wasnt sure what you exactly meant to say with that. But maybe you can give us a sense for whether we should be expecting more litigation reserve build as a result of that?', 'John Gerspach ', 'I think the question was more in terms of what issues remain open from a litigation point of view relating to mortgages. And it was more on dealing with holdings and the litigation expenses that we had in holdings, and the fact that with the agreements now that we had reached with Fannie and Freddie, we had pretty much put the repurchase risk with those two - the GSEs - behind us. And my comment was that the largest remaining area of mortgage litigation that I think the industry still faced had to do with private label securitizations.', 'Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research ', 'And if you were building reserves for the private label litigations that did affect you for underwriting and originations that you had done prior to 2009, would that reserve build be in holdings?', 'John Gerspach ', 'Yes, it would.', 'Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research ', 'And the final question, since were talking about holdings expense levels, is as you called out, ex all that stuff, your expense levels in holdings were down about 16% year over year, which is obviously the trend that we all want to see. But I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more guidance over the next one to two years how should we see the expense thats in place for managing all those Citi Holdings assets come down as the assets do.', 'Mike Corbat ', 'Its tough to predict what asset sales will look like. Clearly weve been in a transitioning rate environment, and John had talked about our desire to sell reperforming mortgages and also not only shed the asset but take the expense out. So I think in this environment its tough to know and have a crystal ball looking forward in terms of what sales will look like, and therefore I think its difficult to judge what expense reductions will look like. But as weve been, were going to continue to be focused on trying to manage those expenses down. And again, as we look at asset sales, its not just about the asset sale, the capital release, the risk reduction, its also about the expense reduction. We look at those things in aggregate, and were going to continue to do that and take advantage of those things that are out there. But really tough to predict.', 'Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research ', 'And then maybe just a follow up on that. Maybe you can give us an update on how youre managing One Main?', 'Mike Corbat ', 'One Main is a business that we put through a pretty sizable restructuring. Probably today one of a few, if not only, of scale branch base subprime consumer lending businesses. Not a business, as weve said, that fits long term with us. But again, I think things that have gone on from a regulatory and credit dynamic, theres a real part of society that needs to be served. We think One Main is very well-positioned to do that. And at the point in time where somebody comes along and is willing to pay us a price that we think the business is worth, then well be happy to consider that. But until that, were going to continue to run the business and have it best positioned for that day.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer & Company.', 'Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Company ', 'Just a follow up on the difference between RWAs and assets in holdings. You mentioned that a big portion of the difference is operating risk. And most of holdings looks like a mortgage company now, and Im wondering to what extent is there still an operating mortgage company there? I thought of it mainly as just basically holdings of loans and assets as opposed to an operating company.', 'John Gerspach ', 'Well, you do have to service those assets.', 'Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Company ', 'So its purely a servicing, its not an origination', 'John Gerspach ', 'Correct. And you may think about the fact that certainly in the last couple of years a lot of the expense that has been incurred by people in the industry, including elevated NCL rates, including some of the additional expense dollars that people have had to put in it, have been associated with what has been determined to be operating deficiencies for these mortgages. So there is still a certain amount of op risk that we need to account for in our Basel III risk weighted asset determination.', 'Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Company ', 'But should we expect over time that the RWAs will track down roughly in line with the asset decline? Because we didnt see that this quarter.', 'John Gerspach ', 'Well, lets see. On holdings, the GAAP assets came down $9 billion and the risk-weighted assets and holdings came down about 13. So its more or less in line. Again, it has to do with mix and everything else. I dont think youre going to be able to just look always and say its exactly in a ratio of X to X. Plus, as I mentioned, that op risk does not come down ratably based upon the sale of assets. To the extent Im servicing a loan, I still have op risk.', 'Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Company ', 'And then another question just on the Best Buy acquisition. Should we expect that to have roughly the same profitability of your other partner cards? Or theoretically should it be disproportionately better impact? And I would assume theres some that youd get efficiencies on the expense side in managing that in your existing business.', 'John Gerspach ', 'I would say that over time you should expect it to contribute to increased profitability in retail services, but in the near term its likely to actually be a drag on profitability growth, only because of the mechanics that are involved in calculating now the loan loss reserves that we need to put on Best Buy.', 'You know, under purchase accounting the acquired portfolios now we bring them on our books at fair market value, which means they come on without any loan loss reserve. Therefore, as you build each new loan, as each new incremental loan comes on your books, you need to start putting up loan loss reserves for the estimated inherent losses in those loans. And theres no benefit from old loans rolling off your books, so you dont see any reduction in LLR because youve got old loans rolling off.', 'So the first 12 months, maybe the first 15 months, of the acquisition, youre going to see an accelerated build of LLR, just resulting from the mechanics, before everything smooths itself out.', 'Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer ', 'And the tax books work the same way?', 'John Gerspach ', 'Well, the tax books, the tax return, wont reflect. But I think what youre interested in is the DTA aspect.', 'Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer ', 'Correct. Do acquisitions help the DTA?', 'John Gerspach ', 'They do over the longer term, but I take tax benefit for the LLR just as I do with any other business. So, again, the first year or so, it will be less beneficial than you might otherwise think.', 'Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer ', 'And then finally, just to ask Guys question a different way, in securities and banking we saw revenues go from $6.4 billion to $5.1 billion, so down $1.3 billion, but expenses only came down $100 million. And should one just not look at it on a linked-quarter basis? I mean, it just didnt seem like they came down in line with revenues.', 'John Gerspach ', 'I actually agree with your comment. I think that quarter on quarter expense variations in that business can be a bit misleading. I personally believe that to really get a true picture of how a firm is managing its expense base, you need to look at its performance over a full year. And I think if you do the analysis, and if you look at the expenses in that business', 'Just take out our fourth quarter 12 repositioning reserve, and look at those expenses on a trailing 12 month basis, for a run of quarters, what youre going to see is that expenses, both in the ICG and securities and banking have been steadily declining since the first quarter of last year. So on a trailing 12 months basis, the efficiency ratios in both ICG and securities and banking have also been steadily improving during that same timeframe.', 'And I think that if you take a look at that and you compare our efficiency ratios on a trailing 12 month basis over that timeframe with our peer institutions, using the ICG ratios for the universal banking peers and the security and banking ratios for our more pure play investment banking peers, I think youre going to find that we hold up pretty well and almost every quarter our trailing 12 month expense efficiency is better than each of our peers.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.', 'Mike Mayo - CLSA ', 'I wanted to follow up on that last question, and its been asked several times. So if we were to accept that your trailing 12 month expense efficiency looks good, but still I think the issue is the quarter on quarter decline. You said it could be misleading in the bigger picture of things. But at the same time, what weve heard is macro still has headwinds, markets are still unsettled, its a challenging operating environment, and you only have $100 million of savings left. So I think the concern is, is this potentially an inflection point for whats been a decent trailing 12 month record, but now were going into an area thats maybe not going to get us positive operating leverage?', 'Mike Corbat ', 'When we laid out our public targets in spring, we laid out an efficiency ratio which we then went on and spoke to what portion of thats consumer versus whats ICG. And we spoke to mid to high 50s for ICG. And so clearly those businesses have taken that on. And again, weve talked about tepid top line growth in terms of low single digits, and the businesses have to onboard that, and they have. And theyve got to work to achieve that.', 'So I dont think theres a mystery, or theres any surprise to what needs to be done. And again, I think those metrics were designed without looking at overreaching revenue targets. And so, again, I think theyre in line, and well continue to adjust.', 'And I think youve seen, away from the significant repositioning charge in the fourth quarter, us at a run rate somewhere plus or minus $100 million or $125 million a quarter. Again, going at it in that BAU we described. And obviously some of thats coming out of ICG, and wed expect them to keep continue doing that in their business.', 'Mike Mayo - CLSA ', 'So how should I think about this? For the firm as a whole, revenues from the second to the third', 'quarter were down $1.6 billion, and expenses were down roughly $300 million. So thats a $1.3 billion gap linked quarter. To get the other $100 million of savings, its still a $1.2 billion gap. So either revenues need to improve or stabilize in certain areas, or expenses have to go down a lot. Where is the extra leverage?', 'John Gerspach ', 'Mike, I still think youre focused on the quarter to quarter. And again, the targets that we set out were targets for a full year. And I think that when you take a look at performance, you want to judge the performance over a full year. Now, granted, if you want to take a look out of full year, thats okay. So judge us by how we perform then, over that full year, when we get there.', 'But the targets specifically that we set out for securities and banking back in March is we said that in 2015 we would be able to run securities and banking with an efficiency ratio of between 55% and 60%. And people at that point in time thought that that was a pretty good target to aim for. Well, in fact, if you take a look at our securities and banking business, on a trailing 12 month basis, were operating that business at a 57% efficiency ratio.', 'Mike Mayo - CLSA ', 'Yeah, I guess the test will be a year from now, as we look back. Are you as confident as you were before that youll have positive operating leverage looking ahead?', 'John Gerspach ', 'Were still committed to getting to the efficiency ratios that we laid out for 2015, as well as the ROA targets that we laid out for 2015.', 'Mike Mayo - CLSA ', 'If I can shift gears, on Citi Holdings, what were the losses on the asset sales of $4 billion?', 'John Gerspach ', 'I dont have that number in my head. Im sorry.', 'Mike Mayo - CLSA ', 'But it was a loss?', 'John Gerspach ', 'I dont even know. It could have been a slight net gain. I actually think it was a slight positive this quarter. Thats one of the reasons why I called out the fact that the 0.5 in that upper left quadrant of that one chart is something that I think will likely come down, just because there were some episodic gains in that 0.5.', 'Mike Mayo - CLSA ', 'So how should we think about pretax earnings and holdings? The last four quarters, its gone from negative $1.7 billion, negative $1.3 billion, negative $900 million, negative $500 million. So thats a nice trend, but you said dont read too much into home price appreciation. So if we were trying to model that, what would you point us to?', 'John Gerspach ', 'Well, our target is still to drive holdings to breakeven, to close to breakeven, by 2015. And I think that were still on a path to do that, but I dont want you to think that that path is going to be linear. Theres likely to be some ups and downs in that. But in general, the trend is moving towards breakeven by 2015.', 'Mike Mayo - CLSA ', 'Since youre getting so close to that target now, why wouldnt you revise that projection from 2015 to, say, late 2014 even?', 'John Gerspach ', 'Well, the target that we put out was in March, so were seven months into achieving a target that we said we would do over, you do the math. I guess its somewhere around 33 months. So we still have 26 months to go to the end of 2015.', 'Mike Mayo - CLSA ', 'And then as it relates to emerging markets, you said revenues in Korea should stabilize early next year.

We did delay. We didnt have much to talk about with branded cards, quite frankly, in the third quarter. Youre likely to see some additional advertising and marketing as we move into the fourth quarter. And hopefully what I think youll see over the course of the fourth quarter, and then into 2014, is some new product offerings and some revitalized product offerings that we should have in branded cards.

Is there kind of a run rate that you would expect kind of irrespective of all those volatile items of legal, and then something on top of that that we should expect?

But I didnt, nor do I want to, comment specifically on operating leverage in Korea itself, or in any other specific country.', 'Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities ', 'Just moving on to the slide on corporate loan details within Brazil, India, and China, which was very interesting, I guess Im just curious, given how low the loss rates are in those countries - and I appreciate a lot of that is due to the loan mix - are the loan mixes in some of your smaller exposures within EM markets similar in terms of the CTS and TF composition? Or are they more varied across the smaller exposures you have in EM?', 'John Gerspach ', 'Well, the loan composition in each country will be slightly different. You can see how the loan composition inside China, India, and Brazil are somewhat different. But the trend is still going to be much more towards loans for either local market champions - in other words those really high quality emerging market headquartered companies - or to subsidiaries of companies that are headquartered in the development markets, and then with a fairly decent dose, where we have it, of trade-related. So the mix will vary, but its going to look something like this if you think about the way these three countries are portrayed.', 'Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities ', 'And then just one final question on the domestic mortgage portfolio.

On the four-panel slide that you referred to, the message is clear that adjusted PPNR may be lower than weve seen over the past few quarters, but still positive. And when you said youre utilizing reserves for future chargeoffs, that implies to me your provision. I guess is it fair to conclude that when you get to breakeven, the holdings have to do with your legal and related costs at this point?', 'John Gerspach ', 'I would say that, again, there will be some variability, as you just laid out, in that upper quadrant. And Im not going to say that it could never go negative. I dont want you to think that thats always going to be positive. Theres a chance it could go slightly negative depending upon how low the asset volumes get in the business, etc. But youre absolutely right, the single largest driver of when we are able to get to holdings to be consistently breakeven really has to do with the legal and related costs.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Guggenheim Securities.', 'Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities', 'I wanted to kind of go back to the CCAR question and just focus on dividends. As youre going through the reinstitution of your dividend, how do you think about that when you kind of look at the volatility of earnings that have been anywhere from a quarterly run rate of close to $1 this quarter or at the top end was close to $1.30, given the Fed gives you about a 30% kind of leeway. How do you think about that when you go to establish this dividend level going into next year?', 'John Gerspach ', 'I think when you look at it, the corporate finance math pretty clearly points you towards a preference of buyback versus dividend as your stock trades below book. And so I think that will be the first bias. But at that point, we also understand that we, to some degree, need to be mindful, and over time continue to address the dividend issue. So well look at those tradeoffs as we approach, but again, I think as has been very clearly signaled by the Fed, the bar around dividend is higher than buyback, just based on the nature of what a dividend is. And so well have to take that into account.', 'Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities ', 'And then just briefly touching on the expense versus revenue, the way youre looking at that trailing 12 months, is that just because the composition is more fixed with salary and bonus versus variable expenses, so that over time you kind of work your way through the ups and downs of revenue and create traction and efficiencies, but youre not going to be able to move as quickly to the quarterly fluctuations?', 'John Gerspach ', 'Id say that I still think that the best way to measure your efficiency is over time. And therefore, as you look at something over a trailing 12 month basis, you would have captured a full year of performance, and I really think thats the best way to judge how a firm is evidencing expense discipline.', 'Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities ', 'And I wouldnt disagree with that as much as I was trying to just get at is that just a difference in the way that the compensation is kind of set up now and structured, and looking at it over that time really is a better way to do that, because of the way the compensation is structured now?', 'John Gerspach ', 'I think its a matter of how compensation is structured between deferrals of incentive comp. Much more is deferred now and recognized over three or four years, and so a lot of the compensation expense that you have in a year actually relates to performance in other years, as well as the operating performance that you have in the current year. Plus, theres different methodologies that firms employ in how they accrue compensation expense, and when they accrue compensation expense. But when you get to year-end, you have to have the expenses accrued for that years performance, in that year. So thats why I continue to think that at any given point in time, you really want to measure people on a trailing 12 month basis.', 'Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities', 'And lastly, on page 38, youre showing the loan to value for mortgages in Citi Holdings, and youve seen a marked improvement in those that have loan to values over 100%, to the point now that your reserves cover basically 100% of those balances when you start looking at those that have greater than 100% and FICOs less than 660. So when youre talking about home prices and the difference it makes, it does make a difference on this particular page, in that youre seeing migration into more stable and better-performing buckets. That would still be a positive you could see rolling forward, I would think.', 'John Gerspach ', 'And youre absolutely correct.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Derek De Vries of UBS.', 'Derek De Vries - UBS ', 'You just sort of opened the can of worms on deferred comp, and Im wondering if you could just help me understand it a little bit. As we get to the end of the compensation year within securities and banking, can you just give us the amount of, just broadly, in hundreds of millions or billions, or whatever, the amount that would be awarded but not yet expensed? That would help us understand the ability to flex down the cost there. So I was wondering if you could just give us the awarded but not yet expensed at the end of the compensation year.', 'John Gerspach ', 'Im not prepared to do that at this point in time.', 'Derek De Vries - UBS ', 'And then maybe just a slightly more generic question then. Im trying to sort of reconcile the comments you made in the beginning, the challenging and uneven operating environment, with more of an upbeat backdrop on loan growth, particularly in emerging markets. And just as we go forward, should we think about the kind of growth rates that youve been able to deliver recently? Or do you see some things that make you think that could slow down a little?', 'John Gerspach ', 'I would take a look at the overall environment and I do think that it does remain challenging. We have been able to grow loans in a challenging environment, although that loan growth has been a little bit less this year than it had been in years before. And even though you can continue to grow loans, then you have the other issue as far as spread compression. So you can continue to grow loans, but if youre growing loans at lower spreads, that not exactly going to be beneficial towards your revenue. So I think that you need to sort through how you think about both. I think weve evidenced that we can certainly grow the volumes, but I think what you also see is that we have been impacted by a certain amount of spread compression, as have most other people in the industry.', 'Mike Corbat ', 'And as I think about it, theres two things in some ways in competition. I think as you look at growth estimates as we look forward for 2013, weve seen, off of downward revisions in 2013 actually some uplifts in 14. But I think at the same point, when you go back and you look historically and you can look at several points of history, 94-95 certainly easily being one of those, any time in particular out of the U.S. youre transitioning into a higher rate environment, the EM economies dont come through that cleanly. I think in many ways today those economies are much better positioned to come through the shift towards higher rates, and whether thats a rise in foreign exchange reserves, whether thats floating exchange rate mechanisms, external liquidity, and you can go on and on through those. But again, I just think a transitioning U.S. interest rate is certainly going to have an impact on trading volumes, capital flows, new issuance calendars. And so I think weve got to try and strike a balance between those things.', 'Operator', 'Your next question is coming from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.', 'Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan', 'I wont beat up on the securities and banking efficiency ratio question, even though thats up 10 percentage points linked quarter. Lets turn to the other two businesses that are almost two-thirds of your revenues, GTS and global consumer banking. So following a little bit of your trail of thought, John, youre looking at it year to date. GTS efficiency ratios up from, I believe, 52% to 54%, and global consumer bank is up also from 53% to 54%. So even though youre more than halfway through your cost restructuring, your efficiency ratios are going the other direction. Can you talk to that a little bit, especially given your confidence about GTS for the second half?', 'John Gerspach ', 'I think what youre going to see in transaction services - and I said it before - I think youll start to see improvement beginning in the fourth quarter. And that improvement should begin to then roll forward through next years results as well. And I have no doubt that transaction services will meet the efficiency targets that we set out for them for 2015. Consumer has been bumping around at, as you mentioned, 53-54% probably, if I look at it on a trailing 12 month basis, for the last five quarters maybe. But theres still work to go there. They have not fully completed the rollout of rainbow yet. And obviously were still in the process of readjusting the mortgage business. So theyve got that running through the top line, and we havent quite gotten the expenses out in mortgages yet. And the commitment was that we would get consumer to 47% to 50% by 2015. And so I still think that were on track to do that.', 'Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan', 'Even though so far youve gone the other direction? Youre over half [unintelligible] in 14. Okay, a couple of little ones. Private label, I just want to come back to that. Did you add anything for that in the third quarter?', 'John Gerspach ', 'There was a very small amount, because dont forget we only had the Best Buy', 'Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan', 'No, sorry, private label MBS. My apologies.', 'John Gerspach ', 'Im sorry. When it comes to private label securitizations, Im not going to comment about any specific reserving in the quarter.', 'Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan', 'And then turning to Best Buy, did you take on any delinquencies with that?', 'John Gerspach ', 'Again, when it comes to the Best Buy, we did take on delinquencies. And so the delinquencies do end up in our statistics. Its just that, from a reserving point of view, we dont pick up loan loss reserves.', 'Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan', 'And those are not marked down, the loan portfolios?', 'John Gerspach ', 'The loan portfolios come on our books on a fair market value basis.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Adam Hurwich with Ulysses Management.', 'Adam Hurwich - Ulysses Management', 'Im referring to slide 21, 26, and slide 41. Youve managed to keep your risk-weighted assets pretty flat, actually declining, on a Basel III basis. And at the same time, you seem to be growing your regulatory capital currently at a $15 billion rate and rising. Im just wondering, how do we think about capital adequacy going forward? And given your capital build rate, at some point we need to think a little bit more holistically about what you do with that. Could you give us at least the basis to understand that?', 'John Gerspach ', 'Youve got a lot of questions wrapped up in there. Let me try to parse through a little bit of that, and you come back where Ive failed. From a capital build rate, certainly the capital is building as a result of the earnings, as well as the DTA. So this quarter, the earnings themselves were a lot of $3 billion, the DTA was a benefit of $500 million, then we also had a benefit of OCI, which of course from a Basel III basis ends up in that as well. So, over the course of the quarter, we actually built about $4.5 billion worth of regulatory capital from those three components. What weve said is that our expectation is over time we would target running at a 10% Basel III ratio. Now, we need to think about how we may change that as the supplemental leverage ratio rules begin to finalize, but thats where we are right now. So what have I failed to answer?', 'Adam Hurwich - Ulysses Management ', 'You didnt fail to answer anything. The only reason Im asking this is because there seems to be a lot of focus on GAAP numbers, but theres a large discrepancy between GAAP and regulatory capital measures. And there seems to be a benefit that you will accrue due to that differential. Am I missing anything, or in fact when regulators are comfortable with the bank, will we be able to see a benefit from the discrepancy?', 'John Gerspach ', 'I think youre right. As a matter of fact, one of the things that we talk about is the fact that as we think about the strategies for our Citicorp businesses, we think that those Citicorp businesses operate in a very Basel III friendly way. Were focused on real high-level credit worthy customers in both the consumer businesses as well as in the corporate business, and we think we can run the business, as I say, in a very efficient manner under Basel III. It maybe referenced in one of the slides that we have in the appendix that shows the returns that we get on a Basel III basis. So thats where were headed with the strategy. As far as how the regulators view us and what might be the future, again, we think that were in fairly constructive dialogs with the regulators.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Andrew Marquardt with Evercore.', 'Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners ', 'A couple of ticky-tack questions. Just to follow on that last question, in terms of capital, can you help us understand, is there a material difference in terms of tier one common Basel III under the standardized approach versus the advanced?', 'John Gerspach ', 'Theres a very large difference between the way those two calculations work, and under the terms of Dodd-Frank, what large banks in the U.S. are directed to do is report the lower of the two ratios. So currently we are reporting our ratios under the advanced approach.', 'Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners ', 'Which is the lower of the two?', 'John Gerspach ', 'Yes, by definition. I couldnt report it if it wasnt.', 'Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners ', 'And then separately, you had mentioned, in terms of unfunded commitments, there was a reserve build, partly due to growth in commitments, as well as some risk migration downward. Can you help clarify exactly what was going on there in terms of risk migration?', 'John Gerspach ', 'In our commitments book, we took a look at some of the commitments we had to our clients, especially clients that are in countries where the country itself ends up being risk weighted lower. We therefore re-rate the company, and therefore ended up building a bit more reserves.', 'Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners ', 'Should we expect continued build in unfunded commitment reserves? Or is this kind of a one-time adjustment?', 'John Gerspach ', 'I wouldnt call it a one-time adjustment, but its another one of those episodic adjustments. I dont anticipate that level of migration repeating in the fourth quarter, but I cant tell you that it absolutely wont, either.', 'Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners ', 'And then lastly, just bigger picture, in terms of the margin on a consolidated basis. You had mentioned you expect it may be flattish in the fourth quarter. But then beyond that, is it fair to assume that there will be still kind of this gradual grind down in terms of the margin on a consolidated basis, given the global spread compression that youve referenced?', 'John Gerspach ', 'I think as long as we stay in a low interest rate environment, youre going to have, as you put it, that grind down approach. I would think at some point in time we would begin to see some level of interest rate increase, and then you could get a bit of a benefit. Until then, its going to be really a matter of how the calculus works out between your ability to grow loans and lower your cost of funding, how those two factors offset the impact of the continued spread compression.', 'Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners ', 'And lastly, just to wrap it kind of maybe back to the first question, on this long call, of kind of getting to your longer term ROA goal, what would be your view of a normalized interest margin over the cycle to get into that 90/110 ROA basis?', 'John Gerspach ', 'We didnt really talk about that at that point in time, and I dont really have a longer term NIM goal that I care to share at this point in time.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.', 'Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ', 'Just one quick question on TSS.

       "('2010Q4', defaultdict(<type 'list'>, {'EdwardNajarian': ['Maybe just two quick ones. Would you be willing to disclose some approximation of what your Bassel III based Tier 1 Common ratio is today? And then how would you advise us to think about the pace of shrink of Citi Holdings over the next 12 months?', 'And then, obviously, as we get to the end of this quarter, you get some sense from the regulators, we think, in terms of what your discussions with regulators are, what they come back to you with in terms of your capital planning. Do you expect to give us more detail on capital planning and on your Bassel III base Tier 1 Common ratio when you report first quarter earnings and will be enabled at that time?'], 'JohnGerspach': ['Thank you, Vikram, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 2. On a full year basis, Citigroup reported revenues of nearly $87 billion for 2010. Operating expenses totaled $47.4 billion. Credit costs were $26 billion, down 50% from prior year levels on a comparable basis. And for the full year, we earned $10.6 billion in net income or $0.35 per diluted share. We earned nearly $15 billion in our core Citicorp business, with earnings in Asia and Latin America contributing more than half of the total. Citi Holdings generated a loss of $4.2 billion.', 'If you think in terms of the way it breaks down, about $150 million of the increase was due to foreign exchange, about $400 million more or less was legal and related matters, $100 million was severance and restructuring and about $150 million each of investment and volume driven growth.', \"Well, as you said, Guy, we don't breakout comp for any of our individual businesses. But, obviously, our comp considerations reflect performance for the full year. Throughout the year, we do our best to estimate what we think we're going to be paying out. So we take all of that into consideration.\", \"There was some contribution in S&B of litigation, but I wouldn't say that S&B was the primary driver behind the $400 million that I talked about earlier.\", \"As we said, I think it was last quarter, we believe that the types of claims associated with private label securitizations are going to manifest themselves in the context of litigation. We made that statement last quarter and that kind of holds true. But as we've said last quarter, to date, we have not received a significant number of claims in connection with private label securitizations. Obviously, we continued to monitor all the activities associated with this, but given the relative lack of historical experience, it naturally kind of follows on that it's difficult to estimate future claims here. So as with all such matters, we're continuing to evaluate our litigation reserves and at the end of the quarter, overall, we feel that we are appropriately reserved and that we're going to continue to monitor everything that's going on with private label securitizations. The other thing, Guy, I think you have to put our position of private label securitizations a bit in context. When you think in terms of the issuances that were done in '05 through '08, we had about a 3% market share and as near as we can tell, we probably ranked eighth among issuers during that time period. Some of our peer institutions have market shares that are 5x or 8x higher than that, so while private label securitizations are something that we obviously are continuing to monitor, it, quite frankly, isn't as big an exposure for us as it might be for others.\", \"Yes, I'm going to take a pass on going through month-to-month performance. But the decline was not due to a decline in customer volume levels. Customer activity stayed pretty solid during the quarter. And as we tried to indicate, it really did reflect just weaker trading performance, especially in the Fixed Income business. As far as what products may have driven it, I would say that G10 Rates probably contributed 2/3, maybe, of the decline, due to the weaker trading performance.\", \"I might comment, Guy, but about half of that decline that we had in the quarter, half of the 12 basis points, was due to the building of the reserve for customer refunds in our Consumer Finance business in Japan. So absent that, the decline in NIM would have been closer to six basis points. And I think that pretty much forms my view as to what might happen going into the first quarter. We could be looking at something in the mid-low digits as far as a decline in NIM. And then maybe it'll stabilize beginning in the second quarter.\", \"A conscious effort on our part. One of the things that I think we mentioned last time is, that we are looking at improving the quality of the deposits that we have. So we actually adjusted our pricing to try to capture more of non-interest bearing and less -- we've got such a good demand for non-interest bearing that there's no need to go out and continue to be in the middle of the pack as far as time deposit pricing. So we've pretty much moved our time deposit pricing down in virtually all regions. And there was also, in North America, there was a bit of a one-time shift that we had between NOW, in NOW accounts, that used to be part of interest-bearing and are now classified as far as non-interest bearing. So that contributed in North America to about $9 billion to $10 billion of the growth there. So it's a conscious trend on our part, but the NOW account shift is a significant one-time item in North America.\", \"Well, don't forget, when we've set up Citicorp and Citi Holdings, it wasn't set up on a good bank, bad bank strategy. It was actually set up, Citicorp represented those businesses that fit the strategy that we have going forward and the businesses that we placed in Citi Holdings, including Retail Partner Cards, for those businesses that just didn't fit. So I would never say never, but what we'd have to look at is to see whether or not Retail Partner Cards or some elements of Retail Partner Cards are now really fitting in with the Citicorp strategy, based upon the re-underwriting of the book and the way that businesses or portfolios in that business are now being managed.\", 'Yes, and we will tend to pace our investment spending based upon the way we see the other investments playing out. So the short answer is, yes, we do have flexibility in our expense base.', \"I'm not so sure of the underlying thesis in your question, which is why I'm having a difficult time answering it, Matt. I'm not sure that our trading is anymore volatile than anybody else's, especially when you eliminate the impact of CVA from it. I think CVA, certainly throughout 2009 and now in the fourth quarter of 2010, maybe has been a bigger contributor to us than to others. Otherwise, I'm not quite sure that we really fall outside the band necessarily.\", \"Well, one quarter doesn't make a trend. And so I think you need to take a look at the overall trading performance over several quarters, if not several years.\", \"Well, tax rates, on a normal basis, if you look at us over time, our expectation is, that our tax rate should be in the upper 20s. 27%, 28% would be the right range. But as long as we are in periods where more of our income is going to be driven by our performance in lower tax rate jurisdictions. In other words, as we're continuing to rebuild the North America business, particularly the earnings stream in North America consumer, our tax rate will be below the numbers that I just quoted.\", \"I would look at it more as a steady state type of thing. I'm not going to say that our expenses are going to be back-end loaded or front-end loaded. I think we'll have a little, obviously, we will look to pace investments based upon where we are. So, if anything, the expenses might tend to be a little back-end loaded, but I don't think it's going to be a huge trend.\", \"Well, as we've always said, when we take a look at reserves, we try to make sure that the reserves reflect the losses that are embedded in those individual portfolios. So as we get more confidence that the losses embedded in that portfolio are truly declining, you're likely to see continued reserve releases. I can't tell you that you're suddenly going to see a $1 billion reserve release. We don't tend to build them in big increments like that, and we don't tend to release them in big increments like that.\", \"Yes, I'm not going to predict operating leverage, especially in a business like Securities and Banking. One thing I'd say is, 2009, I do think we had somewhat outsized performance coming out of the first quarter in 2009. So that clearly is a difficult point of comparison. And, as we've said, our view is that we had weaker trading results in the fourth quarter. We'll see how we performed and our expectation is that we'll pick up that performance during 2011. As far as investments, we've also been, I think, pretty clear that we had made significant investments in building out our Corporate Banking franchise. And earlier in the year, we were still building out equities. We think a lot of equities is now done. The Corporate Banking franchise is still an area where we've got, I think, some work to do, but I think most of the investment work in Securities and Banking now is behind us.\", \"When you take a look at -- you're talking about the investment Securities, the AFS, right?\", \"We are in the midst of repositioning that book, given the rate environment. I'm not going to make a public statement as to where we think rates are going, but it's just that obviously we did take some of the Securities off the table and that's one of the reasons why our cash balances are higher right now. And so you'll see the results of that repositioning as we get further into the first quarter.\", \"Yes, we've always said that proprietary trading or principal positions is a relatively small part of our overall business. We've said publicly that proprietary trading represents less than 2% of our firm revenues. And there is a small prop business that's in equities. During the third quarter, it generated revenues of about $150 million and virtually generated no revenues in the fourth quarter. So that's $150 million out of the $250 million overall decline in our Equity Markets revenues x CVA, quarter-on-quarter.\", 'You take a look at the other comprehensive income, the AOCI, as you say. Two big drivers there. One would be losses on the AFS Securities. That was about $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion of a negative. And then we had a positive pick up on the currency translation adjustment that was worth about $400 million going the other way.', 'The single largest driver would be net income in our North America operations. When you take a look at the breakdown of the DTA, we ended the quarter with DTA of about $52 billion. $5 billion of that is state and local, $5 billion of that is international, so $42 billion is really U.S. federal tax. And the single largest driver there is generating more profits in North America.', \"I'm sorry, do I have any what?\", \"Well, what we've said is that, at least from the impacts of Dodd-Frank that are measurable right now, the change in FDIC assessment is the single largest impact on us. We don't have much of an impact on debit card interchange or overdraft fees. Those are really small impacts on us. But the way that the FDIC has proposed changing its formula will impact all the large banks dramatically -- have a greater dramatic impact on the large banks than it will on the small banks. So our assessment right now is based upon the rules. We're looking at almost a doubling of the FDIC assessment.\", \"Of course, it depends upon exactly when in '11 it goes into effect. So depending upon if it's a second quarter item than it would be three quarters. You can do the math.\", 'We ended with about $52 billion of DTA and $35 billion of that was disallowed in coming up with our Tier 1 Common ratio.', \"I wouldn't say that the European peripheral countries were a significant contributor to any of our trading results. So you can sort of take that one off the table. Again, when you take a look at the trading performance, first quarter '09, I think we all had the same thing. A very, very strong quarter in the first quarter of '09. And that one kind of -- that's going to be something that's going to be very difficult to replicate. And then each quarter sort of tends to tell its own story. As I mentioned, this quarter, our weaker trading was actually concentrated in the Rates and Currency business, particularly the G10 Rates business in fixed income. But there's no indication that there's anything systemic in those numbers.\", \"It's primarily associated with our market making activities as we were trying to facilitate client needs. And if clients were reacting to rising rates, then we were certainly on the other side of that.\", \"Well, again, the $255 million you are talking about is the adjustment that we made to build additional reserves for potential client refunds in our CFJ business. That's a reserve that we have adjusted periodically for four, five years now at this point in time. So again, as we see changes in the market this particular quarter, the build is really associated with what we thought might be an uptick in refund requests related to the talk of Fuji bankruptcy that occurred. So it was really in response to a specific event.\", \"I've just got to correct you just a little bit, Chris. Going into 2010, our guidance was full year expenses of $48 billion to $50 billion. By the second half of the year, we said we thought individual quarters for the second half of 2010 would be $11.5 billion to $12 billion. So we really weren't at an $11.5 billion guidance. And so as we've look ahead to next year, again, we're just trying to be consistent with where we were, quite frankly at the beginning of last year, which is as we look at the overall year, it's $48 billion to $50 billion of total expense. We ended this year with $47.4 billion. So it's not all that much different.\", \"That's correct.\", \"The first one, no, as I said, we're targeting to be at that 8% to 9% range in 2012. As far as the second, look, if you take a look at the assets that are left in Citi Holdings, and we laid them out for you in the deck, we're not likely to maintain the same pace that we had in 2010. Specifically, again, Brokerage and Asset Management which has got roughly $26 billion, $27 billion of assets, that's virtually all tied up in the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney joint venture. And so that's an event as opposed to something that we're going to just wind our way down over the next several quarters. Special Asset Pool is about $80 billion of assets now. We've taken that down dramatically. But now, roughly a third of the remaining Special Asset Pool assets are hold to maturity assets. And so the pace of the reduction in the Special Asset Pool is also going to slow because we just don't have as much inventory, quite frankly, push out. And then you get to the last component and the Local Consumer Lending and more than half of the remaining assets are tied up in U.S. mortgages. And I don't see a big one-time sale of U.S. mortgages. We will continue to sell down assets at a pace, but it's not likely that we're going to find a $20 billion to $30 billion sale on our doorstep at any sort of rational terms in the near-term. So the pace is going to slow from where we've been in 2010 .\", \"Ed, that's kind of unlikely. I mean, unless we significantly change our position as to our view towards 2012 being the year that we'd be looking to return capital, it's not likely that we'd be changing anything else.\", \"Yes, the $3 billion to $4 billion still holds. We actually have been, or have begun, that investment spending, and I think we mentioned the fact that as early as the first quarter of this year of 2010, we had some elements of it in place. Although it certainly picked up pace as we got later into the year. When you look at the fourth quarter, Mike, I mentioned $150 million being the linked quarter-on-quarter impact of investment spending, it's safe to say that something on the order of $300 million to $400 million of our expense base in the fourth quarter represented investment spending.\", 'Well, $3 billion to $4 billion would be the total amount of spending.', \"That's about it.\", \"Well, if you're at a run rate of $1.2 billion for a quarter, for a year, I should say, that would mean that over something like three years then, you would be within that $3 billion to $4 billion range, right?\", 'Exactly.', \"Mike, as you probably well know, we can't comment on any conversations that we have with our regulators.\", 'Well, the biggest impact for us was the adoption of 166, 167 in the first quarter. That added $4.3 billion, $4.4 billion to the DTA asset.', \"Don't forget then, also, besides earnings, you've got the impact of the AFS portfolio, we had losses on the AFS portfolio this quarter. I mentioned that in response to another question. When you think about driving down the DTA, the key component for us is actually to reduce the amount of the DTA that's represented by net operating loss carry forwards. And we've actually taken that down during the year. We started the year with, I think just a little bit north of $5 billion of NOL carry forward. And we'll end the year with about $2.3 billion, maybe $2.2 billion of NOL carry forward. And so once we work our way through that and actually in the Q, I believe the third quarter Q, we actually gave you disclosure that our expectation is that we will be through the NOL carry forward during 2011. And once we work our way through that, then it'll become easier to deal with the foreign tax credit carry forwards, which are the largest piece of our DTA.\", \"I didn't catch the last question. Are we appropriately matched? The impact on revenues and expenses has got less to do with matching assets and liabilities. I mean, the assets and liabilities. . .\", \"And I think in some of the commentary that we gave you, on the international, Regional Consumer Banking franchises, we've mentioned that FX changes drove some of the revenue increase. The revenue was up about 4% and FX probably drove more than half of that. But when you take a look at all of our businesses, we operate in many different currencies around the world. And so FX, overall, has really got a very small impact on our bottom line. And it tends to work its way out as far as revenues expense and NCLs. But when you get into individual lines, FX can be a driver of variance, just in those individual lines.\", \"Yes, and Carole, as a matter of fact, what we've done in the past, we indicated at the end of June that the risk-weighted assets in Citi Holdings represented about 40% of our risk-weighted assets, at that point in time. We then, in September, told you that Citi Holdings risk-weighted assets were down to 37% of our total risk-weighted assets. And by the end of the year, our current estimate is, that the Citi Holdings risk-weighted assets will be about 34% of our total risk-weighted assets. So think in terms of Citi Holdings representing 19% of our GAAP assets and roughly estimated 34% of our risk-weighted assets.\", \"Well, you're right, we do have a lot of cash on the balance sheet and in response to one of the earlier questions, we touched on the fact that there's actually been a decline in our available-for-sale securities during the quarter as we've begun to reposition that portfolio, given the current rate environment. So a little bit of the incremental cash that we have on the books right now is really being driven just because we're in the midst of repositioning that AFS portfolio debt.\", \"As we entered 2010, we comment on the fact that we were deliberately liquid at that point in time and we felt that it was prudent to remain liquid throughout 2010. That gives us a certain amount of flexibility for two things. One, clearly, as our debt now begins to mature and we do have debt sizable amounts of our long-term debt maturing during 2011, we'll have less of a need to roll over that debt. So one of the things that you'll see is our long-term debt begin to go down. That will consume some of that cash. The second is, we are open for business and we're looking to build the loan book in both our Consumer and our Corporate businesses. And so our expectation is that we'll begin to put some of that liquidity to work in 2011.\", \"Yes, our deposit to loan ratio, I'd like to say I tend to think that the other way right now is about 139% or 140%. That's higher than we would expect to be in a long-term basis.\", \"No, there's been no change in our appetite.\", \"I think you asked about deposits. We, right now, again, given where we are from a liquidity point of view, we obviously will be there for our customers to accept deposits, but one of the things that we're focused on right now is addressing, I'm going to call it the quality and the pricing of our deposits. So we are deliberately shifting out of pricing to capture time deposits. And I think you've seen some of the beginnings of that in some of the ships in our interest-bearing deposits, both in the U.S. and in our branches outside the U.S. That's reflected on the face of the balance sheet right now. So we'll look to maintain steady deposits, but try to improve the mix.\"], 'JohnAndrews': ['Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you everyone this morning for joining us.

And can you give us more color when we should see that hit? How much a hit this quarter? I know you said $150 million of the linked quarter increase was due to increased investments and volume related matters, so I'm guessing it hasn't really hit yet. And how much of your expense guidance for the year includes some of this additional investment spending?\", 'That we should see that increase by another $2.6 billion over the next three years?', 'So you got a run rate now of $1.2 billion?', 'So you have another $2 billion more for this investment spending, is that fair to say?', 'So this is just a one-time step up and you maintain that higher level?', 'And then separately, it came out last week that you have an MOU with the regulators. How big a deal is this in your mind? Is it simply backwards looking for some of the problems from a couple of years ago or is this still something you need to wrestle with? You highlighted some risk management issues that you still had to resolve.', \"And then a separate question would be, for the DTAs you earned $10 billion last year on GAAP earnings, but the DTA level still went up to $52 billion as you pointed out. In layman's terms, why does the DTA keep going up even while you have positive GAAP earnings? I know you mentioned some of that is geography, but what are some of the other reasons why it still goes up?\", \"But it's still leaking upward here even in the past couple of quarters.\", 'And then last question for Vikram, you lead off the conference call saying macro trends should dominate micro trends the next couple of quarters. I was just curious why you mentioned the next couple quarters in particular?'], 'AndreaJao': ['First on trading equities and on the fixed income and equities trading businesses, have there been changes in your appetite for taking risk or committing capital as you facilitate customer transactions? Then I have a follow-up regarding the balance sheet.', 'How should I think about the balance sheet by the  end of 2011? Just thinking back to the previous question by Dick, excess liquidity will be replaced by higher loans and less borrowings. How about deposits in your securities book?'], 'JohnAndrewas': ['Thank you, everyone, for committing so much time this morning on a rather lengthy call. Obviously, this will be available for replay on the website later this afternoon and if you have follow-up questions, contact to the IR team here at Citi. Thank you.'], 'RichardBove': [\"I'd like to ask you the same question I asked JPMorgan but in the opposite direction. They've got a negative federal funds plus cash position when divided by assets. You now have roughly 12.9% of your balance sheet on the asset side in cash, plus a positive net fed funds position. Why is it so big? I mean, you're only getting about a 79 basis point return on that money, which must be having an impact on your net interest margin. Could you kind of give me your thinking on this?\", \"If we go back in time, that percentage should be somewhere around 3% or 4% and it would be because, generally speaking, Citigroup always had a negative federal funds position, it's almost shocking to see it with a $57 billion of a net positive federal funds position. And cash has never been this high as a percentage of assets. So one might argue that on a ratio basis, you're 3x higher as a percentage of assets than you would normally be. So just selling off some securities last quarter had no real impact on what I'm talking about.\", \"So it's fair to state that if you start to utilize that excess cash to lend, and if your loan to deposit ratio starts to move up, I'm going to say, again, to more normal levels, that this represents tremendous excess earnings capacity at the moment?\"], 'GlennShore': [\"Question on deposit trends. U.S. were up, non-U.S. were down and non-interest bearing deposits were up and interest-bearing were down. And it's just kind of counterintuitive, I didn't know if that's a repricing thing in conscious effort on your part or a client trend. I don't know how to read into that.\", 'With the clear credit improvement and, especially on the card side, just curious if you had any thoughts about the private label card business in general on whether or not you wind up hanging onto that or is that in the potential disposal list?', 'At the high level, as a general comment, I think people are looking at this and say, \"Revenue is a little weaker.\" Albeit it was a trading thing, but revenue is weaker and expense is still in that same range and you were kind enough to give us expense guidance for 2011. People want to hear if revenues come in a little softer, do you have expense flexibility, considering the legal and the investments and the things like that that are going on. I think that\\'s one of the disappointments in today\\'s results.'], 'CaroleBerger': [\"My question is really on foreign exchange. You mentioned in a couple of places how expenses were impacted by exchange rates, but you didn't mention anywhere where revenues were similarly impacted. Are there places where you are not matched, in terms of where your revenues and expenses are coming from?\", \"I meant in terms of, you mentioned a couple of places where expenses were up because of the exchange rates. And my question is, why aren't revenues also up because of. . .\", 'And my second question was, is there any reason -- you said that 19% of your assets remained in holding. Is there any reason to believe that a greater proportion of those assets are risk weighted? In other words, are more than 19% of your risk-weighted assets in holding?'], 'Question-and-AnswerSession': ['Operator'], 'JeffreyHarte': [\"Bigger picture question. I mean, we look at all the data we're getting on kind of the emerging markets in the international franchise and it seems loans are growing, revenues are growing, credit seems okay, but there's a lot of things going on in the world from currencies to what's going on in Europe. Can you give us any sense on what you're seeing kind of on the ground with some of the emerging markets as far as the kind of near-term continuation of growth prospects?\", 'Can you just maybe specifically comment a little bit on Mexico? That seems to be your biggest non-U.S. market now.', \"And then a little more detail. The equity trading in the quarter, I don't know if the press release cited derivatives activity in principal positions. In an environment where equity markets were up so much in most areas, I'm a little surprised to see principal positions be one of the drivers of the decline. Can you give us any more color on that?\"], 'GuyMoszkowski': [\"I was hoping that maybe you could quantify how much of the linked quarter's increase in expenses actually was litigation, which was one of the primary factors you noted?\", \"Within Securities and Banking, did the expense increase in comp, which I know you don't break out, did that pretty much reflect -- well, actually, I should phrase it differently. Did the comp reflect the decline in revenue or was it also up sequentially?\", \"I guess what I'm trying to get at is whether there would've been a significant increase in litigation type expenses within S&B.\", 'And is it fair to assume that a fair amount of that litigation expense would be reserve building related to things like private label Securities? I know that one of your competitors has talked about not really being able to build for that use through the reserve, but that litigation reserves can be built for that type of thing.', 'And then moving to another subject, just to explore a little bit further the revenue side in Securities and Banking during the quarter. We saw a pretty significant falloff in fixed income, and I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more of a sense. First of all, was a lot of that in December, after a more successful first couple of months? Or was it a little bit more spread over the period? And can you give us a sense for whether some of the product related declines that you alluded to, in terms of rates, were because of the shock that happened in long-term interest rates? Or was it just more because of a decline in customer activity levels?', 'The final question I have for you is on the net interest margin, which declined pretty much in line with the guidance that you had given us early in the quarter. And I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more of a sense for what you thought might happen with net interest margin based on things that you can see now.'], 'JamesMitchell': [\"A couple of questions, one on the loan loss reserve in cards. You guys, I think, over the year-to-date have probably released just a little over $300 million in reserves. For some of your peers, I think even though they're slightly larger in the card business, have released multiple billions. You've had two quarters in a row of improvement. When should we start to see a more significant release on the Citi card portfolio?\", \"The reserve ratio is quite high relative to peers obviously, right? And they seem pretty confident releasing, but obviously, that's fine. On the iBank side, maybe getting to the expense question in another way. Year-to-date, I think if you normalize the DVA or CVA, however you want to define it, your revenues are down close to 19% in S&B, but expenses were up, I think, 11%. Obviously, you put a lot of investment into this year. Should we start to see, assuming we have a better rate revenue environment, some operating leverage on the expense base in 2011 and beyond?\", 'One last question on the Securities investment portfolio. It was down, I think, $21 billion on a period-end basis. Is that sort of positioning for the rate environment? What is your stance vis--vis rates at this point?', 'Correct.'], 'VikramPandit': [\"John, thank you, and good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us today. 2010 was a very good year for Citi. We made excellent progress in executing our strategy in every major area and, as a matter of fact, if you had said a year ago that we would have accomplished what we have, I'm not so sure too many people would have believed it. Yet, we were profitable in each quarter, earning $10.6 billion for the year. Revenues increased for the quarter and for the year in two of our three core businesses, which are Transaction Services and Consumer Banking, and Securities and Banking had strong full year results.\", \"Matt, it's also fair to say that we have a smaller Equity business compared to some of the other firms on the street and we're building that out. And we also have a smaller Commodities business, that also is being built out. So a lot more of our revenues are driven by the Fixed Income business.\", \"Betsy, obviously, all of us still have to go through the process with the regulators and I think that's going to be informative for us, all of us. But as importantly, we want to make sure that we are exactly in the right place on Basel III. And including, by the way, as I've said in the past, we think it's always prudent to carry a little bit of a cushion. You take all that into account, we still think 2012 is the right year for us to return capitals.\", \"Well, I think some of that is -- let us start the other way. A lot of that is the decline in Citi Holdings and the risk that goes down through that. And that's a continual process. We're still in the process of selling a couple of businesses there, that should take risk down. We've got assets in SAP that are going to come down, as well. And so when you look at risk weighted assets coming down, that's going to be the biggest contributor. And we've said in the past that some of that would like to reinvest in building out Citicorp, although that depends on how and where the opportunities to help our clients are going to be. So that is part of our thinking in what drives us to say what John Gerspach said earlier, that if 8% to 9% is the kind of range we're on in Basel III, 2012 is the year that we ought to be able to achieve that.\", \"Well, we can't tell you what we say with our regulators and what they say to us. But what I can tell you is what I've said, again, 2012 is the year we think we'll have the ability to return capital, of course, based on our discussion with our regulators.\", \"Well, I think the way to -- let's start with the very big picture. The Card business is very different than when we moved the partner cards into the Citi Holdings, and that is a consideration that we are well aware of. Having said that, the biggest consideration for us is to run the partner cards in a very optimal way and Zales is an indication of that because there's a lot of franchise value in that, and there's a lot of value in that particular business and we're building that out. We've done nothing to change our view, that is still in Citi Holdings and that remains a driving concern. But I'll also tell you that as with everything we've done through Citi Holdings, our primary goal still continues to be we won't do anything with assets that's not in our shareholders interest and we have clearly that in mind. And that is not going to be impacted by which portfolio we have or how it turns over or any of that. It really comes down to the kind of value we think that Card business represent to us and we want to recognize it for you.\", \"Again, what I would say on that is we haven't changed our mind, it's still in Holdings and it is still part of the assets that we want to rationalize. But obviously, as we do that, we will look at every other option before we make a decision.\", \"We're still exactly where we said we were before and, if you look at how Citicorp is growing, the International Consumer business has done well. We also think the GTS business with the book of business we're building, especially as interest rates change, will start showing some of that through as well. So when you put all of that together and, really, the change in the business models in our Securities and Banking business, we think all of that still takes us back to 1.25, 1.5 on assets that we ought to be able to recognize on a longer-term basis. And of course, interest rate environments are also important in terms of where and how we get to that.\", \"I think we've said that, that's a kind of business that should be able to earn 1.25 and 1.5 in much more of a normalized environment. And normalized we were talking about is, of course, credit taking account but as credit changes, that's one of the factors and got to say interest rates are another factor, too.\", \"Let me take a crack and then, John, will add to that as well. I think the first part, I would say, is that for us or anybody else, some of the definitional issues still have to be worked through. A lot of the measurement issues are still going to have to be worked through and we've said in the past and I'll say again, we think 2011 is a year where a lot of those details get worked out. That's an important part to it. And the second part of that is that we do want to manage our business in a prudent way, which is why we said we want to carry a cushion. And putting all of those things into account, we think its prudent to think about returning capital in 2012.\", 'No, there are no systematic issues other than those that are generic for everybody.', \"Well, first of all, the emerging markets, that is a broad group. We know what's happening in certain areas. You see it in South Africa, you see it in China, which is the growth in inflation there. And especially those countries that don't have a flexible currency are seeing more of that and there is growth adjustment there, as a resultl of these changes. But I would say that the underlying dynamics of the consumers in these markets and the growth models actually finding a real kind of a solid development model has not really changed. And so we expect to see a continued increase in loan demand. We expect to see continued increase in capital markets activities. We expect to see continued growth, not only in the Asian markets, but also in the Latin American and some of the African markets. Some of the Eastern European markets are still linked to Europe and that is a longer process. But we remain constructive on the emerging markets, understanding that monetary tightening and other kind of breaks may have to be put on from time to time to manage the overheating that can occur and the inflation that occurs. I think the real question still keeps coming back to the U.S. economy, in our view, and what kind of growth you're going to see and what's going to happen to housing prices and it is still the largest economy in the world and that is going to be something the markets are going to have to watch over the next two, three quarters. And that's why I think, when I started, I said that the macro still going to dominate the micro here for the next two, three quarters.\", \"Sure. I mean, I think first of all, you see our account activity is pretty strong in terms of account opening. Our loan growth continues there. We have seen the linkage between Mexico and the U.S. turnaround the GDP, and we still think that leverage is pretty powerful. And so if the U.S. economy starts doing better, you're going to start to see that in Mexico, as well. Everybody knows the more macro social issues that are occurring there. When you look at our mix of branches, we happen to be in a lot of the major sort of areas. We're everywhere obviously in Mexico but we feel that, given some of the social issues, we're in the right places for capturing the right kind of population there. And so I don't know if there's anything specific you had in mind, but we continue to be very constructive on our business in Mexico, and we're also expecting that business to continue to grow as a result of some of these fundamental turnarounds in the GDP numbers of the country.\", \"No, I'm not going to go into the individual strategy that, that particular desk had employed. But as I said, it generated about $150 million of revenue in the third quarter and virtually $0 million in the fourth.\", \"Let me put it the other way. If you're trying to read anything more systematic into it, there isn't. These are strong businesses, we've got very strong franchises in the local currency areas. As you know, we've got a very strong G10 business. We're building out our Equity business. So we actually remain very positive in terms of the amount and the size of our client, flow of client activity continues to be robust. If you put it all together, again, this is a business that we continue to believe it's going to be a big contributor going forward.\", \"Moshe, that's an important question. The good news is we've got a few quarters to think about it. Because as we said before, this is a 2012 thing and, of course, the usual discussions will apply on stock repurchases versus dividends and all that kind of stuff, and sort of think we should pick up little bit later.\", \"Well, look, I think we're all, I said the next few quarters, now it could be a couple of quarters, but let me say that, again, we've got to watch what happens in the U.S. and that's still the biggest economy. We see a lot of constructive signs. Credit seems to be getting better, as well. But we want to see employment rise. We want to see GDP grow correctly. And these are all going to be important things. If at some point, though, the economy feels like whatever the rate it is at, it's more stable and recovering and is on a trajectory, that takes down a little bit of the uncertainty in the marketplace. And of course, I'm also hoping the next two, three quarters shed some more light in some of the leverage related issues in Europe, as well. And so it just feels to us that when you look at the world and the growth in the emerging markets, when we look at kind of what's going on in Europe and the U.S. that these next few quarters are going to be really important. Now that's not a prediction, that's just a perspective.\"], 'JohnMcDonald': [\"I wanted to try to just ask Betsy's question on the capital just maybe on a slightly different angle. The question comes up a lot on investor conversations. I guess what we struggle with is, you're at the high end of peers on all the capital ratios and most of the other big banks are talking about kind of a medial hopes of capital deployment.

And then how would you advise us to think about the pace of shrink of Citi Holdings over the next 12 months?', 'And then, obviously, as we get to the end of this quarter, you get some sense from the regulators, we think, in terms of what your discussions with regulators are, what they come back to you with in terms of your capital planning. Do you expect to give us more detail on capital planning and on your Bassel III base Tier 1 Common ratio when you report first quarter earnings and will be enabled at that time?'], 'JohnGerspach': ['Thank you, Vikram, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 2. On a full year basis, Citigroup reported revenues of nearly $87 billion for 2010. Operating expenses totaled $47.4 billion. Credit costs were $26 billion, down 50% from prior year levels on a comparable basis. And for the full year, we earned $10.6 billion in net income or $0.35 per diluted share. We earned nearly $15 billion in our core Citicorp business, with earnings in Asia and Latin America contributing more than half of the total. Citi Holdings generated a loss of $4.2 billion.', 'If you think in terms of the way it breaks down, about $150 million of the increase was due to foreign exchange, about $400 million more or less was legal and related matters, $100 million was severance and restructuring and about $150 million each of investment and volume driven growth.', \"Well, as you said, Guy, we don't breakout comp for any of our individual businesses. But, obviously, our comp considerations reflect performance for the full year. Throughout the year, we do our best to estimate what we think we're going to be paying out. So we take all of that into consideration.\", \"There was some contribution in S&B of litigation, but I wouldn't say that S&B was the primary driver behind the $400 million that I talked about earlier.\", \"As we said, I think it was last quarter, we believe that the types of claims associated with private label securitizations are going to manifest themselves in the context of litigation. We made that statement last quarter and that kind of holds true. But as we've said last quarter, to date, we have not received a significant number of claims in connection with private label securitizations. Obviously, we continued to monitor all the activities associated with this, but given the relative lack of historical experience, it naturally kind of follows on that it's difficult to estimate future claims here. So as with all such matters, we're continuing to evaluate our litigation reserves and at the end of the quarter, overall, we feel that we are appropriately reserved and that we're going to continue to monitor everything that's going on with private label securitizations. The other thing, Guy, I think you have to put our position of private label securitizations a bit in context. When you think in terms of the issuances that were done in '05 through '08, we had about a 3% market share and as near as we can tell, we probably ranked eighth among issuers during that time period. Some of our peer institutions have market shares that are 5x or 8x higher than that, so while private label securitizations are something that we obviously are continuing to monitor, it, quite frankly, isn't as big an exposure for us as it might be for others.\", \"Yes, I'm going to take a pass on going through month-to-month performance. But the decline was not due to a decline in customer volume levels. Customer activity stayed pretty solid during the quarter. And as we tried to indicate, it really did reflect just weaker trading performance, especially in the Fixed Income business. As far as what products may have driven it, I would say that G10 Rates probably contributed 2/3, maybe, of the decline, due to the weaker trading performance.\", \"I might comment, Guy, but about half of that decline that we had in the quarter, half of the 12 basis points, was due to the building of the reserve for customer refunds in our Consumer Finance business in Japan. So absent that, the decline in NIM would have been closer to six basis points. And I think that pretty much forms my view as to what might happen going into the first quarter. We could be looking at something in the mid-low digits as far as a decline in NIM. And then maybe it'll stabilize beginning in the second quarter.\", \"A conscious effort on our part. One of the things that I think we mentioned last time is, that we are looking at improving the quality of the deposits that we have. So we actually adjusted our pricing to try to capture more of non-interest bearing and less -- we've got such a good demand for non-interest bearing that there's no need to go out and continue to be in the middle of the pack as far as time deposit pricing. So we've pretty much moved our time deposit pricing down in virtually all regions. And there was also, in North America, there was a bit of a one-time shift that we had between NOW, in NOW accounts, that used to be part of interest-bearing and are now classified as far as non-interest bearing. So that contributed in North America to about $9 billion to $10 billion of the growth there. So it's a conscious trend on our part, but the NOW account shift is a significant one-time item in North America.\", \"Well, don't forget, when we've set up Citicorp and Citi Holdings, it wasn't set up on a good bank, bad bank strategy. It was actually set up, Citicorp represented those businesses that fit the strategy that we have going forward and the businesses that we placed in Citi Holdings, including Retail Partner Cards, for those businesses that just didn't fit. So I would never say never, but what we'd have to look at is to see whether or not Retail Partner Cards or some elements of Retail Partner Cards are now really fitting in with the Citicorp strategy, based upon the re-underwriting of the book and the way that businesses or portfolios in that business are now being managed.\", 'Yes, and we will tend to pace our investment spending based upon the way we see the other investments playing out. So the short answer is, yes, we do have flexibility in our expense base.', \"I'm not so sure of the underlying thesis in your question, which is why I'm having a difficult time answering it, Matt. I'm not sure that our trading is anymore volatile than anybody else's, especially when you eliminate the impact of CVA from it. I think CVA, certainly throughout 2009 and now in the fourth quarter of 2010, maybe has been a bigger contributor to us than to others. Otherwise, I'm not quite sure that we really fall outside the band necessarily.\", \"Well, one quarter doesn't make a trend. And so I think you need to take a look at the overall trading performance over several quarters, if not several years.\", \"Well, tax rates, on a normal basis, if you look at us over time, our expectation is, that our tax rate should be in the upper 20s. 27%, 28% would be the right range. But as long as we are in periods where more of our income is going to be driven by our performance in lower tax rate jurisdictions. In other words, as we're continuing to rebuild the North America business, particularly the earnings stream in North America consumer, our tax rate will be below the numbers that I just quoted.\", \"I would look at it more as a steady state type of thing. I'm not going to say that our expenses are going to be back-end loaded or front-end loaded. I think we'll have a little, obviously, we will look to pace investments based upon where we are. So, if anything, the expenses might tend to be a little back-end loaded, but I don't think it's going to be a huge trend.\", \"Well, as we've always said, when we take a look at reserves, we try to make sure that the reserves reflect the losses that are embedded in those individual portfolios. So as we get more confidence that the losses embedded in that portfolio are truly declining, you're likely to see continued reserve releases. I can't tell you that you're suddenly going to see a $1 billion reserve release. We don't tend to build them in big increments like that, and we don't tend to release them in big increments like that.\", \"Yes, I'm not going to predict operating leverage, especially in a business like Securities and Banking. One thing I'd say is, 2009, I do think we had somewhat outsized performance coming out of the first quarter in 2009. So that clearly is a difficult point of comparison. And, as we've said, our view is that we had weaker trading results in the fourth quarter. We'll see how we performed and our expectation is that we'll pick up that performance during 2011. As far as investments, we've also been, I think, pretty clear that we had made significant investments in building out our Corporate Banking franchise. And earlier in the year, we were still building out equities. We think a lot of equities is now done. The Corporate Banking franchise is still an area where we've got, I think, some work to do, but I think most of the investment work in Securities and Banking now is behind us.\", \"When you take a look at -- you're talking about the investment Securities, the AFS, right?\", \"We are in the midst of repositioning that book, given the rate environment. I'm not going to make a public statement as to where we think rates are going, but it's just that obviously we did take some of the Securities off the table and that's one of the reasons why our cash balances are higher right now. And so you'll see the results of that repositioning as we get further into the first quarter.\", \"Yes, we've always said that proprietary trading or principal positions is a relatively small part of our overall business. We've said publicly that proprietary trading represents less than 2% of our firm revenues. And there is a small prop business that's in equities. During the third quarter, it generated revenues of about $150 million and virtually generated no revenues in the fourth quarter. So that's $150 million out of the $250 million overall decline in our Equity Markets revenues x CVA, quarter-on-quarter.\", 'You take a look at the other comprehensive income, the AOCI, as you say. Two big drivers there. One would be losses on the AFS Securities. That was about $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion of a negative. And then we had a positive pick up on the currency translation adjustment that was worth about $400 million going the other way.', 'The single largest driver would be net income in our North America operations. When you take a look at the breakdown of the DTA, we ended the quarter with DTA of about $52 billion. $5 billion of that is state and local, $5 billion of that is international, so $42 billion is really U.S. federal tax. And the single largest driver there is generating more profits in North America.', \"I'm sorry, do I have any what?\", \"Well, what we've said is that, at least from the impacts of Dodd-Frank that are measurable right now, the change in FDIC assessment is the single largest impact on us. We don't have much of an impact on debit card interchange or overdraft fees. Those are really small impacts on us. But the way that the FDIC has proposed changing its formula will impact all the large banks dramatically -- have a greater dramatic impact on the large banks than it will on the small banks. So our assessment right now is based upon the rules. We're looking at almost a doubling of the FDIC assessment.\", \"Of course, it depends upon exactly when in '11 it goes into effect. So depending upon if it's a second quarter item than it would be three quarters. You can do the math.\", 'We ended with about $52 billion of DTA and $35 billion of that was disallowed in coming up with our Tier 1 Common ratio.', \"I wouldn't say that the European peripheral countries were a significant contributor to any of our trading results. So you can sort of take that one off the table. Again, when you take a look at the trading performance, first quarter '09, I think we all had the same thing. A very, very strong quarter in the first quarter of '09. And that one kind of -- that's going to be something that's going to be very difficult to replicate. And then each quarter sort of tends to tell its own story. As I mentioned, this quarter, our weaker trading was actually concentrated in the Rates and Currency business, particularly the G10 Rates business in fixed income. But there's no indication that there's anything systemic in those numbers.\", \"It's primarily associated with our market making activities as we were trying to facilitate client needs. And if clients were reacting to rising rates, then we were certainly on the other side of that.\", \"Well, again, the $255 million you are talking about is the adjustment that we made to build additional reserves for potential client refunds in our CFJ business. That's a reserve that we have adjusted periodically for four, five years now at this point in time. So again, as we see changes in the market this particular quarter, the build is really associated with what we thought might be an uptick in refund requests related to the talk of Fuji bankruptcy that occurred. So it was really in response to a specific event.\", \"I've just got to correct you just a little bit, Chris. Going into 2010, our guidance was full year expenses of $48 billion to $50 billion. By the second half of the year, we said we thought individual quarters for the second half of 2010 would be $11.5 billion to $12 billion. So we really weren't at an $11.5 billion guidance. And so as we've look ahead to next year, again, we're just trying to be consistent with where we were, quite frankly at the beginning of last year, which is as we look at the overall year, it's $48 billion to $50 billion of total expense. We ended this year with $47.4 billion. So it's not all that much different.\", \"That's correct.\", \"The first one, no, as I said, we're targeting to be at that 8% to 9% range in 2012. As far as the second, look, if you take a look at the assets that are left in Citi Holdings, and we laid them out for you in the deck, we're not likely to maintain the same pace that we had in 2010. Specifically, again, Brokerage and Asset Management which has got roughly $26 billion, $27 billion of assets, that's virtually all tied up in the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney joint venture. And so that's an event as opposed to something that we're going to just wind our way down over the next several quarters. Special Asset Pool is about $80 billion of assets now. We've taken that down dramatically. But now, roughly a third of the remaining Special Asset Pool assets are hold to maturity assets. And so the pace of the reduction in the Special Asset Pool is also going to slow because we just don't have as much inventory, quite frankly, push out. And then you get to the last component and the Local Consumer Lending and more than half of the remaining assets are tied up in U.S. mortgages. And I don't see a big one-time sale of U.S. mortgages. We will continue to sell down assets at a pace, but it's not likely that we're going to find a $20 billion to $30 billion sale on our doorstep at any sort of rational terms in the near-term. So the pace is going to slow from where we've been in 2010 .\", \"Ed, that's kind of unlikely. I mean, unless we significantly change our position as to our view towards 2012 being the year that we'd be looking to return capital, it's not likely that we'd be changing anything else.\", \"Yes, the $3 billion to $4 billion still holds. We actually have been, or have begun, that investment spending, and I think we mentioned the fact that as early as the first quarter of this year of 2010, we had some elements of it in place. Although it certainly picked up pace as we got later into the year. When you look at the fourth quarter, Mike, I mentioned $150 million being the linked quarter-on-quarter impact of investment spending, it's safe to say that something on the order of $300 million to $400 million of our expense base in the fourth quarter represented investment spending.\", 'Well, $3 billion to $4 billion would be the total amount of spending.', \"That's about it.\", \"Well, if you're at a run rate of $1.2 billion for a quarter, for a year, I should say, that would mean that over something like three years then, you would be within that $3 billion to $4 billion range, right?\", 'Exactly.', \"Mike, as you probably well know, we can't comment on any conversations that we have with our regulators.\", 'Well, the biggest impact for us was the adoption of 166, 167 in the first quarter. That added $4.3 billion, $4.4 billion to the DTA asset.', \"Don't forget then, also, besides earnings, you've got the impact of the AFS portfolio, we had losses on the AFS portfolio this quarter. I mentioned that in response to another question. When you think about driving down the DTA, the key component for us is actually to reduce the amount of the DTA that's represented by net operating loss carry forwards. And we've actually taken that down during the year. We started the year with, I think just a little bit north of $5 billion of NOL carry forward. And we'll end the year with about $2.3 billion, maybe $2.2 billion of NOL carry forward. And so once we work our way through that and actually in the Q, I believe the third quarter Q, we actually gave you disclosure that our expectation is that we will be through the NOL carry forward during 2011. And once we work our way through that, then it'll become easier to deal with the foreign tax credit carry forwards, which are the largest piece of our DTA.\", \"I didn't catch the last question. Are we appropriately matched? The impact on revenues and expenses has got less to do with matching assets and liabilities. I mean, the assets and liabilities. . .\", \"And I think in some of the commentary that we gave you, on the international, Regional Consumer Banking franchises, we've mentioned that FX changes drove some of the revenue increase. The revenue was up about 4% and FX probably drove more than half of that. But when you take a look at all of our businesses, we operate in many different currencies around the world. And so FX, overall, has really got a very small impact on our bottom line. And it tends to work its way out as far as revenues expense and NCLs. But when you get into individual lines, FX can be a driver of variance, just in those individual lines.\", \"Yes, and Carole, as a matter of fact, what we've done in the past, we indicated at the end of June that the risk-weighted assets in Citi Holdings represented about 40% of our risk-weighted assets, at that point in time. We then, in September, told you that Citi Holdings risk-weighted assets were down to 37% of our total risk-weighted assets. And by the end of the year, our current estimate is, that the Citi Holdings risk-weighted assets will be about 34% of our total risk-weighted assets. So think in terms of Citi Holdings representing 19% of our GAAP assets and roughly estimated 34% of our risk-weighted assets.\", \"Well, you're right, we do have a lot of cash on the balance sheet and in response to one of the earlier questions, we touched on the fact that there's actually been a decline in our available-for-sale securities during the quarter as we've begun to reposition that portfolio, given the current rate environment. So a little bit of the incremental cash that we have on the books right now is really being driven just because we're in the midst of repositioning that AFS portfolio debt.\", \"As we entered 2010, we comment on the fact that we were deliberately liquid at that point in time and we felt that it was prudent to remain liquid throughout 2010. That gives us a certain amount of flexibility for two things. One, clearly, as our debt now begins to mature and we do have debt sizable amounts of our long-term debt maturing during 2011, we'll have less of a need to roll over that debt. So one of the things that you'll see is our long-term debt begin to go down. That will consume some of that cash. The second is, we are open for business and we're looking to build the loan book in both our Consumer and our Corporate businesses. And so our expectation is that we'll begin to put some of that liquidity to work in 2011.\", \"Yes, our deposit to loan ratio, I'd like to say I tend to think that the other way right now is about 139% or 140%. That's higher than we would expect to be in a long-term basis.\", \"No, there's been no change in our appetite.\", \"I think you asked about deposits. We, right now, again, given where we are from a liquidity point of view, we obviously will be there for our customers to accept deposits, but one of the things that we're focused on right now is addressing, I'm going to call it the quality and the pricing of our deposits. So we are deliberately shifting out of pricing to capture time deposits. And I think you've seen some of the beginnings of that in some of the ships in our interest-bearing deposits, both in the U.S. and in our branches outside the U.S. That's reflected on the face of the balance sheet right now. So we'll look to maintain steady deposits, but try to improve the mix.\"], 'JohnAndrews': ['Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you everyone this morning for joining us.

Afterwards, they will be happy to take your questions. '], 'MichaelMayo': [\"In November, Citi gave a presentation where you guys said you'll increase investment spending for consumer by $3 billion to $4 billion over the next three years. And can you give us more color when we should see that hit? How much a hit this quarter? I know you said $150 million of the linked quarter increase was due to increased investments and volume related matters, so I'm guessing it hasn't really hit yet. And how much of your expense guidance for the year includes some of this additional investment spending?\", 'That we should see that increase by another $2.6 billion over the next three years?', 'So you got a run rate now of $1.2 billion?', 'So you have another $2 billion more for this investment spending, is that fair to say?', 'So this is just a one-time step up and you maintain that higher level?', 'And then separately, it came out last week that you have an MOU with the regulators. How big a deal is this in your mind? Is it simply backwards looking for some of the problems from a couple of years ago or is this still something you need to wrestle with? You highlighted some risk management issues that you still had to resolve.', \"And then a separate question would be, for the DTAs you earned $10 billion last year on GAAP earnings, but the DTA level still went up to $52 billion as you pointed out. In layman's terms, why does the DTA keep going up even while you have positive GAAP earnings? I know you mentioned some of that is geography, but what are some of the other reasons why it still goes up?\", \"But it's still leaking upward here even in the past couple of quarters.\", 'And then last question for Vikram, you lead off the conference call saying macro trends should dominate micro trends the next couple of quarters. I was just curious why you mentioned the next couple quarters in particular?'], 'AndreaJao': ['First on trading equities and on the fixed income and equities trading businesses, have there been changes in your appetite for taking risk or committing capital as you facilitate customer transactions? Then I have a follow-up regarding the balance sheet.', 'How should I think about the balance sheet by the  end of 2011? Just thinking back to the previous question by Dick, excess liquidity will be replaced by higher loans and less borrowings. How about deposits in your securities book?'], 'JohnAndrewas': ['Thank you, everyone, for committing so much time this morning on a rather lengthy call. Obviously, this will be available for replay on the website later this afternoon and if you have follow-up questions, contact to the IR team here at Citi. Thank you.'], 'RichardBove': [\"I'd like to ask you the same question I asked JPMorgan but in the opposite direction. They've got a negative federal funds plus cash position when divided by assets. You now have roughly 12.9% of your balance sheet on the asset side in cash, plus a positive net fed funds position. Why is it so big? I mean, you're only getting about a 79 basis point return on that money, which must be having an impact on your net interest margin. Could you kind of give me your thinking on this?\", \"If we go back in time, that percentage should be somewhere around 3% or 4% and it would be because, generally speaking, Citigroup always had a negative federal funds position, it's almost shocking to see it with a $57 billion of a net positive federal funds position. And cash has never been this high as a percentage of assets. So one might argue that on a ratio basis, you're 3x higher as a percentage of assets than you would normally be. So just selling off some securities last quarter had no real impact on what I'm talking about.\", \"So it's fair to state that if you start to utilize that excess cash to lend, and if your loan to deposit ratio starts to move up, I'm going to say, again, to more normal levels, that this represents tremendous excess earnings capacity at the moment?\"], 1: defaultdict(<type 'list'>, {'MikeMayo': [\"Hi, I'm trying to reconcile two thoughts; the positive thought comes from the CEO letter, where Mike you say, all that we accomplished over the last two years has been in preparation for this year. That's a pretty positive statement, but then I've heard a few I think negative statements on the call; the ICG efficiency ratio was 51% in the first quarter, and you're guiding the 55% for the year. So I guess that won't maintain. Trading typically peaks in the first quarter. You talked about a lower margin after the asset sale, so is this as good as it gets, or is this a false start for Citigroup, or is there a lot more ahead?\", \"Got it, that addresses the operating efficiency. On capital efficiency, Mike, you said that you don't really believe in a lot of one-off to buyback capital, but you can now repurchase stock, which is different; actually if you could let us know when you're allowed to start buying back stock, and also if you can buyback stock at such a discount to tangible book value, why wouldn't you sell off additional non-core assets? I mean if it was me I could -- if I could buy dollar bills for a discount, I'd be buying as many as I could. I mean I'm looking at my office, I'd be selling my water bottle, my stapler, you know, maybe my desk chair, I'd stand -- I'd do whatever I could to raise that additional capital buyback stock and I'd make the request to regulators. And the question before, why not take the proceeds from OneMain or anything else that you can sell for a gain and buyback stock right now?\", 'All right, thank you.'], 'EricWasserstrom': ['Thanks very much.', 'Hi, how are you, John? Just a couple of questions; first, as it relates to the Costco portfolio, can you just describe how the price discovery works on that?', \"And I guess what I'm trying to just understand is to the extent that there is obviously a difference in view on pricing, how does that -- what is the mechanism for resolution?\", 'Okay.', \"Okay. And then on a different topic, and there has obviously been some press speculation about legal authority and their interest in getting one of your legal entities to plead guilty to an issue. And I guess I'm not asking obviously to comment directly on that, but I guess my question is to the extent that, that does happen for your banking entity in the United States, how does the investment community think about the operational risk that, that creates for you? For example, does it create risk to your licenses? Does it create risk to certain counterparties who may or may not be able to interact with you on a go-forward basis? How do we frame our understanding of those risks?\", 'Okay, I understood. Thanks very much.'], 'JohnGerspach': [\"Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 3, I'd like to highlight a couple of items; CVA/DVA, and a prior period tax change that affect the comparability of our results to last year. Excluding these items, we earned $1.52 per share in the recent quarter, compared to $1.30 in the first quarter of 2014.\", \"Yes, John, as we ended the fourth quarter of 2014, I think what we told you then is that all the repositioning actions that we had taken during the previous nine quarters we expected to generate cost savings, annual cost savings of about $3.4 billion. And as of the fourth quarter of last year, about $2.7 billion of those cost saves were already embedded in our expense base. That left about $700 billion of annual saves to realize then during 2015. And in the first quarter we generated an additional -- just over $200 million of that remaining $700 million. So we've got some more to go this year, but we feel pretty good about the level of expenses that we're currently running at.\", \"No, we don't -- I wouldn't say it's typically higher in the first quarter, it's a little bit higher maybe in the first quarter, but pretty much, expenses stay fairly consistent during the course of the year, again depending on certain fluctuations or episodic items. You saw at the end of last year we had some expense growth associated with our focus on CCAR. So those items do give us some quarterly fluctuations, but again, I think the first quarter is a pretty good jumping-off point for the rest of the year.\", 'Yes, well, John, what we said even in the earnings release that -- not in the earnings release, even in the press release that we put out in connection with signing the deal for OneMain Financial is that our intent is to invest some of the gains that we get from that sale to redeem high cost debt that are used to fund the businesses. Redeeming that, that high cost debt will then serve to improve the NIM, somewhat mitigate the impact of the NIM loss from OneMain.', \"Well, when you take a look at holdings, we -- again, our commitment to holdings is to be able to run that business at least on a breakeven basis over a full year period, and we believe that even with the sales that we've got lined up for the balance of this year, we still should be able to produce holdings at breakeven during the balance of this year and into next year.\", \"Well, we don't go into deal-by-deal basis on these things. Holdings, at the end of the first quarter has got about a $179 billion worth of risk weighted assets, now about $49 billion of those assets though are op risk assets, so individual sales are not going to impact op risks. So, say, you've got a $130 billion dollars of mostly credit risk, some market risk, but mostly credit risk, risk weighted assets sitting there in Citi Holdings, and if you think about the businesses that we've got on tab, including OneMain and Japan, they total as we said about $32 billion worth of GAAP assets, but on a risk weighted asset basis, it's much lower than that. They only account for about $16 billion worth of the risk weighted assets, and that's just because of the concentration of HQLA [ph] type assets that are concentrated in Japan.\", \"Yes, I'd say that our commentary would be similar. There certainly is a lower demand. Some of the trade finance businesses obviously is in connection with energy-related type of projects. So when you get the price of oil dropping by 50%, you are going to have a significant drop in your demand for trade finance.\", \"I'd say still the U.S. mortgage portfolio in Citi Holdings, you can see that it's got the lion share of the GAAP assets, and in similar fashion, it has the lion share of the remaining risk weighted assets.\", \"Well, we've done there some opportunistic asset sales. We continue to run that portfolio down. You've seen the reduction that we achieved in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. So that's a combination, both of pay downs as well as asset sales, and we will continue to do that where the economics makes sense.\", \"Yes, the bulk of the remaining annualized savings, and I want to just be clear, Betsy, that roughly 500, little bit less than 500 -- that's on an annualized basis. So you'll get that in the expense based during the remaining three quarters, but that will show itself. But the bulk of those savings are split between comp costs as well as real estate costs, because we got real estate actions that we've also got embedded as we continue to take streamlining actions. We're consolidating sites along with some of the personnel actions that we've taken. So you'll see it on both the occupancy line as well as on the compensation lines.\", 'Our overall guidance has been that we expect legal and repositioning costs to run about 200 basis points with Citicorp. And we said that was a pretty good target to go forward for 2015. So when you look at the overall level of legal and repositioning in the quarter, I think it ran something like a 175 basis points. So roughly in line with that 200 basis point target. Well, I think that during the course of the year, you will continue to see some level of repositioning; even in this quarter, while Citicorp I think shows a repositioning charge of one, there was actually gross repositioning charges of something around $30 million, but that was largely offset by the release of some previously established repositioning reserves from prior periods. But we still will continue to do some repositioning. But yes, we do think that the bulk -- certainly the largest portion of our repositioning efforts are behind us.', \"I'd say that we got a little over 200 million in the first quarter. There's probably a little bit more to come that will be -- you'll see in the third quarter with the second and fourth quarter somewhat evenly split.\", 'Very well.', \"Mike, let me just -- the other things, I just want to make sure that you picked up on some of the other things we've talked about, which is that, we did recognize that we had headwinds in our international consumer business during this first quarter as well. So in a quarter where we had headwinds in both our trading performance as well as in international consumer, we still are able to post overall strong results.\", \"Thanks, Steve. I'd say it's pretty clear that we have moved up to afford it to the 4% bucket. I mean that's certainly our estimation, just given -- again, given the change in exchange rates and everything else we'll get confirmation of that, but we're pretty sure that we're in that 4% bucket under the current proposed rules. And we'll have to see how those play out.\", \"I believe that there were a series of comment letters already submitted to the Fed, and I'm sure that the Fed is giving those due consideration.\", \"Steven, so the updated number that I mentioned earlier is we would say that of the $179 billion at the end of the first quarter of risk weighted assets that's in Holdings, that $49 billion of that is op risk. And right on to your point, we don't expect that op risk RWA to dissipate just because we've gotten rid of the Holdings' assets. That will stay with us for sometime. I can't tell you how long, but it will be with us for sometime.\", 'Thank you, Steven.', 'Yes, good afternoon.', \"Well, we're concentrated around those seven cities. Are there still some branches outside those seven cities that we might consider doing some further pruning on? Perhaps, and there's probably other opportunities that we have to open up additional outlets in some of those seven cities as well. So the number 788 that we currently have, that could go up a little, could go down a little, I wouldn't necessarily just focus on it, but again whatever we do, we will be consistent with that strategy of concentrating our efforts on those seven urban areas.\", \"Under the CCAR, the thing that -- the CCAR submittal, we've already received approval over the next five quarters to buyback about $7.8 billion of our stock. And so, those actions are currently underway, as Mike indicated earlier, beginning on April 1 as to whether or not we would do anything specific with the OneMain gain, while it's probably too early to give you a definitive answer, I would not expect us to.\", 'I think at the start of the year, we were looking at something around 26,000, may be a little bit over that. So I think in terms of slightly more than 10%-12% growth during the course of the year.', \"I'm not going to address the 60,000 number that you just drew out, but now I can't give you a specific cost of that. We've made comments that obviously the cost associated with regulatory and compliance efforts has continued to increase. It's consumed a fairly significant portion of the efficiency savings that we've been generating in the business. We've given you that math before. We've said that, of the $3.4 billion of expense saves that we expect to get in specifically of the now $2.9 billion of expense saves that we've gotten through our efficiency efforts, approximately 50% of those savings are being consumed by additional investments that we're making in regulatory and compliance activities.\", \"I think as we've shown, Gerard, we're always willing and interested to look at assets at the right price, so, if things fit in strategy, happy to look at it, but I don't see us breaking into new areas that we're not already in.\", \"I don't believe that is within the rule. They may seek additional commentary to other means, but I don't believe that while the comment and review period is underway that they can have individual discussions. But again, I'm not a rules expert.\", \"Sorry, Matt; can't do that one. I'll give you the usual line, if you call our crack IR staff after the completion of this call, they will get you that information. I apologize.\", \"I can't recall the exact size. It was a fairly sizable number, something like a $130 billion or so. Again, we can get you the exact number. Again, that's more reflective of some of the deposit taking activities that are resident in the transaction services business. While we had the -- they tend to generate then high quality liquid assets that we hold, we were -- those things used to be resident in our corp other segment. And so, we felt that there was a better measurement to act from a performance point of view to actually push those assets into the business themselves. And I think you can see that it's had a small impact on the capital than attributed to ICG. That capital is up a couple of billion dollars from quarter-to-quarter. It's going to drive down their ROA. But we think it's a better measure of what the real ROA is that we have coming out of that business.\", \"No. From a Citicorp, or from a city group point of view, it's a right pocket left pocket, we just thought that it was a better way of measuring performance.\", 'Not a problem.', 'Thank you, Erika.', \"Yes. I mean we still look -- obviously -- globally, GDP growth is less than what we would hope for, and I don't think we are alone in that, but we still see good opportunities in markets; India for instance, is doing very well. It's likely that India is going to emerge as the economy with the strongest GDP growth this year as it outdistances China, but we continue to invest on our franchises throughout Asia, and we are getting good driver growth, the deposit levels, the loan levels; so we feel really good about the strength of our overall Asia franchise. Unlike so many other things these are patches that we have to manage our way through, where you are going to get some regulatory headwinds, you are going to have some slowdown in GDP, so that might mitigate some of the -- it might cause you to lessen the pace of some of your investments in those countries, but it doesn't stop the fact that we are still looking to grow our Asia consumer business.\", 'Yes, very much so, very much so.', 'Okay.', 'Hi, Eric.', \"I'm not quite sure that we've released the contractual terms on that, but just to say that there is a process put in place by which a purchase price can be set between the two parties, and we ultimately feel that we will reach agreement on an appropriate purchase price, because we think it's in both of our best interest to have the portfolio transferred.\", 'There is a mechanism, and mechanism leads to a choice as to whether or not the portfolio ultimately is transferred.', \"Although we don't think that's where it's going to go.\", \"Eric, we don't comment on individual litigation or regulatory matters. Our specific reserving actions unless it's related to specific settlements that we are announcing and since we don't comment on these things because they ultimately are hypotheticals, I'm really not going to comment then on your hypothetical.\", 'All right.', \"Your last one, the constraining factor is the cost of the redemption. So if I've got a $100 million dollar gain, I should be able to retire debt that would generate a $100 million loss that would cancel out the gain and the loss, producing a zero impact on net income, and we would have the ongoing benefit of the debt being retired, therefore lessening interest charges in the future periods.\", 'Either one.', 'Okay.', \"I just want to be clear; I mean the comments that I made as far as the balance sheet size is related to this year. I'm not saying that we will never grow the balance sheet in '16, '17, '18; that was a very specific comment as related to the other comments on the balance of the year. It will be doubtful that any significant portfolio of assets we would actually be able to close on this year. So the guidance stays for this year.\", \"Is there what, I'm sorry?\", \"Oh, yes, no, no, no. There's no gain associated with the movement from -- into held-for-sale.\", 'Not a problem.'], 'KenUsdin': [\"Thanks. Hi, Mike and John. A question on just CCAR and the limitations, it's clear that CET 1 was not so much limited [ph] as much as Tier 1 in total. You guys have previously talked about raising about 4 billion preferred this year as a helper on that side of things. I'm just wondering just post this year CCAR, can you give us some thoughts about just the outcomes around limitations and any views that you might have that maybe different around the magnitude of preferred issuance you might need to think about for this year and looking ahead?\", \"Okay, understood; great. And then second question, you spoke to the drag that have been impacting the international consumer businesses from the spread compression and the regulatory changes, can you talk a little bit more about just qualitatively the international markets, LATAM and Asia, and any impact you are seeing from FX not so much in the translation effects because that's pretty clear that that's a net neutral, but just in terms of the economies in general, organic and secure growth, and how you are feeling about those businesses? Thanks.\", \"And then, last just clarification, John, you earlier had mentioned that maybe China offset, or keep key holdings profitable on a yearly basis this year into next year, and I'm just wondering is the potential debt pay down considered after the sale of OneMain considered in the helping part of next year as well?\", 'Okay, understood. Thank you.'], 'JimMitchell': ['Hey, good morning guys.', 'Maybe just a question on the big jump in the SLR, that seems to imply, if my math is right, that you made some progress on the denominator. I guess, first, is that the case? And does that have also positive implications for the Tier 1 leverage in CCAR when we think about next year, or is that just purely an SLR phenomenon?', \"Do you think there's more to go there?\", \"Yep. Fair enough. Maybe just a follow-up question on fixed income; you guys, and I think some others have mentioned a slow start, particularly in spread products. Maybe if you can give us a sense, you've disclosed the [indiscernible] rates and effects as a bigger proportion of your business, and some others you had a competitor today show significant, or decent year-over-year growth in FIC despite arguably a lower concentration in FX and rates and a similar decline in spread products. So I'm just trying to get a sense, was it really the issue with the Swiss franc, or just had a particularly bad, tough time in spread products; just trying to get a sense why we wouldn't have seen a little bit more of a improved result there?\", 'Sure', \"That's all fair. I appreciate the color. Just any more color on how things progress throughout the quarter.

Good afternoon, guys.', \"John, you mentioned that your deposits per branch here in the States I think were up 20% even though you've obviously downsized the branch structure that you have here in the States. Are you now at the optimal level in the seven cities that you've identified, or is there further reductions that we should expect?\", 'Following up on your comments that you talked about with after OneMain is sold, obviously the NIM will come under some pressure, but you do get the capital gain hopefully from the sale, and you can pay down some of your high cost debt. Will some of the gain be also used for stock repurchases, or is it all just to reduce that higher cost debt?', \"Okay. Early in your comments, I think you guys said that by the end of the year, you might have about 30,000 folks working in regulatory and compliance. Where's that number today?\", 'And do you guys have a ballpark and what that cost is, if you use an average salary of 60,000 or something like that for the folks that are in that division or that group?', \"Okay, thanks.

And just one follow-up question; was there any gain from moving out OneMain and the held-for-sale?', 'Any gain from moving -- you said I think the OneMain operations have moved the held-for-sale?', 'Okay, thank you.'], 'A-': [\"Sure, John. Starting with CCAR, I think it was -- first off, I should preface it by saying that not only we believe the industry or the submitting banks haven't yet received formal response in terms of feedback, and so we've gotten verbal response, but I would categorize the responses we've received so far as having put a lot of work into it, made a tremendous amount of progress, but on an industry basis the large SIFI banks have more work to do. We've recognized we have more work to do, and we view 2015 as an important year to do that. And Barbara Besoer, and the team are obviously committed to doing that.\", \"Second quarter -- I'm sorry, third quarter, John.\", 'Good morning, Jim.', \"No, it's primarily focused on SLR, and we did make progress in reducing the denominator of SLR, that will have knock-on effects against other ratios. And again, it's just something that we are focused on. It's against all categories of the various SLR computation. And so it does have knock-on effects for other calculations.\", \"Well, we're always looking to optimize. I feel pretty good about where we are right now, at 6.4%, but we'll always strive to run the most efficient balance sheet that we can.\", \"Yes, well, Jim, as you know, I mean when you're trying to do growth rates, or you're trying to do anything year-on-year, you have to look at the composition of both periods.\", \"And so, if you go back to the first quarter of '14 that was on a relative basis compared to our peers, a very strong quarter for our FIC businesses. It was especially strong for us in spread products. The first quarter of '14 gives us a tough comp. Spread products, historically, have accounted for about 40% of our FIC revenues, but if I look back to the first quarter of '14, spread product revenues was significantly above that level.\", \"It was a slow start and things evened out during the course of the quarter, but I wouldn't say that we finished with a big upswing in spread products.\", 'Okay.', 'Hi, Matt.', 'Good morning.', \"Matt, I missed you. I'm sorry, there was -- what was down, 500 million; I'm sorry?\", \"Q-on-Q, well, don't forget there is a two-day impact. The fourth quarter has got 92 days in it; the first quarter has 90 days.\", \"There's going to be some impact on that as well. You can see the -- on a constant dollar basis, you can see the comparison in net interest revenue per day on slide 17, and as you can see on a per day basis, fourth quarter on constant dollars, first quarter net interest revenue is spot on with the net interest revenue that we had in the fourth quarter of last year. \", \"I hate to get that deep into it, Matt. The expectation is that NIM is going to be down, as it has been every second quarter for the last couple of years, down two to three basis points. There's a certain amount of seasonality in that. You can see though, again, if you look back, as far as our net interest revenue per day, it stays pretty constant. So that's more of a denominator factor than anything else.\", \"Matt, I would say we feel quite good. As you referenced, we made some material changes to management leadership in Mexico, both from an operations and from a control perspective and feel like we've got the right people in place. We did fairly broad-sweeping reviews of our control processes in Mexico. And as we've said, as a company, we are extremely bullish on the economic prospects of Mexico, and Banamex's position in terms of helping to fuel that growth for the country. We see a lot of opportunity in Mexico.\", \"No, Matt. That will happen during the ensuing couple of quarters and we'll put those details out when they are available.\", 'All right, thanks, Matt.', 'Yes. You know Matt, as we -- not Matt, Glenn; sorry. You just overwhelmed me with what you liked, and I was focusing on that.', \"Yes, yes, yes. Look, as going into the year, what we said was that we were expecting a continuation of the difficult environment that we experienced in 2014, and unfortunately, I think that's where we're heading into; certainly that's the way 2015 is playing out. We weren't expecting to be bailed out by any sort of significant rate increase, and again it doesn't look like that's going to happen. So we said that we thought that our Citi core businesses could generate low-to-mid single-digit revenue growth this year just based upon the fundamentals, and that is, in effect, what we experienced in the first quarter, with a 2% growth rate in Citicorp.\", \"One, I wouldn't even propose putting on hedges for rules that are not even fully baked in yet, so\", \"That's not something we're looking at. The difficulty with anything to do with the G-SIB calculation is that, not only is it linked to changes in the FX rate, it's linked to what 79 other banks are doing, and I don't know how to put a hedge on against 79 banks' activities. That's just not something that I know how to control at this point in time. From an overall, what we can focus on, what we do know what to do, is hedge the CET 1 ratio, and you can see, again, that despite all their fluctuations in the dollar, it had zero impact on our CET 1 ratio. We laid that out for you in Slide 37 in the back of the deck.\", \"We've been actively managing the exposure, obviously, to Russia on an ongoing basis and -- excuse me I apologize. As you can -- As you have seen, we've continued to manage down the exposure that we have in Russia. The consumer business in Russia is actually performing, I'd say, better than what we had expected; so that's good. When it comes to energy-related matters, we gave you a lot of details as far as our energy exposures when we did fourth quarter last year. Well, we'll give you more details on that when we do the Fixed Income Investor Presentation next week, but in general, our energy-related exposures on a funded basis are steady, fourth quarter to first quarter. Total exposure is down slightly. We mentioned last quarter that about 85% of our exposure energy companies was investment grade. We had some minor downgrades in that, but I think it's reduced by a couple of 300 basis points, or maybe it's down to 82%, so it's still very strong.\", 'Not a problem, Glenn.', \"If you look at our franchise in Argentina, we just in actually 2014 celebrated our 100th anniversary of being in the country and it's a place that we've got a history franchise. Clearly, we're challenged that today, or if you go back to March 12, sitting between the district court ruling here in the U.S. and the Argentine government is not a place we want to be. And as a result of finding ourselves in that position, made the decision on our own that we would like to exit the custody business. And so, we are in conversations with the Argentine government in terms of trying to execute against that process. Many of these things are complicated, but we think that's the best course of action for us to take.\", 'Absolutely. Limited to the custody business.', 'Yes, no problem.', \"Well, Mike, I would say that you're right, there is cyclicality to the business, but if you look at the quarter I think there's a couple of stories or a couple of themes in here that are important to call out. John talked about the diversification of our earnings base, and if you look at the banking piece of it, we had good earnings growth in banking at the same time offsetting some softness around parts of our markets business, if you look at what's going on in terms of North American consumer.\", \"Well, two things. One is we have started buying back stocks. Our permission gave us the ability to start that on April 1, and we did. So that's underway. And I think if you've seen, Mike, we've been very disciplined, and I think quite transparent in terms of the way we look at our businesses. And those businesses that over the intermediate term, we don't believe there's a pathway to be accretive to our franchise in the industry. You've seen us take action against those. And so we'll continue to review those, but we believe today that franchise away from holdings has largely positioned the way we'd like it to be. And if you look at the returns of those businesses, both institutional and consumer, they're accretive to our shareholders.\", 'All right.', \"No, we still think that $4 billion is about the right level of issuance that we'll have this year. We'll give you further guidance next week when we conduct the Fixed Income call, but I don't expect that number to increase. The important thing about the CCAR, don't forget CCAR is an exercise that goes out over nine quarter. And so it's really what gets reflected in the various CCAR calculations is the totality of your capital plan, including issuances as well as redemption, the use of capital repurchases over that nine-quarter period. We're still comfortable with the guidance that we'd given as far as the level of preferred stock issuance that we need to do.\", \"We would say that there is something that we think is extraordinary and creates real value. We would certainly be willing to put that on if it's accretive in the ways we want a look at it, but the other levers we pull is that we've maintained a flat balance sheet while investing in our business in loan growth by the continued shrinkage of holding. So depending on the size of the asset and the nature of it, we might be able to create room through holdings, or if it works extraordinary or something we thought of merit, we could certainly add it to the balance sheet.\"], 'MikeCorbat': [\"Susan, thank you. Good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported earnings of $4.8 billion for the first quarter of 2015, or $1.52 per share, excluding the impact of CVA and DVA. It was a strong quarter overall, and we accomplished a great deal by executing against our top strategic priorities. We tightly managed our expenses, helping to achieve positive operating leverage in Citicorp, and we're on track to hit our financial targets for the year.\"], 'Question-and-AnswerSession': ['Operator'], 'GlennSchorr': [\"Hello there, thanks. So I liked the improvement on the efficiency ratio targets, and liked the commitment to the target ranges.

A strong dollar didn't seem to have a huge P&L impact, and broke all out -- you broke out for us all the places that hit both revenue and expenses. It also impacts the G-SIB buffer, and I know those rules aren't finalized, but is there a way to hedge that, or do you give up P&L neutrality if you wind up hedging that as an either/or scenario?\", 'Yes.', \"Yes, I appreciate that. Last one, on credit, which has also been great. I'm just curious if there's anything within, whether it would be Russia/Ukraine exposure, or energy exposure that is getting internal rankings going higher, or should I say internal downgrades that we should be thinking about throughout this year.\", 'Great I appreciate all that, thanks.'], 'BrennanHawken': [\"Good morning, guys.

Thanks for that, John. And then, how about on the capital front, can you help us think about what potential capital impact might come from those deals?', \"That's helpful. And then, you mentioned, John, I believe a decline in trade revenues, we heard -- a competitor mentioned lower demand in trade finance, could you give maybe a little bit of colour around that business and what trends you are seeing there?\", \"Okay, that's helpful. Last one from me, Argentina, we've seen a lot of noise coming out of the situation there with the bond payments and the like, is that just how you think about that market from here?\", 'And limit it to the custody business at this stage?', 'Terrific. Thanks for all the color.'], 'StevenChubak': [\"Have you had any dialog with regulators with regards to the approach, and whether -- it seems fairer balance giving some of those FX considerations as well as the fact that it's a relative calculation as you noticed?\", \"Understood; and maybe just one more on risk weighted assets, also follow-up to Betsy's question with regards to Holdings' RWA specifically; just looking at some of the 10-K disclosure that you guys provided, it looks like 30% of Holdings' RWA consists of operational risks, so call it $54 billion or so. And just given the long look back for op risk, I just want to get a better understanding as to what happens in an accelerated unwind of Holding? Should we expect that 5 to 6 billion of capital is actually released, or does it persist or linger because of the significant look back?\", \"Okay, that's really helpful. Thanks, John, and congratulations on a strong quarter.\"], 'JohnMcDonald': ['Hi, good morning, John. I had a question on the expenses. In terms of the core expenses, trying to get a sense of how much of your cost saves you achieved this quarter are reflected in the core operating expense, somewhere at the $10.8 billion? Or I guess another way of asking, is that number sustainable and a good jumping-off point for expenses from here?', 'Okay. And is the first quarter typically high on expenses because of the seasonality of the investment bank revenues?', \"Okay. And then, could you also just clarify the comments about the NIM, and then interest margin in the second half of the year, John. You're selling some businesses now have an impact on NIM, but it sounded like there might be some actions you could take to mitigate that?\", \"Okay. And just on a related point to that, John, I was hoping I could ask Mike a question in terms of the CCAR. Mike, you passed the CCAR, I presume you've heard back from regulators in terms of how you did, and maybe new MRA. Could you share any thoughts on what kind of feedback you received and what you'd work on for next submission? And then related to OneMain, is it too early to ask if the OneMain transaction goes through as planned, would you consider maybe making an off cycle request to add on to your existing approval, with an update for capital that might get released when OneMain goes away?\", 'Okay.

First of all, was a lot of that in December, after a more successful first couple of months? Or was it a little bit more spread over the period?

Or was it just more because of a decline in customer activity levels?', 'The final question I have for you is on the net interest margin, which declined pretty much in line with the guidance that you had given us early in the quarter.

You guys, I think, over the year-to-date have probably released just a little over $300 million in reserves.

And they seem pretty confident releasing, but obviously, that's fine. On the iBank side, maybe getting to the expense question in another way. Year-to-date, I think if you normalize the DVA or CVA, however you want to define it, your revenues are down close to 19% in S&B, but expenses were up, I think, 11%. Obviously, you put a lot of investment into this year. Should we start to see, assuming we have a better rate revenue environment, some operating leverage on the expense base in 2011 and beyond?\", 'One last question on the Securities investment portfolio. It was down, I think, $21 billion on a period-end basis. Is that sort of positioning for the rate environment? What is your stance vis--vis rates at this point?', 'Correct.'], 'VikramPandit': [\"John, thank you, and good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us today. 2010 was a very good year for Citi. We made excellent progress in executing our strategy in every major area and, as a matter of fact, if you had said a year ago that we would have accomplished what we have, I'm not so sure too many people would have believed it. Yet, we were profitable in each quarter, earning $10.6 billion for the year. Revenues increased for the quarter and for the year in two of our three core businesses, which are Transaction Services and Consumer Banking, and Securities and Banking had strong full year results.\", \"Matt, it's also fair to say that we have a smaller Equity business compared to some of the other firms on the street and we're building that out. And we also have a smaller Commodities business, that also is being built out. So a lot more of our revenues are driven by the Fixed Income business.\", \"Betsy, obviously, all of us still have to go through the process with the regulators and I think that's going to be informative for us, all of us. But as importantly, we want to make sure that we are exactly in the right place on Basel III. And including, by the way, as I've said in the past, we think it's always prudent to carry a little bit of a cushion. You take all that into account, we still think 2012 is the right year for us to return capitals.\", \"Well, I think some of that is -- let us start the other way. A lot of that is the decline in Citi Holdings and the risk that goes down through that. And that's a continual process. We're still in the process of selling a couple of businesses there, that should take risk down. We've got assets in SAP that are going to come down, as well. And so when you look at risk weighted assets coming down, that's going to be the biggest contributor. And we've said in the past that some of that would like to reinvest in building out Citicorp, although that depends on how and where the opportunities to help our clients are going to be. So that is part of our thinking in what drives us to say what John Gerspach said earlier, that if 8% to 9% is the kind of range we're on in Basel III, 2012 is the year that we ought to be able to achieve that.\", \"Well, we can't tell you what we say with our regulators and what they say to us. But what I can tell you is what I've said, again, 2012 is the year we think we'll have the ability to return capital, of course, based on our discussion with our regulators.\", \"Well, I think the way to -- let's start with the very big picture. The Card business is very different than when we moved the partner cards into the Citi Holdings, and that is a consideration that we are well aware of. Having said that, the biggest consideration for us is to run the partner cards in a very optimal way and Zales is an indication of that because there's a lot of franchise value in that, and there's a lot of value in that particular business and we're building that out. We've done nothing to change our view, that is still in Citi Holdings and that remains a driving concern. But I'll also tell you that as with everything we've done through Citi Holdings, our primary goal still continues to be we won't do anything with assets that's not in our shareholders interest and we have clearly that in mind. And that is not going to be impacted by which portfolio we have or how it turns over or any of that. It really comes down to the kind of value we think that Card business represent to us and we want to recognize it for you.\", \"Again, what I would say on that is we haven't changed our mind, it's still in Holdings and it is still part of the assets that we want to rationalize. But obviously, as we do that, we will look at every other option before we make a decision.\", \"We're still exactly where we said we were before and, if you look at how Citicorp is growing, the International Consumer business has done well. We also think the GTS business with the book of business we're building, especially as interest rates change, will start showing some of that through as well. So when you put all of that together and, really, the change in the business models in our Securities and Banking business, we think all of that still takes us back to 1.25, 1.5 on assets that we ought to be able to recognize on a longer-term basis. And of course, interest rate environments are also important in terms of where and how we get to that.\", \"I think we've said that, that's a kind of business that should be able to earn 1.25 and 1.5 in much more of a normalized environment. And normalized we were talking about is, of course, credit taking account but as credit changes, that's one of the factors and got to say interest rates are another factor, too.\", \"Let me take a crack and then, John, will add to that as well. I think the first part, I would say, is that for us or anybody else, some of the definitional issues still have to be worked through. A lot of the measurement issues are still going to have to be worked through and we've said in the past and I'll say again, we think 2011 is a year where a lot of those details get worked out. That's an important part to it. And the second part of that is that we do want to manage our business in a prudent way, which is why we said we want to carry a cushion. And putting all of those things into account, we think its prudent to think about returning capital in 2012.\", 'No, there are no systematic issues other than those that are generic for everybody.', \"Well, first of all, the emerging markets, that is a broad group. We know what's happening in certain areas. You see it in South Africa, you see it in China, which is the growth in inflation there. And especially those countries that don't have a flexible currency are seeing more of that and there is growth adjustment there, as a resultl of these changes. But I would say that the underlying dynamics of the consumers in these markets and the growth models actually finding a real kind of a solid development model has not really changed. And so we expect to see a continued increase in loan demand. We expect to see continued increase in capital markets activities. We expect to see continued growth, not only in the Asian markets, but also in the Latin American and some of the African markets. Some of the Eastern European markets are still linked to Europe and that is a longer process. But we remain constructive on the emerging markets, understanding that monetary tightening and other kind of breaks may have to be put on from time to time to manage the overheating that can occur and the inflation that occurs. I think the real question still keeps coming back to the U.S. economy, in our view, and what kind of growth you're going to see and what's going to happen to housing prices and it is still the largest economy in the world and that is going to be something the markets are going to have to watch over the next two, three quarters. And that's why I think, when I started, I said that the macro still going to dominate the micro here for the next two, three quarters.\", \"Sure. I mean, I think first of all, you see our account activity is pretty strong in terms of account opening. Our loan growth continues there. We have seen the linkage between Mexico and the U.S. turnaround the GDP, and we still think that leverage is pretty powerful. And so if the U.S. economy starts doing better, you're going to start to see that in Mexico, as well. Everybody knows the more macro social issues that are occurring there. When you look at our mix of branches, we happen to be in a lot of the major sort of areas. We're everywhere obviously in Mexico but we feel that, given some of the social issues, we're in the right places for capturing the right kind of population there. And so I don't know if there's anything specific you had in mind, but we continue to be very constructive on our business in Mexico, and we're also expecting that business to continue to grow as a result of some of these fundamental turnarounds in the GDP numbers of the country.\", \"No, I'm not going to go into the individual strategy that, that particular desk had employed. But as I said, it generated about $150 million of revenue in the third quarter and virtually $0 million in the fourth.\", \"Let me put it the other way. If you're trying to read anything more systematic into it, there isn't. These are strong businesses, we've got very strong franchises in the local currency areas. As you know, we've got a very strong G10 business. We're building out our Equity business. So we actually remain very positive in terms of the amount and the size of our client, flow of client activity continues to be robust. If you put it all together, again, this is a business that we continue to believe it's going to be a big contributor going forward.\", \"Moshe, that's an important question. The good news is we've got a few quarters to think about it. Because as we said before, this is a 2012 thing and, of course, the usual discussions will apply on stock repurchases versus dividends and all that kind of stuff, and sort of think we should pick up little bit later.\", \"Well, look, I think we're all, I said the next few quarters, now it could be a couple of quarters, but let me say that, again, we've got to watch what happens in the U.S. and that's still the biggest economy. We see a lot of constructive signs. Credit seems to be getting better, as well. But we want to see employment rise. We want to see GDP grow correctly. And these are all going to be important things. If at some point, though, the economy feels like whatever the rate it is at, it's more stable and recovering and is on a trajectory, that takes down a little bit of the uncertainty in the marketplace. And of course, I'm also hoping the next two, three quarters shed some more light in some of the leverage related issues in Europe, as well. And so it just feels to us that when you look at the world and the growth in the emerging markets, when we look at kind of what's going on in Europe and the U.S. that these next few quarters are going to be really important. Now that's not a prediction, that's just a perspective.\"], 'JohnMcDonald': [\"I wanted to try to just ask Betsy's question on the capital just maybe on a slightly different angle. The question comes up a lot on investor conversations. I guess what we struggle with is, you're at the high end of peers on all the capital ratios and most of the other big banks are talking about kind of a medial hopes of capital deployment. So as we look at it, we kind of ask a question to what degree is perhaps Citigroup is being conservative? Or is your implementation of the various Bassels more complicated or less certain to the international aspect of your businesses? Could you help us get a little closer to reconciling that?\", 'And is there any international aspect of the business changes the Basel implementation or is that just getting too deep?', 'John, quick question on the tangible book value impacts. Could you just walk through how the AOCI and maybe the DTA, if there are any impact affected the tangible book value this quarter?', \"And then regarding regulatory capital ratios and DTA to recapture, now that you've been profitable for a few quarters, what's needed to allow for the consumption of DTA to where your regulatory capital might grow faster than your net income at some point?\", 'So geographic mix, really. Last thing is on revenue form question. Do you have any initial thoughts on the potential changes in the methodology for calculating FDIC premiums or so-called tester amendment?', \"Have you done any calculations that you could share or any thoughts on how that change in the FDIC methodology might affect you in 2011 or '12?\", \"Just from a '10, '11 absolute dollars doubling potentially?\", 'John, can you just tell us where the DTA ended up and how much of that was allowable? I might have just missed it in the disclosure.'], 'Operator': [\"Hello, and welcome to Citi's Fourth Quarter 2010 Earnings Review with Chief Executive Officer, Vikram Pandit; and Chief Financial Officer, John's Gerspach.

You may now disconnect.\"], 'MosheOrenbuch': ['Could you talk a little bit, maybe, about how you think about once you do get to capital return, how you think about the pace or mix as it relates to things like the shrinkage in the balance sheet from Citi Holdings and the like?', \"On the proprietary trading commentary before, that wasn't that you changed the focus of the business. That was just the revenue output in the quarter, right, John?\"], 'ChristophKotowski': [\"If I could go back at the trading question a little bit. You said take a longer view of it and fixed income went from $21 billion in full year '09 to  $14 billion this year. I'm curious, is that kind of all geographies, all products? Or is it primarily the impact of the European peripheral country credit?\", 'Was there an impact just from long rates rising during the quarter? Was that the primary impact?', 'And then on the $255 million net interest income adjustment, is that something that we should think of as a one-time reserve or is that an ongoing item? Or how long does it go on for?', \"And then finally, your expense guidance, I believe, previously was $11.5 billion a quarter, give or take, and now we're at $12 billion to $12.5 billion. Should we assume that, that comes straight out of pre-provision earnings or do we expect revenue increases to offset that to at least some degree?\"], 'BetsyGraseck': [\"One was back in the sales and trading commentary, you were giving one of the reasons for the down quarter was market making as well as principal position. I'm wondering how to read that in terms of what might be permanent versus cyclical? Is part of this your positioning for the vulcur [ph] exit versus market  making and assuming market or what have you?\", \"Separate question on capital. I know that the proposal period is ongoing right now with the regulators and you probably can't talk about you've asked for, but I just wanted to ask if you are thinking about whether or not you can do anything this year. I know that in your opening remarks, you discussed returning capital to shareholders in 2012. Is that the earliest date that you're anticipating a return of capital to shareholders?\", \"I would think you're looking at your business as well to how much capital you think you need to hold to run your business. Can you talk to what you think those numbers are over time?\", 'So did you ask for capital action in your proposal to regulators?', 'On Retail Partner Card, I noticed that you retained the Zales account. Would you be able to bring Retail Partner Cards from Citi Holdings into Citicorp before those marketing agreements are up? Or would it be a rebidded marketing agreement, you win, you keep them in Citicorp? How should I think about that?', \"So if it's positive, you would bid for it? If you think there's going to be an accretion to your...\", 'And then last on ROA outlook. Vikram, in the past, you have talked about what your ROA outlook is for Citicorp. Has there been any change to that?', 'Higher rates is a function of your $125 million to $150 million?'], \"MatthewO'Connor\": [\"I guess just a bigger picture question on trading. I can appreciate that it's volatile for everyone, it can depend on the mix quarter-to-quarter. But just in general, it seems like you're trading is a little more volatile, very weak quarter here and then all of a sudden, a very strong quarter. And is that just a difference in the product mix or something else that you could point to? And could we see a little less volatility going forward?\", \"Obviously, we're still getting results this quarter, but I guess we can see at the end of the quarter. But it felt like it's been a little more volatile.\", 'And then just a couple of model questions going forward. You had a very modest tax credit this quarter. How should we think about the tax rate next year?', 'And then just lastly, another follow-up on the expenses. As we think about 2011 expenses, you mentioned some of the puts and takes in terms of investment spend, as well as assets freeing up or as you run off assets and free up some expenses, should we think about the first half of expenses being higher or lower than the second half? Or more of a steady throughout the year?']})\n"
